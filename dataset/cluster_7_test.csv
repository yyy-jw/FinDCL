Brian Ballard, CEO and co-founder of APX Labs, lives in a series of cycles. Each cycle starts with research, transitions to development, proceeds to testing, and so on, just like the rest of the tech world, in an endless loop of process and improvement. Every now and then, if your process is on track, if your product delivers, the loop offers exclamations.
This year could be filled with exclamations for Ballard, his company and his corner of the industry.
APX Labs has carved its wearables niche in developing software for major names in oil, gas and defense (including General Electric, an investor and customer). The company is near the front of the pack for manufacturing wearables—and its smart glasses are poised for a big 2016. An impressive round of tech was introduced last month at CES in Las Vegas and this week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain.
“Smart glasses really cemented themselves as something companies were using in 2015, but … it takes almost a year to get through everything,” Ballard said. “You’ll start seeing them used on a much larger scale than they were in 2015: Moving from one line to the whole factory, or from one factory to the whole bullpen of factories that support a process.
“There are still some areas inside logistics that we won’t see—the hardware can’t replace all the tools used today—but in field service and manufacturing, I think you’re going to see a big uptick in the technology.”
Smart glasses might not even have the biggest chunk of the market, at least when consumer sales are included. A recent study from IDC forecasts about 160 million wearables shipped in 2019, with more than 120 million of them headed for your wrist. (About 25 million wearables were shipped in 2014, and close to 80 million last year.) Clothing, eyewear, modular and earwear will make up almost all of the remaining quarter.
As consumer appetite for wearables continues to drive innovation, the next five to seven years will include some incredible products like the Daqri Smart Helmet, Kopin Smart Glass, all sorts of virtual and augmented reality headsets, industry applications for smart glasses and smart watches, and, soon, ingestibles that track you from the inside out.
For manufacturers, “the same platform your supervisors are using is the same one your technicians are using and the same one your supply chain is using. It’s a hyperconnected, multiplayer work environment,” Ballard said. “We don’t see this as just a bunch of individual users working together. We see it as a team working together—with your existing legacy systems, with your robotics, with your IoT [Internet of Things]—and all that together could be a game-changer.”
The loop of process and improvement will circle on, toward another revolution, and another, and another.

"Yet another major health insurance provider is reportedly poised to pull out of the Obamacare markets. The news comes as Congress and the White House bicker over what to do next afterthe House Republicans’ American Health Care Act failed.
On the heels of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) failure to get enough memberson board with the GOP’s deeply unpopular Obamacare replacement bill, Anthem, Inc., may be prepping to leave the exchanges established under former President Barack Obama’s signature health care legislation, Reuters reported.
In 2018, Jeffries analysts said,Anthem “is leaning toward exiting a high percentage” of the 144 insuranceregionswhere the company currentlyparticipates in the federal program.
“We continue to actively pursue policy changes that will help with market stabilization and achieve the common goal of making quality health care more affordable and accessible for all,” Anthem said in a statement.
The balance of sick and healthy patients has been worse than anticipated, resulting in major double-digit premium increases this year. Based on information released in October 2016 by the Obama administration, premiums soared by an average of 25 percent.
Some states saw much larger jumps. Premiums in Arizona, for example, increased by a staggering 116 percent at the start of the new year.
Health care providers are growing increasingly unsureabout how to navigate the insurance market, as concerns over the stability of Obamacare continue and lawmakers fail to reach any sort of consensus onhow to address the issue.
In February, Aetna CEOMark Bertolini described Obamacare as a “death spiral.”
“It’s not going to get any better; it’s getting worse,” he said during an interview at a Wall Street Journal event focused on the future of health care.
Bertolini did not say whether Aetna will completely withdraw from the Obamacare markets next year. However, the company has already severely scaled back its presence in the government markets. In August 2016, Aetna announced it would pull out of most Obamacare exchanges because of major financial loses.
Just one day before the Aetna executive made his comments about the embattled Affordable Care Act, Humana announced it will completely withdraw from the Obamacare exchange program in 2018. According to an internal analysis, Humana is projecting loses of up to $45 million on Obamacare business in 2017.
“We are again seeing signs of an unbalanced risk pool based on the results of the 2017 open enrollment period,” CEO Bruce Broussard said during an investors call in February. “Therefore, we’ve decided we can’t continue to offer this coverage in 2018.”
Also, fewer people signed up for the Obamacare exchanges this year than in years prior. AfterPresident Donald Trump pulledads for the health care program, reminding stragglers to sign up for coverage by the Jan. 31 deadline, only around 9.2 million peopleenrolled.
That number is down from the 9.6 million who signed up a year ago. And, in the final two weeks of enrollment, only 376,000 people enrolled, compared to the nearly 700,000 who signed up at the same time in 2016.
Four years ago, the Congressional Budget Office forecasted 201 million people would have private health insurance in any given month in 2016. However, according to a 2016 CBO report, only 177 million people — on average — had private coverage, marking a shortfall of 24 million people. Furthermore, in 2016, the CBO slashed its original projection of 21 million new enrollees to just 13 million.
So what do the Republicans — who control both chambers of Congress and the White House — plan to do about the problems plaguing the insurance market? It’s anyone’s guess.
Trump took to Twitter Thursday evening to lambaste the conservative Freedom Caucus, blaming them for the failure of the GOP-backed plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.The president vowed to “fight” caucus membersin 2018, even though the bill was also rejected my moderate members of the Republican Party.
The AHCA was rejected by members of the conservative wing of the GOPbecause — in their view — the bill did not fully repeal Obamacare, a promise they have made to their constituents.
In a series of tweets Friday aimed at Trump, the House Freedom Caucus stood their ground. The members of the caucus said they are“committed to keeping our promise” to fully repeal Obama’s signature legislation.
One Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho), sent a tweet of his own to the president. “Freedom Caucus stood with when others ran,” he wrote. “Remember who your real friends are. We’re trying to help succeed.”
Trump promised in January to provide “insurance for everybody,” though he didn’t offer specifics about how he planned to accomplish that goal. He also told the New York Timeshe wanted to see Obamacare replaced with a Republican alternative “very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.”
For right now, though, it appears the Republicans are back to square one.",0
"A US navy commander says that Russian surveillance ships are shadowing American and NATO vessels which are taking part in a major military drill in the Baltic Sea
Vice Admiral James G. Foggo, who is leading the major exercise, said “What we have seen is shadowing by two Russian intelligence vessels”
He added that the Russian ships were “well behaved” but have refused to communicate with the U. S. Navy despite coming as close as one mile at times with U.S. and allied vessels.
The exercise, involving US and NATO vessels, includes more than 40 ships and some 6,000 sailors, airmen and marines conducting training operations from June 3-19.
Non-NATO counties Finland and Sweden are also participating.
Foggo, who is the commander of US 6th Fleet, said Russian forces had been “well behaved and professional on the high seas as we conducted our exercises.”
Foggo said a delegation from the US Navy met its Russian counterparts in Moscow last week to discuss the current maritime exercise.
They had “candid and frank discussions about how to operate professionally [and] not get in each other’s way,” he said, calling the meeting “productive.”
Foggo said the Russians had a habit of conducting sudden large-scale surprise or “snap” exercises in the region “that can make people nervous.”
Russia announced this week that it would be launching one of its “snap” exercises in the near future without sharing any of the details.
The NATO exercise comes amid continued strain in relations between Russia and NATO, which have been at odds since Crimea seceded from Ukraine and joined the Russian Federation following a referendum in March 2014.
NATO ended all practical cooperation with Russia in April that year over the ensuing crisis in Ukraine.
The West accuses Moscow of supporting pro-Russian forces in the Ukrainian conflict but Russia denies the allegation.
Tensions, billed by some as a resurgent Cold War, have seen NATO resorting to military buildup in Russia’s backyard and the latter staging military maneuvers and flying aircraft close to US destroyers in the Baltic Sea.",1

"The cruise industry continues to expand its aid efforts in the Caribbean in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Royal Caribbean this week dispatched one of its 24 vessels, the 3,114-passenger Adventure of the Seas, to hard-hit Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and St. Croix on a humanitarian mission that will include delivering relief supplies and evacuating people trying to get off the islands.
Adventure normally is based in San Juan, Puerto Rico but had been diverted to Florida after the storm barreled across the island late last week. It wasfree this week after Royal Caribbean canceled its Saturday departure out of San Juan. Royal Caribbean also has canceled next week's sailing of the vessel so it can continue helping with the relief effort. The ship will be bringing evacuees from affected islandsto Fort Lauderdale.

"South Korean and US intelligence officials detected missiles being transported away from North Korea’s Missile Research and Development Facility at Sanum-dong in the northern part of the capital.
The South claimed they could be intermediate Hwwasong-12 or intercontinental ballistic (ICBM) Hwasong-14 missiles.
However, the report stated the facility is dedicated to producing ICBMs.
South Korean officials have voiced concerns that North Korea could conduct more provocative acts near the anniversary of the founding of its communist party on October 10, or possibly when China holds its Communist Party Congress on October 18.
A source from South Korea’s Defence Ministry said he could not confirm details of the report or whether there have been any unusual activities in the area mentioned.
The secretive state threatened, via local media, to “shoot down” Donald Trump’s fighter jets after the US Air Force flew past the Demilitarised Zone.
The flyover marked the farthest north of the Demilitarised Zone any US fighter or bomber aircraft have flown off North Korea’s coast in the 21st century, chief Pentagon spokesman Dana White said last week.
In its editorial, the state-run North Korean outlet claimed: “The US flying its B-1B Lancers strategic bomber squadron over international waters in the East Sea was an immensely dangerous and reckless act that intends to drive the situation on the Korean Peninsula to extremes and an anti-North Korea provocation cannot be overlooked.
“The US’ bellicose, youthful bravado is rather fanning the will for retaliation among tens of millions of our soldiers and civilians.

"Report from US Geological Survey says northern wildfires must now be seen as significant driver of climate change, not just a side-effect
Report from US Geological Survey says northern wildfires must now be seen as significant driver of climate change, not just a side-effect
The devastating rise in Alaska’s wildfires is making global warming even worse than scientists expected, US government researchers said on Wednesday.
The sharp spike in Alaska’s wildfires, where more than 5 million acres burned last year, are destroying a main buffer against climate change: the carbon-rich boreal forests, tundra and permafrost that have served as an enormous carbon sink.
Northern wildfires must now be recognised as a significant driver of climate change – and not just a side-effect, according to the report from the US Geological Survey.
“This is one of the surprises that we haven’t talked about much,” said Virginia Burkett, chief climate scientist at the USGS. “It has tremendous implications for the carbon that is locked up in Alaska soils and vegetation.”
A record wildfire year – such as 2015 which was the worst in Alaska for a decade – had a measurable effect on the release of carbon dioxide and methane, which are the main drivers of climate change.
“Our scientists found that the balance of carbon storage versus release in Alaska was strongly linked with wildfires,” Burkett said. “In years where there was high wildfire activity the net carbon balance declined dramatically, and then it would rebuild in the absence of fire.”
Alaska is a far bigger storehouse for carbon than the lower 48 states, according to the USGS.
The state’s boreal forests, peat-rich tundra, and permafrost hold about 53% of US carbon. Alaska accounts for about 18% of US land mass.
Alaska currently absorbs about 3.7m tonnes of carbon a year, the USGS assessment found. But that vast storehouse of carbon has been breached by warming temperatures, thawing permafrost – and wildfire.
The USGS warned last year that Alaska could lose about a quarter of its permafrost by 2100, accelerating climate change.
In an average year, Alaska wildfires devour twice the area burned by wildfires in all of the lower 48 – and emit more greenhouse gases than all of those other wildfires combined, the USGS said.
Such fires across the northern US and Canada – which last month forced the evacuation of 80,000 from the Alberta tar sands town of Fort McMurray – were projected to increase over the coming decades as the climate continues to warm.
When it comes to wildfires, there is a triple effect on warming. Carbon stored in trees as well as the upper layers of soil is released back into the atmosphere during a fire. The burn also exposes the carbon-rich permafrost beneath, making it thaw more easily.
The northern US and Canada have already experienced a sharp rise in wildfires over the last few decades, with more to come.
Researchers predict a fourfold increase in northern wildfires because of warming and changes in rainfall, extending even to areas above the treeline.
The Arctic smashed through earlier heat records over this last winter – with temperatures at the North Pole hovering above zero degrees Celsius at the end of last year.
There were also shortages of snow, with organisers of the legendary Iditarod resorting to importing truckloads of white stuff for the start of the dog sled race.
The hotter and drier conditions were a recipe for more wildfires – with lightning strikes igniting more easily in drier soils and vegetation, and higher temperatures spreading the flames.
If average July temperatures top 13.4C (56.1F), there could be a big jump in wildfires in tundra regions such as Alaska’s North Slope and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta that were once too damp and cold to burn, the researchers found.",0

"The New York Times was the first to report that two members of SEAL Team Six were under investigation for Melgar's death at a US government compound near the American embassy in Bamako, the capital.
Melgar's cause of death was asphyxiation, according to a defense official familiar with the findings of the medical examiner's report.
Michelle Melgar, the victim's wife, has been notified her husband's manner of death was a homicide, the US official said.
She told CNN: ""I ask for privacy during this time -- I hope that you will allow me to tell my story when I'm ready. I knew him best -- he was my best friend. It's all so new -- I'm sorry.""
Melgar, a native of Lubbock, Texas, enlisted in the US Army in 2012 and began Special Forces training in 2013, according to the US Army Special Command statement. He served two deployments to Afghanistan.
The report of the mysterious death and resulting homicide investigation comes as the US undergoes heightened scrutiny about its military role Africa following the death of four US service members in Niger earlier this month.
Melgar was a member of the 3rd Special Forces Group, which is the primary unit responsible for Army special operations in northwest Africa, including Mali and Niger. The four American soldiers killed in Niger earlier this month were part of the same group.
Some Senate leaders expressed surprise about the extent of US military operations, renewing the debate over the authority for the United States' sprawling war on terror.
Amid growing questions about what went wrong during the deadly mission, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, said the US forces are in ""about 53 different countries"" in Africa.
Like neighboring Niger, Mali has faced significant, deadly extremism. Gunmen attacked a luxury resort in Mali the same month Melgar died, and in August there were two separate attacks on United Nations missions there.
CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated with CNN reporting on Logan Melgar's cause of death.",0

"Toys “R” Us Inc., which has struggled to lift its fortunes since a buyout loaded the retailer with debt more than a decade ago, is preparing a bankruptcy filing as soon as today, according to people familiar with the situation.
The Chapter 11 reorganization of America’s largest toy chain would deal another blow to a brick-and-mortar industry that’s already reeling from store closures, sluggish mall traffic and the threat of Amazon.com Inc.
Filing for bankruptcy would allow Toys “R” Us to restructure $400 million in debt that comes due next year, potentially letting the chain rebuild as a leaner organization. The retailer has hired a claims agent, which typically helps with administering such a process, people with knowledge of the situation said last week.And its vendors have been curtailing shipments amid concern that Toys “R” Us might not be able to pay its bills.
“This filing is really a buildup of financial problems over the past 15 years,”said Jim Silver, an industry analyst and the editor of toy-review site TTPM.com. “Finally, the straw broke the camel’s back.”
With speculation of a bankruptcy mounting, shares of Toys “R” Us’s vendors tumbled on Monday. Mattel Inc., the maker of Barbie and Fisher-Price, fell 6.2 percent -- its worst decline in seven weeks. Shares of Hasbro, the company behind Monopoly, Nerf and Transformers, dropped 1.7 percent.
A representative for Toys “R” Us declined to comment.
JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. are said to be vying to provide financing for Toys “R” Us while it goes through bankruptcy. Reorg Research said earlier Monday that a filing could come as soon as today.
The debtor-in-possession loan -- known as a DIP -- could be as much as $3 billion, a person with knowledge of the discussions said.
Ratings agencies have rushed to cut their credit ratings on Toys “R” Us to reflect the sinking market sentiment, indicating just how rapidly things have unraveled at the retailer. S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings both downgraded the toy seller Monday, citing media reports and market data pointing to an increased possibility of a broad restructuring. S&P cut its rating to CCC-, the third-lowest level. It had the retailer rated B- just two weeks ago, and Moody’s Investors Service still has a B3 rating and stable outlook for the name.
Much of the toy supplier’s debt is the legacy of a $7.5 billion leveraged buyout more than a decade ago. In 2005, Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust loaded Toys “R” Us up with debt to take it private. Since then, the Wayne, New Jersey-based chain has struggled to dig itself out.
Some years, the company had to spend as much as half a billion dollars on cash interest expenses alone, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Noel Hebert. That left Toys “R” Uswith less cash to put toward store expansions, merchandising, and -- crucially -- the growth of its online presence.
“With these debt levels, how much actual flexibility do you have in this environment?” asked Charles O’Shea, who covers Toys “R” Us for Moody’s Corp. “You have to invest online -- because your principal competitors there are really good -- and you’ve got to deal with the debt load and your maturities on top of that. The pie is only so big.”
Chapter 11 also will help the company get out of burdensome leases, said Craig Johnson, head of Customer Growth Partners.
“The idea being, after a period of time, you work yourself out of Chapter 11 and you go on being a smaller, but financially more healthy retailer,” he said.
In 2015, Toys “R” Us named Dave Brandon as its chief executive officer, turning to the former head of Domino’s Pizza Inc. to attempt a comeback. Brandon had run Domino’s for 11 years and gained a reputation as a turnaround artist. He helped shepherd the pizza chain, then owned by Bain Capital Partners, through the largest initial public offering in restaurant history in 2004.
Brandon showed signs of progress in early 2016, when the company posted its first holiday sales gain in four years.
That year, the chain extended maturities on some of its borrowings, giving it more time to execute Brandon’s plan. As part of his revival effort, he has been sprucing up stores with more toy demonstrations and other experiences.
But the comeback faltered in the more recent Christmas season. Same-store sales dropped 2.5 percent during the final nine weeks of last year, hurt by sluggish demand and deep discounts. The toy seller had to reckon with new competitors driving prices lower and lower, O’Shea said.
Brandon, 65, lamented the price competition during a conference call in June.
“Make no mistake about it, there is a little bit of a price war situation right now,’’ Brandon said.
As the woes have piled up, the cost of insuring against default on Toys “R” Us debt has surged. Prices on six-month and one-year swaps have climbed to record highs, suggesting the market is pricing in all-but-certain odds of a Chapter 11 filing, which protects companies against creditors during a reorganization.
Credit default swaps expiring in December traded at more than 75 points upfront Monday. That means it would cost about $7.5 million to insure $10 million of Toys “R” Us debt.
Toys “R” Us’s bonds have been hammered. Its 7.375 percent notes due 2018traded for as little as 18 cents during Monday’s session, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That’s down from 97.25 cents on Aug. 30.
If Toys “R” Us can get its debt under control again, the chain still has promise, TTPM’s Silver said. Its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization has been good, he said.
“If they didn’t have the debt would be making $500 to $600 million a year in profit,” he said. “The problem is the debt.”

"Mercedes-Benz could become an independentdivision of German luxury automaker Daimler AG, the company said Monday.
Daimler's trucks-and-buses division and itsfinancial services business could also become independent divisions in a potential change aimed at giving the units ""greater entrepreneurial responsibility,"" the company said in an announcement toinvestors.
The planshave not been given final approvaland would not include divesting the businesses. Daimler said it would invest a three-digit million euro amount and consult with employee representatives while continuing steps toward the tentative split.
""Daimler is today facing an exceptional challenge: On the one hand, we are more successful than everbefore; on the other hand, our business is changing like never before,"" said Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler's board of management and head of Mercedes-Benz Cars. ""Whoever aims for sustainable competitiveness and profitability must continuously evolve and adapt to rapidly changing surroundings.""
The potential change comes as carmakers worldwide appear to be envisioning a future in which internal combustion engines would increasingly be replaced by electric power. Additionally, some companies have had to cope with regulatory allegations that their diesel engines have failed to meet clean-air emission standards.
In July, Daimler said it would recall more than 3 million diesel vehicles in Europe to reduce nitrous oxide emissions.
If final approval for the new corporate structure is given, Daimler said the splitswould include three independent entities: Mercedes-Benz Cars & Vans, Daimler Trucks & Busesand Daimler Financial Services AG. Each would continue to maintain registered offices in Germany under Daimler.
Daimler said it does not plan to pursue job reductions as part of the potential plan.
The company's Board of Management and Daimler's supervisory board won't make a final decision on the plan until tax-related issues, due diligence checks and other assessments and negotiations have been completed. Should the board decide to move forward, the plan wouldrequire approvalfromDaimler shareholders, who would voteon the proposalno soonerthan 2019, the company said.
Additionally, Daimler said it plans to contribute 3 billion euros to Daimler's German pension fund in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to approval from the company's supervisory board. The company also said it is reinforcing its employees' pension commitments.",0
"DETROIT - At least 36 people have been killed in crashes involving General Motors (GM) vehicles with faulty ignition switches.
Attorney Kenneth Feinberg, who was hired by GM to compensate victims, updated the totals Monday. His office indicated that least 44 people have been seriously injured in accidents linked to the defective part.  Feinberg says he has received 229 death claims and 1,986 injury claims since August.
The fund has made compensation offers to 57 of the 80 eligible claimants so far. Thirty-five have accepted, and 20 have been paid.
GM knew about faulty ignition switches in Chevrolet Cobalts and other small cars for more than a decade but didn't recall them until February. The switches can slip out of the ""on"" position, which causes the cars to stall, knocks out power steering and turns off the air bags.
GM has recalled more than 30 million vehicles worldwide, including nearly 27 million in the U. S., this year because of a range of problems.
The auto giant initially claimed that 13 people died in crashes involving the defective switches, but GM later acknowledged that the death toll would go higher. Some lawmakers have estimated that the total death toll could climb to 100.",0
"If your ""internet of things"" dishwasher keeps flashing its lights, your smart oven turns on or off by itself, and your webcam-enabled robotic vacuum cleaner keeps stalking you from room to room, you might not be the victim of a poltergeist, but a hacker.
A vulnerability in almost one million LG smartThinQ internet-connected home devices can let hackers break into and take over all your gadgets, causing mayhem and invading personal privacy, Check Point security researchers disclosed Thursday. That includes any LG device or appliance connected to the account, including the robot vacuum, refrigerators, ovens, dishwasher, mashing machines and dryers, and air conditioners.
As opposed to hacking the individual devices, the researchers hacked the app that controls them, creating fake LG accounts and using them to take over real LG accounts.
“As more and more smart devices are being used in the home, hackers will shift their focus from targeting individual devices, to hacking the apps that control networks of devices. This provides cyber criminals with even more opportunities to exploit software flaws, cause disruption in users’ homes and access their sensitive data,” Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerability research at Check Point, said in a statement.
LG said it started working with the researchers in August after they brought it to their attention and developed a software patch at the end of September. Under best ethical practices, security researchers notify the vendor first and give them a chance to develop a fix before announcing the vulnerability to the world where bad actors could take advantage of it.
So what can you do?
LG smartThinQ users need to make sure to check their apps and make sure they're updated to the latest version.
To update their firmware, users should click on the ""smart home product"" under the smartThinQ application dashboard.
Over 400,000 LG Hom-Bot robotic vacuum cleaner were sold in the first half of 2016. In total, over 80 million smart home devices were shipped worldwide that year, according to IHS Markit, 64 percent more than in 2015.",0
"Chinese influence around the world continues to grow as on Aug. 11 they achieved a foothold into Europe through an acquisition of theGreek port of Piraeus.
COSCO, one of China’s largest shipping consortium’s, purchased a 51% share in the port of Piraeus as part of the Silk Road 2.0 initiative with the expectation of increasing that stake to 67% in the coming years.
China’s COSCO Shipping group has completed the acquisition of a 51 percent stake in the Greek port of Piraeus, becoming the controlling shareholder.
The company has paid $311 million for its major stake in Piraeus and plans to increase its share to 67 percent over the next five years. COSCO thus takes over Piraeus’ management and operation.
“The Piraeus project represents a key milestone in the Belt and Road initiative [Beijing’s initiative to boost China’s transport and trade links with Europe – Ed.], and the port’s growth and prosperity will boost economic development both in China and Greece, ushering in a new era of trade cooperation and cultural exchange between east and west,” said CEO of COSCO Shipping Wan Min.
The Port of Piraeus is a gateway to Asia, Eastern Europe, and North Africa. It handled 16.8 million passengers and 3.6 million 20-foot containers in 2014.
“The cooperation at Piraeus port is not just an economic collaboration but has strategic characteristics. Greece, via the Piraeus port, can indeed become China’s gateway into Europe to the benefit of China and Greece,” Pitsiorlas told Xinhua News Agency. – Russia Today
The European Union is at a tenuous point in the coalition’s history as economic problems. coupled with political upheavals, have shattered many long-standing alliances on the continent, as seen recently by Britain’s decision to leave the union.
Greece has forever been the pivot point for foreign entry into Europe since the EU decided to throw them to the wolves and refuse to implement a solid bailout of their financial system back in 2013. Indeed, even back when the Troika was playing hardball with Greece over their debt problems two years ago there was much talk of Russia offering a potential bailout to the beleaguered European state if Greece left the EU and moved into the Eurasian sphere of influence.
The future of the European Union may rest upon their ability to re-energize and reform political controls they have slowly enacted on member states over the past decade, causing many of these nations to seek partnerships outside of Europe simply to survive out of the continent’s Great Recession. And unless the government in Brussels begins to act quickly, and with some real temerity, economies like China and Russia will continue to gain more and more ground in Europe, and simply end the union’s power through acquisition of its vital industries.

"Washington (CNN)The conservative Koch brothers' political network plans to spend $889 million during the 2016 election cycle, according to media reports out of the network's donor meeting being held early this week in California.
The massive investment planned by groups founded by Charles and David Koch was announced in a Monday morning meeting at the Rancho Mirage Ritz Carlton, The Washington Post and Politico reported.

It means the Kochs' investment could rival the $1 billion that the Republican and Democratic nominees are each expected to raise and spend on the 2016 campaign -- and is more than double the $407 million their groups spent in 2012.
It would be more money than any private network has ever spent on an election cycle, with money coming from both the Koch brothers themselves and other donors.

The spending goal comes as the Koch brothers prepare to seek specific pledges from hundreds of donors at the end of their meeting, organized by the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce -- which then doles out money to a host of conservative groups within the Koch network.

"The Commerce Department on Sunday pushed back on published reports that Secretary Wilbur Ross has a stake in a company connected to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he did not previously disclose to lawmakers.
According to records obtained by the International Consortium of Journalists, Ross is an investor in Navigator Holdings, a shipping giant whose customers include Russian gas and petrochemical producer Sibur.
Putin’s son-in-law Kirill Shamalov once owned more than 20 percent of the company, but now holds a much smaller stake.
A Commerce spokesman told Fox News on Sunday that Ross was not involved with Navigator’s decision to engage in business with Sibur, a publicly traded company, which was not under sanction at the time and is not currently.
The spokesman also said Ross, the Trump administration’s point man on trade and manufacturing policy, “never met” Shamalov, and generally has supported the Trump administration’s sanctions against Russia, while recusing himself from matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels.
Still, the published reports by news agencies including NBC and the BBC likely will raise more questions about whether those associated with Trump are connected to Russia, amid special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether both sides colluded to influence the 2016 White House race.
Yet it wasn’t immediately clear how many partners Ross might have or what the profit-sharing agreement might be. The reports also indicated there was no sign Ross broke any disclosure rules.
ICIJ disclosed the Ross holding as part of reporting on 13.4 million records of offshore entities in tax havens leaked to German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
The newspaper then shared the records with ICIJ and a network of more than 380 journalists in 67 countries. The New York Times is its U. S. partner in this inquiry. The Times earlier reported on the Ross holding.
“In concealing his interest in these shipping companies —and his ongoing financial relationship with Russian oligarchs —Secretary Ross misled me, the Senate Commerce Committee, and the American people. Secretary Ross’ financial disclosures are like a Russian nesting doll, with blatant conflicts of interest carefully hidden within seemingly innocuous holding companies,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., in a statement to Fox News. “The Commerce Department’s Inspector General must open an inquiry immediately. Only after a thorough investigation can the American people be sure that Secretary Ross really has their best interests at heart —and that he hasn’t prioritized his own personal profits or those of Vladimir Putin or his Russian business partners.”
It wasn’t immediately clear exactly how much of Navigator, which is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Ross personally owns. ICIJ reported that Ross and other investors own four Cayman Island entities that in turn own 31.5 percent of Navigator, a stake worth $176 million at Friday’s closing stock price.
Ross’ stake in Navigator is likely a small fraction of that. In financial disclosure forms he filed with the government this year, Ross valued his holdings in the Cayman Island entities, which include other companies besides Navigator, at no more than $10.1 million.
Sibur contributed 8 percent to Navigator’s revenue last year, according to reports filed with securities regulators. Russia’s energy sector is largely controlled by individuals with ties to state actors, including Putin.
Much of the new trove of files includes bank statements, emails and loan agreements from Appleby, a law firm that helps set up offshore dummy companies and trusts. Appleby told the ICIJ that there is “no evidence” that it has done anything wrong.
Other records came from Asiaciti Trust, a family-run offshore specialist based in Singapore, and from 19 corporate registries maintained by governments in jurisdictions that draw the wealthy seeking privacy.
Big investments in two U. S. tech companies from a Russian government bank and Russian energy giant also have come to light.
The ICIJ reported that Silicon Valley investor and Russian citizen Yuri Milner got $191 million from VTB Bank, and invested that money in Twitter. The leaked records also show that a financial subsidiary of Russian energy company Gazprom funded a shell company that invested in a Milner-affiliated company that held roughly $1 billion in Facebook shares shortly before its 2012 initial public offering.
Milner told the ICIJ that he was unaware of any involvement by the Gazprom subsidiary in any of his deals and that none of his investments has been related to politics.
Milner also has invested in a tech-savvy real estate fund that was co-founded by Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner called Cadre. Milner told the ICIJ that he used his own money for the investment.
Sunday’s revelations follow last year’s release of records from a Panama-based firm involved in setting up offshore accounts. That disclosure triggered investigations in several countries, the resignation of the prime minister of Iceland and ouster of the leader of Pakistan. The Panama Papers also revealed that close associates of Russia’s leader Putin had been using the dummy accounts abroad to store their wealth, including a close Putin friend who had $2 billion of offshore assets.
There are legitimate reasons for setting up offshore accounts, but lax regulation and anonymity in some jurisdictions make it easy to launder money, evade taxes and avoid regulatory scrutiny. Critics of the widening gap between the super-wealthy and the rest have seized upon the use of tax havens as revealed in the Panama Papers as evidence of a crisis, and governments have promised to crack down.
In the case of Ross, the ICIJ reported Navigator’s Russian customer, Sibur, has ties to Putin in addition to his son-in-law.
A big shareholder is Gennady Timchenko, who was targeted by the U. S. and other western nations for sanctions after Russia’s invasion of the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014. A few months later, the U.S. barred banks from providing long-term financing to a gas company belonging to another large Sibur shareholder, Leonid Mikhelson. Mikhelson has also been sanctioned by the Treasury Department for propping up Putin’s rule.
Sibur itself was not targeted by the U. S. sanctions, but the Bank of America and the Royal Bank of Scotland reportedly backed away from doing business with the company.
The Russian gas producer last year contributed $23 million to Navigator’s revenue, an increase of more than 40 percent in two years.

"The one thing the radical left has yet to learn is “moderation” in that there’s a saturation point once achieved can no longer be absorbed, and it seems that after almost 11-months of continuous Trump bashing on those self-aggrandized celebrity award shows along with the constant drumming of the First Family by the unhinged Hollywood elites, the ratings are finally in, and what they’ve saying is that America has had enough!
However don’t take my word, simply observe the facts. On Sunday night MTV hosted the annual VMA awards show with Katy Perry who for whatever reason decided to turn herself into a more disgusting version of pop tart Miley Cyrus, if that’s possible.
And no sooner did the show began that it turned into a night of “Trump thumping” antics designed for adolescents, beginning with one unhinged celebrity after another, each attempting to out do the other with tasteless and crude jokes, moreover lacking any semblance of humorous creativity.
Obviously, like almost everything on the celebrity scene today, MTV has dummy down to where it’s is no longer recognized as a cutting edge and “edgy” anti-establishment and trend-setting, music maverick entity, but rather a predictable politically correct organization, pretending to be what it no longer is.
The evening wore on and on with host Perry doing her best Glenn Close imitation taking indiscriminate shots at the president, including announcing to the audience that “this [show] is one election where the popular vote actually matters.” She also insinuated that the “world is on fire,” and that we’re all inching closer and closer to a world looking like The Handmaid’s Tale.
Moreover, if you think you’ve heard those anti-trump jokes before you probably have, perhaps the script is being passed around from one celebrity awards show to another
All and all a fairly predictable and boring evening, once again don’t take my word, simply look at the ratings which hit an all-time low, in a country with over 330-million people of which 42-million are between the ages of 10 to 19, which is the MTV demographics, their biggest night attracted only 5.4 million viewers.
Do you think the general public has finally grown tired of the constant Trump bashing by the celebrity class?",1

"Barbarians at the Gate: Terrorism, the US, and the Subversion of Russia.
The shootings and bombings in Ingushetia and Dagestan this week rekindled a long-standing, brutal campaign of violence and terrorism in Russia’s Caucasus region – one that has seen more than its share of terror stretching back to the Chechen “rebellion” of the 1990s. However, in examining the recent attacks, it becomes clear that there are political and geopolitical interests behind the scenes that are actively working to destabilize Russia, with violence as their most potent weapon. The attacks are not simply isolated terrorist actions, but rather, cynically orchestrated events carried out by well-connected criminal networks whose goal is to foment conflict and carry out the agenda of the US intelligence establishment in its subversion of Russia.
The complex network of terrorist organizations that operate under the banners of “separatism” and “independence” for the Caucasus region, has been at the center of the destabilization of Russia for the last two decades. Within hours of the deadly attacks, the Kavkaz Center – an organization known to be the propaganda mouthpiece of terrorist leader Doku Umarov – released an article characterizing the attacks as heroic acts and referring to the dead as “Russian puppets.” Though this would seem to be not in keeping with the Center’s stated mission “to provide reporting of events…and assistance of journalistic work in the Caucasus,” this is, in fact, very much par for the course for an organization that is funded by the US State Department and Finland’s Foreign Ministry.
Image: “Russia’s Bin Laden,” Dokka Umarov led terrorist death squads in Chechnya during the 1990’s up until 2011 when the UN finally listed him as an Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists. At one point, Umarov even declared himself “Emir of the Russian North Caucasus.” His propaganda clearinghouse, the Kavkaz Center, was funded by the US State Department, as well as several supporting fronts including the National Endowment for Democracy-funded Russian-Chechen Friendship Society. The former currently supports US efforts to overthrow the Syrian government. The latter organization is currently backing the US State Department’s recent PR ploy, “Pussy Riot.”
Kavkaz Center has a long track record of supporting and legitimizing terrorist actions throughout the region, rationalizing atrocities committed in the name of “resistance.” In fact, Kavkaz engages in perpetual upside-down logic, referring to Russians as “terrorists” and terrorists as “heroes.” This type of Goebbles-esque propaganda is the hallmark of Western imperialist projects; most recently in the conflict in Syria, in which the Syrian National Council, Western corporate media and the like refer to terrorism and subversion as “rebellion and freedom-fighting”. Additionally, it is essential to note that Emarat Kavkaz (Umarov’s terrorist organization translated as “Caucasus Emirate”) has been listed by the United Nations as an organization associated with Al-Qaida. Kavkaz Center has been described by Umarov himself as “the official information organ of the Emarat Kavkaz.” This, of course, supports the claims made repeatedly by Moscow of the connection between Chechen and other extremists in the region and Al Qaida, a claim which, until recently, Kavkaz Center continued to deny.
Image: From UN.org, Chechen militant leader Dokku Umarov has been officially listed as a terrorist with ties to Al Qaeda. Paradoxically, the US is funding outfits supporting Umarov’s terrorist campaign against the Russian government. Once again, an internationally listed terrorist front, like Libya’s Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) now fighting in Syria, is the recipient of US funding and support in direct violation of both American and international law. (click image to enlarge)
Despite the fact that organs such as Kavkaz Center operate in the service of terrorists who advocate the destruction of Russia, their activity alone is not altogether significant if seen in a vacuum. Rather, it is the association of these types of individuals and organizations with the US State Department and US intelligence that makes them particularly insidious. One such entity that bears scrutiny is the American Committee for Peace in the Caucasus (ACPC), previously known as the American Committee for Peace in Chechnya. As reported by Right Web at the Institute for Policy Studies, “The ACPC was founded in 1999 by Freedom House, a neoconservative organization that has worked closely with the U. S. government, receiving funds from the National Endowment for Democracy and other U.S. democratization initiatives.” This intimate relationship between the ACPC and the US State Department indicates not merely a confluence of interests, but rather a direct relationship wherein the former is an organ of the latter.
Image: Over 30 years of supporting global terrorism – the Neo-Conservative establishment had created Al Qaeda in the mountains of Afghanistan in the 1980’s and has since used them as both provocateurs and a terrorist “foreign legion” everywhere from Serbia, to the Caucasus Mountains, to Iraq, Libya and now Syria. Readers should note that ACPC backing militants in Russia’s Caucasus region is affiliated with the Neo-Con run “Freedom House,” funded by the US State Department through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).
The paternalistic role of the US intelligence establishment in the ACPC is made all the more evident when one examines some of the more well known members of the ACPC including former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, former Pentagon advisor Richard Perle and other top neocons such as William Kristol, Elliott Abrams, Kenneth Adelman, and Robert Kagan – the last two being closely associated with the inner circle of the Romney campaign. What becomes apparent in even a cursory analysis of these figures is that, despite the preponderance of neoconservatives, the top members of the ACPC are pulled from both the liberal and conservative establishments. Therefore, one can see how the ACPC represents a bipartisan consensus within the US imperialist ruling class – a consensus of aggression against Russia. What should be even more concerning to political observers is that, given the very real possibility of a Romney victory in November, Russia may see a surge in separatism and violence supported overtly or covertly by the ACPC and a future Romney administration.
The ACPC has taken the lead in championing the cause of separatism and terrorism directed toward Russia, both tacitly and overtly. After having championed the cause of former Chechen Foreign Minister Ilyas Akhmadov in his quest for asylum in the United States – subsequently granted along with a generous taxpayer-funded stipend – ACPC member Zbigniew Brzezinski went so far as to write the foreward to Akhmadov’s book The Chechen Struggle. The alliance between political figures such as Akhmadov and terrorist leaders in the region demonstrates conclusively the partnership between the various terror networks and the imperialist ruling class in the West. Moreover, it shows that, along with oligarchs such as Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, the US and UK are still the favorite safe havens for criminals fleeing Russian justice.
Although the attacks of this week are tragic, their real significance is political in nature. There has been a sustained destabilization campaign waged by the West, particularly the United States, and aimed at President Putin going back to last December and the beginning of the so-called protest movement. The attempt by the Western imperialists has been to isolate Putin, demonize him, and erode his support within the country in hopes of toppling his government, thereby removing the biggest obstacle they face in implementing their hegemonic agenda. However, despite the financial backing, political demagoguery and media inundation, the attempts have entirely failed.
Once it became clear that Vladimir Putin would be reelected to a third term, the US State Department began its campaign against him. Organized and implemented by US Ambassador Michael McFaul in Moscow, the protest movement led by figures such as Alexei Navalny and Boris Nemtsov as well as US-funded NGOs such as GOLOS and the Moscow Helsinki Group, the movement essentially sought to instigate a “color revolution” in Russia using the same tactics that had been successful in Ukraine, Georgia and elsewhere. However, it was soon quite obvious to political observers in Russia and around the world that this movement was nothing more than a superficial destabilization attempt that had no real traction among the Russian people.",1

"The labor market may be changing, valuing workers with college degrees over those with lower education levels.
Yet that doesn't mean that good jobs aren't available for Americans with only a high school degree or some college, such as an associate's degree. The majority of workers fall into the latter category, since just one-third of adults have a bachelor's degree.
In fact, there are 30 million good jobs for less-educated workers that pay a median annual wage of $55,000, compared with 27 million of such jobs in 1991, a recent study from Georgetown University and JPMorgan Chase found.
So where are those good jobs? One industry tends to dominate, according to a new study from CareerCast: health care.
A few other trends jump out among the jobs identified as the best occupations for Americans without college degrees: skills are important, ranging from tech know-how to professions that require vocational training.
Nevertheless, earning a college degree is a often a better route to higher earnings, given that the Economic Policy Institute estimates workers with a bachelor's degree earn about 56 percent more than those who don't, CareerCast noted.
Read on to learn about the top 10 jobs for workers without a college degree.",0
"Back in August 2014, we reported that in what appeared a suspicious attempt to boost the pool of eligible, credit-worthy mortgage recipients, Fair Isaac, the company behind the crucial FICO score that determines every consumer’s credit rating, “will stop including in its FICO credit-score calculations any record of a consumer failing to pay a bill if the bill has been paid or settled with a collection agency. The San Jose, Calif., company also will give less weight to unpaid medical bills that are with a collection agency.” In doing so, the company would “make it easier for tens of millions of Americans to get loans.” Stated simply, the definition of the all important FICO score, the most important number at the base of every mortgage application, was set for an “adjustment” which would push it higher for millions of Americans.
As the WSJ said at the time, the changes are expected to boost consumer lending, especially among borrowers shut out of the market or charged high interest rates because of their low scores. “It expands banks’ ability to make loans for people who might not have qualified and to offer a lower price [for others],” said Nessa Feddis, senior vice president of consumer protection and payments at the American Bankers Association, a trade group.” Perhaps the thinking went that if you a borrower has defaulted once, they had learned your lesson and will never do it again. Unfortunately, empirical studies have shown that that is not the case.
Now, nearly three years later, in the latest push to artificially boost FICO scores, the WSJ reports that “many tax liens and civil judgments soon will be removed from people’s credit reports, the latest in a series of moves to omit negative information from these financial scorecards. The development could help boost credit scores for millions of consumers, but could pose risks for lenders” as FICO scores remain the only widely accepted method of quantifying any individual American’s credit risk, and determine how much consumers can borrow for a new house or car as well as determine their credit-card spending limit
The transformation is already in proces as the three major credit-reporting firms, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, recently decided to remove tax-lien and civil-judgment data starting around July 1, according to the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group that represents them. The firms will remove the adverse data if they don’t include a complete list of a person’s name, address, as well as a social security number or date of birth, and since most liens and judgments don’t include all three or four, the effect will be like wiping the slate clean for millons of Americans. This change will apply to new tax lien and civil-judgment data that are added to credit reports as well as existing data on the reports.
Civil judgments include cases in which collection firms take borrowers to court over an unpaid debt. Ankush Tewari, senior director of credit-risk assessment at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, says that nearly all judgments will be removed and about half of tax liens will be removed from credit reports as a result of the changed approach. He says LexisNexis will continue to offer the data directly to lenders.
In addition, if public court records aren’t checked for updates on lien and judgment information at least every 90 days, they will have to be removed from credit reports.
The outcome of this change is clear: it “will make many people who have these types of credit-report blemishes look more creditworthy.“
The WSJ notes that the unusual move by the influential firms comes partially in response to regulatory concerns. The three reporting bureaus rarely tinker with the information that goes on credit reports and that lenders consult to gauge consumers’ ability and willingness to pay back debts.
The regulatory push to boost America’s creditworthiness started at the top, under the guise of improving data tracking and collection:
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this month released a report citing problems it found while examining credit bureaus and changes it is requiring. Issues the agency cited included improving standards for public-records data by using better identity-matching criteria and updating records more frequently.
Inaccurate information on credit reports, especially if it is negative information, can derail consumers from being able to gain access to credit and even lead to other setbacks like not being able to rent an apartment or get a job.
One in five consumers has an error in at least one of their three major credit reports, according to a 2013 Federal Trade Commission study mandated by Congress. The three credit bureaus received around eight million requests disputing information on credit reports in 2011, according to the CFPB.
It won’t be the first time such an exercise is conducted: in 2015, as part of a settlement with the NY AG, credit-reporting firms were already prompted to remove several negative data sets from reports. These included non-loan related items that were sent to collections firms, such as gym memberships, library fines and traffic tickets. The firms also will have to remove medical-debt collections that have been paid by a patient’s insurance company from credit reports by 2018.
What happens next?
Such changes might help borrowers and could spur additional lending, possibly boosting economic activity. But it could potentially increase risks for lenders who might not be able to accurately assess borrowers’ default risk.
Consumers with liens or judgments are twice as likely to default on loan payments, according to LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a unit of RELX Group that supplies public-record information to the big three credit bureaus and lenders.
For lenders and credit card companies it means one thing: chaos, and the potential of substantial future charge offs: “It’s going to make someone who has poor credit look better than they should,” said John Ulzheimer, a credit specialist and former manager at Experian and credit-score creator FICO.
“Just because the lien or judgment information has been removed and someone’s score has improved doesn’t mean they’ll magically become a better credit risk.”
So how many US consumers will be impacted by this change? The answer: up to 12 million.
As the WSJ points out “removing this information from credit reports also will lead to changes in people’s credit scores. Roughly 12 million U. S. consumers, or about 6% of the total U.S. population that has FICO credit scores, will see increases in those scores as a result of this change, according to the company that created the FICO system, which is used by lenders in most U.S. consumer underwriting decisions.”
While for many of these consumers, the score increase will be relatively modest, as FICO projects that just under 11 million people will experience a score improvement of less than 20 points, that should be more than sufficient to go out and buy that brand new $60,000 BMW with an 80-month, $0 down, 0% interest rate loan.
Sarcasm aside, ultimately lenders will still be able to check public records on their own to find this information, and since FICO scores will now be “adjusted” just like GAAP, the likely outcome will be the transition of credit vetting in house, as Fair Isaac loses credibility within the loan system, potentially leading to even more draconian credit terms, even if it comes at substantial expense to US-based lenders.

"The United States of Genocide: Putting the US on Trial for Genocide Against the Peoples of Korea, Laos, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Iraq, and Elsewhere
The United States of America was built on a foundation of genocide against the Indigenous peoples of North America. In fact, all successful settler colonial societies are founded in genocide. The process is one of dispossession – the erasure of one group identity and the imposition of another on the people and/or on the land. But genocide is not merely the foundation of the US nation state, it is also the foundation of the US empire. The US habit of genocide has not died, but has transformed. The US has become a serial perpetrator of genocide with the blood of many millions of innocents spilled in pursuit of imperial hegemony.
There is a fight going on for the very meaning of the term “genocide”. Western powers assert their right to accuse enemies of committing genocide using the broadest possible definitions whilst also touting a twisted undefined sense of “genocide” which can never, ever be applied to their own actions. Aotearoa (New Zealand) Prime Minister John Key, apparently taking his cue from the US, is currentlypushing for reformof the UN Security Council such that the veto power would be unavailable. The UNSC is a political body and “genocide” will simply become a political term cited by powerful states to rationalise aggression against the weak. Keynotoriously saidthat his country was “missing in action” because it did not invade Iraq in 2003, reminding Kiwis that “blood is thicker than water”. If his desired reforms existed now, the US would probably have a UN Security Council resolution authorising the use of force against Syria on the grounds of “genocide”.
All of those who oppose Western aggression justified as humanitarian intervention under the “responsibility to protect” must stop burying their heads in the sand over this matter. This is a very real fight for the future of humanity. We can either learn and propagate the understanding that US imperial interventions are, by nature, genocidal. Or we can just pretend the word has no meaning; indulge our childish moral impulses and the lazy fatuousness of our scholars and pundits and let Western mass-murderers use this Orwellian buzzword (for that is what “genocide” currently is) to commit heinous acts of horrific violence which ensure the continued domination of the world’s masses by a tiny imperialist elite.
US “Wars” are Actually Genocides
Every major military action by the US since World War II has first and foremost been an act of genocide. I do not state this as a moral condemnation. If I were seeking to condemn I would try to convey the enormous scale of suffering, death, loss and misery caused by US mass violence. My purpose instead is to correct a terrible misconception of US actions – their nature, their meaning and their strategic utility. This understanding which I am trying to convey is a very dangerous notion with an inescapable moral dimension because the US has always maintained that the suffering, death and destruction it causes are incidental to military purposes – they are instances of “collateral damage”. But, with all due respect to the fact that US personnel may face real dangers, these are not real wars. These are genocides and it is the military aspect that is incidental. In fact, it is straining credulity to continue believing in a string of military defeats being sustained by the most powerful military in the history of the world at the hands of impoverished Third World combatants. The US hasn’t really been defeated in any real sense. They committed genocide in Indochina, increasing the level of killing as much as possible right through to the clearly foreseen inevitable conclusion which was a cessation of direct mass violence, not a defeat. The US signed a peace agreement which they completely ignored. The Vietnamese did not occupy US territory and force the US to disarm and pay crippling reparations.
There is no question that the US has committed actions which fit the description of genocide. Genocide does not mean the successful extermination of a defined group (there is no such thing as “attempted genocide”). It was never conceived that way, but rather as any systematic attack on “a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.” Those who deny US genocides usually only deny that there is any intent to commit genocide. The UN definition of genocide (recognised by 142 states) is:
… any of the following acts committed withintent to destroy,in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
The US has committed these acts many times and in many different countries. Some people object that this is some watered down version of genocide that risks diluting the significance of this “ultimate crime”. However, bear in mind that the victims of US armed violence are not usually combatants and are not engaged in some sort of contested combat that gives them some ability to defend themselves or to kill or be killed. They are helpless as they die of incineration, asphyxiation, dismemberment, cancer, starvation, disease. People of all ages die in terror unable to protect themselves from the machinery of death. Make no mistake, that is what it is: a large complex co-ordinated machinery of mass killing. There is nothing watered down about the horrors of the genocides committed by the US, and their victims number many millions. The violence is mostly impersonal, implacable, arbitrary and industrial.
There are at least three specific times at which US mass violence has taken lives in the millions through direct killing: the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the wars and sanctions against Iraq in combination with the occupation of Iraq. I refer to them as the Korea Genocide (which was against both South and North Koreans), the Indochina Genocide (against Laotians, Cambodians, and Vietnamese), and the Iraq Genocide (which took place over at least a 20 year period).
There are many ways to show that the US committed genocides in these cases. On one level the case is straightforward. For example, if the US commits acts of “strategic bombing” which systematically kills civilians by the hundreds of thousands,andit turns out that not only is there no rational proportionate military reason,butthat US military and intelligence analysis is clear that these are in fact militarily counter-productive acts of gratuitous mass-murder,thenby any reasonable definition these must be acts of genocide. The logic is simple and inescapable. I have written lengthy pieces showing in detail that these were large scale systematic and intentional genocides which you can read.1
For a long time I have tried to think of ways to condense this in a readable form. The problem in many respects lies with the necessity of overcoming misapprehensions. Genocide is an emotive topic; people are very reluctant to read that those who rule in their name (with whom they sometimes actively identify) are in the moral vicinity of the Nazi leaders of Germany. Permeating every level of the discourse is the constant position (whether as the unspoken assumption or as the active assertion) that the US has never acted with genocidal intent. Intentionality is a topic in its own right, but to be brief I will point out that intent does not require that “genocide” be its own motive. If I kill someone because I want their watch, I can’t turn around and say it isn’t murder because I didn’t intend to kill them because I was really just intending to take their watch. It may seem a ridiculous example, but the discourse of genocide is so twisted that it is the norm even amongst genocide scholars. Primed by our political leaders and various media, we keep looking for the people, the bloodthirsty psychopathic monsters, who kill people just for the fun of it and grab their watch afterwards as an afterthought. Unsurprisingly, most Westerners find those people among the leaders of those countries who oppose Western political power. Now our leaders are trying to persuade us that that includes Syria’s Bashar al-Assad (though many are becoming skeptical of this “Hitler-of-the-month” propaganda).
The best way of demonstrating US intentionality is to demonstrate the consistency of their approach in different times and places. However, this is a necessarily exhaustive approach, so I have decided to take a different tack here. I wish to sketch a fragment of autobiography here – an outline of the process by which I came to my current understanding of the topic. I didn’t seek these conclusions out, but had it made clear to me, by rather comfortably embedded scholars, that they think that I am being provocative out of ambition. It is a testament to the self-satisfaction of such people that they somehow think that being provocative is some advantage. Academia thrives on the journal-filling peer-reviewed “controversies” of rival schools and scholars, but they aren’t really keen on anything that might actually be of any interest to anyone else. The fact is that I didn’t seek this out and it certainly has not endeared me to anyone that I can think of. On the other hand, I have had people act as if I had smeared my own faeces all over myself for using the g-word with respect to Iraq, and I have had many metaphorical doors slammed in my face. As I hope the following will indicate, at least partially, I cannot but characterise US genocides as such and I cannot but view the subject of absolute urgent fundamental importance.
The Vietnam War loomed large in my childhood. I was five when it ended. I watched the critical documentary seriesVietnam: The 10,000 Day Warwhen I was ten or eleven years old. During the 1980s Vietnam War movie craze I was sucked into that powerful quagmire of pathos and adrenaline – not to mention the evocative music. But even then, as a teen, I could not abide the apologism and the way in which American lives and American suffering were privileged. The US personnel were portrayed as the victims, even in films which showed US atrocities. I knew far too much about things such as the nature of the atrocities carried out by the Contras to find that sort of propaganda palatable. For one thing, I had read William Blum’sThe CIA: A Forgotten History. This book (now titledKilling Hope) doesn’t leave the reader much room for illusions about the US role in international politics. Perhaps if I had been a little older I might have been “educated” enough to be blind to the obvious, but I wasn’t. While most people managed to avoid facing the facts, I knew from this book and others like it that although the atrocities of the Soviet Bloc were substantial, they were dwarfed by those of the US and its closest clients. If Cuba, for example, has been repressive, then what words remain to describe the US installed regimes in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, El Salvador, or Chile?
How could one characterise a state that backed and created death squad regimes that massacred entire villages, that tortured children to death in front of parents? How does one describe a militarised country whose meticulously planned and executed bombing raids systematically visited untold death and suffering on innocents as an intended purpose. Any informed person who had an objective proportionate viewpoint could only conclude, as Martin Luther King Jr. had alreadyconcluded, that the US government and the wider US corporate state were “the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.” Fred Branfman, who saw the results of US bombing first-hand in Laos, has morerecently concludedthat the executive branch of the US government is “the world’s most evil and lawless institution.”
On moral terms I could not have been more condemnatory of the US government. I considered the US government and military-corporate-intelligence complex to be the worst thing in the world since the demise of the Third Reich. I believed this on the basis that they had demonstrably brought about more suffering, death and destruction than anyone else. If someone had tried to claim that it was for “freedom,” I would have laughed bitterly, thinking of the brutally crushed democracies and popular movements that were victims of the US. But if someone had said to me that the US had committed genocide in Korea and Indochina I would have most likely dismissed the claim as emotive overstatement. I didn’t actually know what the word genocide meant precisely, but I would still have seen its use as being a form of exaggeration. Implicitly, I took the word “genocide” to be a form of subjective moral condemnation, as if it were an inchoate scream rather than a word that might have a consistent meaning. (You can’t exaggerate by calling something “arson,” for example. It is either a lie or it is the truth. Genocide is the same). However, “genocide,” as a word, has been subjected to the ideological processes (described so well by Orwell inNineteen Eighty-Four) which destroy the meaning of words. Here is how I put it in an academicpiece:
Certain words are so highly politicised in their usage that, in Orwellian fashion, they are stripped of all meaning and become merely signals designed to provoke in impassioned unreasoning involuntary response. In this fashion ‘democracy’means ‘double-plus good’ and the Party members2respond with cheers and tears of joy. Equally, ‘terrorism’ means ‘double-plus bad’ provoking among Party members, ‘[a] hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, totorture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer….’3Genocide plays a starring role in an entire discourse shaped in such a way as to not only excuse but to facilitate the perpetration of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Stripped of any actual meaning but given the significance of being the ‘ultimate crime’ it becomes a tool by which powerful Western states are able to threaten or carry out attacks against weaker states – attacks which are in themselves criminal andwhich in some instances are actually genocidal. The emotive misuse of the term genocide has become a powerful political tool. As Jeremy Scahill reveals after accusations of genocide by Arabs against black Africans, “even at antiwar rallies, scores of protesters held signs reading, ‘Out of Iraq, into Darfur.’” Scahill adds that, ‘[a] quick survey of Sudan’s vast natural resources dispels any notion that U. S./corporate desires to move into Sudan derive from purely humanitarian motives.’4
What brought me around to using the term genocide was realising that there was no other word to describe what the US did in South Viet Nam. I had been aware that the vast majority of victims of the US military were civilians. It was commonplace to say that 90% of casualties were civilian. (Tellingly Western commentators, including those in the peace movement, would vouch that the figure of 90% civilian casualties was proof of how cruel and deadly “modern war” had become – as if US practices were some sort of universal standard and as if the fact that other belligerents did not produce such high rates of civilian death was not of any interest whatsoever.)
So, US violence mostly caused civilian deaths and the vast majority of those civilians were, in fact, subjects of the US installed puppet [sic] regime in Saigon. They were killing their own supposed allies. I have read all of the rationalisations for why the US thought it was a good idea to kill the civilians of their own client state, and they are all completely insane. I don’t even believe that killing the civilian populations ofenemycountries is militarily effective, and in that belief I am supported by the strategic analyses of the US itself going back to 1944. Killing the civilian population of an allied state makesno military sense whatsoever. Often killing civilians was rationalised in terms of counterinsurgency (usually crudely reversing Maoist doctrine about the relationship between the guerrilla and the rural population) despite the fact that it was recognised from very early on that the civilian deaths were recruiting and strengthening the enemy.
That was the other striking thing about US activities in Indochina – they were systematically killing civilians without apparent purpose, but they were also undermining their own political and military efforts. This happened at all levels. As I was reading and coming to grips with this aspect of history, it seemed that exactly the same thing was playing out in Iraq. In 2003, as invasion loomed, I had initially expected that the US would conduct a fast vicious campaign particularly aimed at inflicting maximum damage to economic infrastructure. They would then leave, crowing about their surgical use of force and minuscule US fatalities. The US would continue to enhance the perceived legitimacy of its acts of aggression and would be able to use economic blackmail to exert neocolonial control. However, I was woefully nave for believing that. In contrast, Paul Wolfowitz wasabsolutely clearon this point – you cannot use normal neocolonial power on Iraq: “…[W]e just had no choice in Iraq. The country swims on a sea of oil.” Instead, the US invaded, occupied and then acted repeatedly and systematically in ways which would very predictably cause armed resistance, just as they had in Indochina. But without that resistance they could not have justified a major military presence and the proconsular rule of the occupation imposed on Iraq.
In 2006 I was able to devote quite a lot of time to the subject of genocide in Indochina as it was the topic of my Honoursresearchpaper. My initial understanding of genocide was pretty thin and one-dimensional, but it was sound in the given context. The most important aspect for me was that genocide matchedmeanswithends. War is always a matter of uncertain outcome. To wage war is to wager (the words are cognates). Indeed that is why we use such terms as “wage” and “adventure” for military action. Carl von Clausewitz wrote that a belligerent will never be able to attain their intended war aims because the war they pursue will itself change matters and impose its own realities. In that sense, war is a gamble which will always be lost. Genocide isnota gamble.
Genocide was an attack on the peoples of Indochina which avoided the uncertainties of waging military war. The maximal aim of the genocide was the eventual neocolonial domination of Indochina. It worked. In Viet Nam the war and subsequent US economic sanctions were devastating. By 1990 the per capita GDP was only $114.5Underdoi moiliberalisation, Viet Nam has achieved much greater formal economic activity (GDP), but only by submitting to the Washington Consensus, which means no price supports for staples such as rice, which in turn means that the real income of the poorest urban dwellers has dropped.6Genocide doesn’t need an end goal such as such as submitting to neoliberal WTO regulations and IMF conditions. Chomsky called Vietnamese poverty “a vivid refutation of the claim that the US lost.”7Similar stories could be related with regard to Laos and Cambodia. Whether these nation states are considered enemies or vanquished vassals or friends is of no relevance, the weakness of their populations is a gain in relative power for the US empire, and empires intrinsically function on relative gains.
This is what I wrote in 2006:
…[A]clever strategist, where possible, matches means and ends, thus making results more predictable. In a situation where there is a stated end and a given means are employed and continue to be employed despite continued demonstrable “failure” and are then employed elsewhere under the same rationale with the same results – in such a situation it is possibly worth considering that the “means” are themselves the end. In the case of the Second Indochina War, I will argue the means were widespread general destruction, employed on as many of the people and as much of the societal fabric or infrastructure as was physically and politically feasible. If those were the means, I will suggest, they were also the end. The results are predictable. The dead stay dead.
When Raphel Lemkin first coined the word “genocide,” hewrote“genocide is a new technique of occupation aimed at winning the peace even though the war itself is lost.” He also wrote: “Genocide is the antithesis of the … doctrine [which] holds that war is directed against sovereigns and armies, not against subjects and civilians. In its modern application in civilized society, the doctrine means that war is conducted against states and armed forces and not against populations. … [T]he Germans prepared, waged, and continued a war not merely against states and their armies but against peoples. For the German occupying authorities war thus appears to offer the most appropriate occasion for carrying out their policy of genocide.”
The US was maintaining the “war.” It helped to recruit its enemies, to arm them, finance them, and to supply them. Just as I was researching this,Endless War?by David Keen was published about the War on Terror which claimed that it was a self-perpetuating endless “war system”. It focused on clearly “counterproductive” actions undertaken by the US, belying its stated aims:
When it comes to war in other words, winning is not everything; it may be the taking part that counts. Indeed, as Orwell saw in his novelNineteen Eighty-Four, certain kinds of regimes may thrive off energies and perpetual war. The irrationality of counterproductive tactics, in short, may be more apparent than real, and even an endless war may not be endless in the sense of lacking aims or functions.8
Keen never mentioned Indochina. The precedents he cited of were civil wars in Africa. However it was as if the idea of a war system was, in a sense, on the tip of people’s tongues towards the end of the US involevment in Indochina, as if they knew deep-down that the US was not trying to win the war. It seems almost the implicit subtext of Magnum photographer Philip Jones Griffiths’ book,Vietnam Inc., which by its title alone suggests an enterprise quite differently conceived than war. Even the orthodox political discourse (with talk of quagmires and a “stab in the back” story of brave soldiers hamstrung by politicians) hints at a war system. What the US did in Indochina was an absolute textbook example of what Keen was describing.
From this way of understanding the past, I was also viewing events in Iraq with the same apprehension. What was occurring on a daily basis was very clearly indicating a parallel process. Captured weapons were dumped unsecured in the countryside. Efforts to secure borders (to at least impede the flow of weapons, resistance fighters and money) were systematically undermined. Just as in Viet Nam, diverted cash sloshed through networks of corruption and was available to resistance groups. People were driven into the arms of the resistance by the random brutality of US personnel, the murderous use of indiscriminate ordnance, and the systematic degradation of the civilian economic sphere. On top of this, the US fomented a civil war.
It is a pity that Keen did not know of the Indochina precedent because what we know of it goes much deeper and reaches much higher than the what we know of the “War on Terror” (which Keen takes to include Iraq and Afghanistan interventions). Keen discusses various tactics and policies which are counterproductive. But it is not just the counterproductive things which sustain US enemies, it is the ways in which US leaders ensure that they cannot ever achieve a victory. This is what I wrote:
Numerous people, including Jeffrey Record9and Harry Summers10have in effect suggested that the US lacked any winning strategy. In fact, what they had were three no-win strategies – strategies which did not, even in theory, have an end point at which a military victory would be obtained. These were the fire-power/attrition, the graduated response and the enclave strategies. The only strategy by which the US could have attained its stated objective was the pacification strategy, but this too was no threat because the pacification strategy was only weakly implemented while being misapplied, subverted, sabotaged and contravened – not least by the more vigorous application of the fire-power/attrition and graduated response strategies.
You can read all about thatstuffin detail if you want, otherwise you’ll just have to take my word for it. The US systematically ensured that it could never achieve “victory” in Indochina. Perhaps the most blatant example was the brutal genocide unleashed on Cambodia from 1970 until 1975. Not the “genocide” or “autogenocide” of the Khmer Rouge, but the genocide before that, without which there would never have been a Khmer Rouge takeover. Here’s a long excerpt from my Honours piece:
When the the US generated a war in Cambodia they had already had a great deal of experience in Viet Nam and Laos, and what occurred in Cambodia is, in many ways, a naked exposure of the logic behind the genocidal war system, less obfuscated because, ironically, Cambodia was a “sideshow” where it was not the details but the whole war which was kept obscure from the public.
Within a year of Lon Nol’s coup, as mentioned, the economy of Cambodia was virtually destroyed, not only by bombing, but also by US aid. Aid was channelled to the import of commodities and surplus US agricultural goods. It also underwrote the Cambodian government and armed forces: “By the end of 1970, the government was spending five times its revenue and earning nothing abroad.”11Most of the population became reliant on US aid to eat, and rice supplies were kept at the minimum level needed to prevent food riots. By 1975, malnutrition was widespread and many children starved to death.12
Less than two months after the coup that brought Lon Nol to power, the US invaded Cambodia, along with ARVN forces. They did not bother to forewarn Lon Nol who found out after Richard Nixon had announced the invasion publicly.13This invasion along US and RVN bombing and the civil war made refugees of around half of the Cambodian population.14Lon Nol was outraged by the invasion and when later briefed by Alexander Haig (then military assistant to Kissinger) about US intentions he wept with frustration. According to Shawcross, “He wished that the Americans had blocked the communists’ escape route before attacking, instead of spreading them across Cambodia. … The Cambodian leader told Haig that there was no way his small force could stop them. … [Haig] informed Lon Nol that President Nixon intended to limit the involvement of American forces…. They would be withdrawn at the end of June. The the President hoped to introduce a program of restricted military and economic aid. As the implications of Haig’s words for the future of Cambodia became clear to Lon Nol, he began to weep. Cambodia, he said, could never defend itself.”15
As has been detailed, US actions, particularly in bombing, were directly responsible for creating the communist enemy which overthrew Lon Nol. The bombing between 1969 and 1973 took up to 150,000 lives.16If averaged out, over 33 tons of ordnance were used to kill each Khmer Rouge insurgent.17Despite the fact that Vietnamese pilots bombed any Cambodian they could, which aided only the Khmer Rouge, Lon Nol acceded to a US demand that he request an increase in VNAF bombing in 1971.18
By May 1972, the Lon Nol regime had control of perhaps 10 per cent of the country and continued to lose territory which was thereafter fragmented into ever smaller enclaves.19The result was by that stage foregone, and yet the war dragged on for three years with the greater part of the 1 million casualties occurring after that point.
In 1970, when Henry Kissinger briefed Jonathan “Fred” Ladd, who was slated to conduct the war in Cambodia, he told him: “Don’t even think of victory; just keep it alive.”20
When the US Congress finally blocked aid to Cambodia and South Viet Nam, it was with the belated realisation that such aid would not give any hope of victory or improve a bargaining position. Senator Mike Mansfield spoke out, “Ultimately Cambodia cannot survive…. Additional aid means more killing, more fighting. This has got to stop sometime.”21
It was pretty clear that the US was maintaining the situation of armed conflict in order to commit genocide. This was a comprehensive act of genocide which did not merely involve the systematic killing of the target populations, it also involved every other “technique of genocide” described by Lemkin. There was systematic economic, social, cultural, political, and religious destruction. There was the systematic and deliberate ecocidal poisoning of the land and people with defoliants. There was very raw brutality. People were slaughtered by bombs, but there was also murder, rape and torture on a scale beyond imagining. In one book co-written by Nick Turse he finds that when he sets out to find the site of a massacre in Vietnam it becomes like trying to find a needle in a haystack of massacre sites.22In his next bookKill Anything that MovesTurse tries to show that haystack for what it is. The results would be hard to believe if they were not so well documented. I cannot reduce its contents here, I can only recommend that people acquire and read the book. It is a litany of slaughter that seems almost endless and through it all the command structure and the political structure provide the framework for the personnel to commit atrocities.
This is not just about the choice of tactics – it is also about “grand tactics”, strategy, doctrine, and indoctrination. Psychiatrist and author Robert Jay Lifton famously discussed “atrocity producing situations” as a driving factor behind US war crimes, and I believe we can now conclude these situations were deliberately created, not just because we have other evidence that atrocities were tacitly encouraged, but because the US went to great lengths to replicate these these “atrocity producing situations” in Iraq.
Why Genocide and Not War?
By the end of my honours thesis I was convinced that both the second Indochina War and the “Iraq War” were “genocidal war systems”. Since then I have learnt a great deal more, and my thinking has developed a great deal more. I won’t bore you with the detail, but I came to realise the the “war system” appellation was largely redundant. Genocides are “war systems” by nature. Almost every perpetrator of genocide explains their violence as fighting war.
Genocide was a key means by which the US secured global hegemony in the post-WWII era. I learnt that Korea was also a case of US genocide. US actions there were as shocking, as deadly and as militarily nonsensical as they were in Indochina. Hundreds of thousands were massacred and hundreds of thousands incinerated. 25% of the entire population of North Korea was killed and we should not forget that many hundreds of thousands of the ostensibly allied South Koreans died at US hands or those of US commanded troops. The whole war became widely recognised as a pointless killing machine (described as “the meatgrinder”) while the US needlessly sabotaged and prolonged armistice negotiations.
I can’t explain in this space why Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq posed such great threats to US imperial hegemony, but they did, and the US successfully dealt with those dangers by committing genocide. These are successful uses of genocide to establish, deepen, and maintain imperialist hegemony, but we have wilfully blinded ourselves to their nature. Critics of US interventions have evidently been scared to entertain the notion that there was some successfully applied rationale to US behaviour. They have joined with the lovers of war, the nationalists, the racists and the fanatics in declaring over and over and over again the wrong-headedness and failures of US military endeavours. The victims of US genocide quite understandably prefer to see themselves as the plucky Davids that beat the Pentagon Goliath. These are all lies.
US forces storm into one house after another, claiming to be trying to kill flies with sledgehammers. Given that they have entirely demolished several houses and severely damaged many others; and given that they have been caught red-handed releasing flies into targeted houses; and given that they forcibly try to make people buy very expensive fly “insurance”; maybe it is time we consider that neither they, nor their sledgehammers, are concerned in any way with flies (except as a pretext).
Where people might once have been terrified that to suggest any cogent purpose to US actions for fear of giving credit to warmongers, we need not be so worried now. It is very clear that the US does not exert imperialist hegemony for the sake of peace and stability or even for the sake of the enrichment of the US and its people. They never protected us from the nefarious existential evil threat of communism and they don’t protect us from the nefarious existential evil threat of Islam. A very narrow group of imperialists who share a cohesive long-term hegemonic programme have successfully concentrated power and wealth levels of disparity akin to those in slavery-based economies. They have also created a neofeudal framework of privatised regnal rights. No doubt many of these people have noble intentions, believing that only by such ruthless action can they exert enough control to save humanity from its self-destructive impulses. Many elitists will openly express such opinions and we can certainly understand having concern over the future of the planet. But such people are, in fact, completely insane and they should be taken out of circulation and treated exactly like any other dangerous megalomaniac who believes that they are the new Napoleon. It is not the masses that are threatening the planet. It is not the masses who bring about wars. And though communal violence seems almost the epitome of the mob in action, I know of no genocide that did not result from the actions of a narrow elite.
The reason that we must view US genocides as being genocides and not wars is that we cannot ever understand the logic of their actions in any other way. People shy away from the term genocide and people react violently to what they perceive as its misuse. That indicates just how important it is. I mentioned Nick Turse’sKill Anything that Moveswhich is an entire book devoted primarily to the systematic killing of non-combatants. He never uses the term “genocide”. In a work based on veteran testimony, Chris Hedges and Laila al-Arian explain that the very nature of the Iraq occupation is that of an atrocity producing situation and that US personnel have gone “from killing – the shooting of someone who [can] harm you – to murder. The war in Iraq is primarily about murder. There is very little killing.”23They are talking about the systematic murder of civilians in small increments multiplied many times over, but they never use the term “genocide”. This despite the fact that US actions in Indochina have widely been adjudged genocidal and despite the fact that it was very strongly argued that the US and UK controlled sanctions against Iraq were genocidal. Ask yourself this: if someone was documenting the same thing being perpetrated by Sudan, or by Zimbabwe do you think the word “genocide” would be left out of such works?
Above all we must end the continuing fatuous nonsense spouted by security geeks (including high ranking military and civilian personnel) who seem to believe every exaggerated claim about threats from the Cubans, the Iranians, the Soviets, Al Qaeda in the Falklands (AQIF) or whomever. The morons with their clichés about “fighting the last war” will never ever tire of telling us how the US just doesn’t know how to do counterinsurgency. Really? The question must be, then how did they manage to remain so bad at counterinsurgency when they have spent more person hours on counterinsurgency and counter-guerilla warfare that all other states throughout the entirety of humanity added together? (I could list a few examples here starting with the “Indian” Wars, mentioning 200 years of interventions in the Western hemisphere, Cuba, Philippines, Pacific War, Korea and Indochina. Then there is also the institutional knowledge built and disseminated by “security co-operation”. Moreover, the US is trains many of the rest of the world’s military leaders to conduct counterinsurgency atFort Benning.)
The point is that you can’t understand what the US does through the lens of war. It is very satisfying, no doubt, for young liberal reporters to outsmart generals (who clearly have no idea how to fight wars because they are just stupid Republicans), but it is seriously delusional. There is an instant exculpation given when these genocides are misrepresented as wars. It is very, very important for perpetrators of aggression or genocide (or both) to conceal their intentionality. The UK government and Tony Blair, in particular, showed far more concern with convincing people that they themselves believed in their fictitiouscasus belli, than with convincing people that Iraq really did have pose a threat. All of the British media seemed to echo the mantra that you might not agree with Blair but, “no one can doubt his sincerity”. So for moral reasons, in order to end the impunity of the worlds worst war criminals, as well as for intellectual reasons we must grasp the nettle and begin using the term genocide.
There are many problematic areas in the subject of genocide. Sometimes it is hard to tell when war ends and genocide begins. It can be hard to tell where state repression becomes persecution and when persecution becomes genocide. Were not the Nuremburg Laws an epitome of what we now call apartheid? Is apartheid a form of slow genocide? Is there structural genocide? Should something only be called genocide if there are mass fatalities?
These are all important considerations and questions, but none of them are relevant here. The genocides I have referenced are absolute textbook cases of genocide. It is impossible to create a coherent and rational definition of the term “genocide” which does not include these genocides.
These genocides weremoredemonstrably genocidal in nature than the Armenian Holocaust. We should always remember that for the Turkish government, and for most Turks, there was no such thing as a genocide of Armenians. In their own eyes they were fighting a war against Armenian insurgents. Sound familiar?",1

Caitriona Balfe, Monaghan born, has been ranked among top US TV earners. She appears on the screen as the most demanding actress as appears in top TV show Outlander and very widely seen Game of Thrones and Modern Family.
The US people like her in each role she does because she moulds her spirit according to the role that place in the hearts of the audience.
A well-known magazine entitled Variety reports that she earns $100,000 per episode of Outlander for playing a role of time-traveling Claire Fraser.
It would be interesting to found that five stars of Game of Thrones are among the top 10 earners of Television Industry in the United States which are Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Lena Headey, and Peter Dinklage each earns $500,000 from HBO juggernauts per episode.
Among the top ten earners, Kevin Spacey is another most seen face in United States who take half a million for playing a role in House of Cards by power obsessed Frank Underwood and more interestingly, his co-star is nowhere in the ride of top rankers in the list. Keep visiting us for further leading stories and stay tuned.

"The Saybrook Breakwater Lighthouse is a Connecticut icon. Built in 1886, it sits at the mouth of the Connecticut River, in the exclusive Fenwick section of Old Saybrook. Since 1993, its “sparkplug” design has adorned the state’s “Preserve the Sound” license plates.
But for thefirst 131 years of its existence, the cast-iron and brick Breakwater Light has had a reputation for hardship. Life was “cold, damp, and uncomfortable at the station for the keepers,”according to a local enthusiast site. “Going to shore for supplies in the 12-foot rowboat required a hazardous journey fighting the Connecticut River’s strong currents. A walk to shore along the half-mile-long breakwater was dangerous as well, and even impossible after ice built up on it in the winter.”
Soon, though, the lighthousewill begin a metamorphosis that’s been decades in the making. Frank Sciame, the construction magnate whose eponymous company has worked on ambitious New York City projects such as the New Museum for Contemporary Art, the High Line, and the Harvard Club, has been a co-owner of the lighthouse since 2015. This week, he solidified his control over the 49-foot tower and plans this fall to begin turning it into a guesthouse for his children and grandchildren.
“Historic structures are of real interest to me,” said Sciame, the former chairman of the New York Landmarks Conservancy. He added that he’d been looking at the lighthouse throughout the 20 years he’s spent on Fenwick, the last decade from the former estate of Katharine Hepburn, at10 Mohegan Avenue. “When it came on the market, I had to have it.”
And now that he’s got it, he’s going to fix it up on his own, he said, as a “hobby,” with the advice of restoration experts and the aid of his family. “I’ll have the young guys help me,” he said.
First on his list is restoring the exterior, which has been through a serious beating over the course of its history. In 1938, the lighthouse barely survived a hurricane. “Everything swept away by the hurricane except the tower,” wrote its keeper at the time, Sidney Gross.
“There are a couple of cracks in the masonry and in the cast-iron shell that we will be restoring and repairing,” Sciame said, adding that he’ll source the cast iron from the same resource in Alabama he used when restoring the artist Donald Judd’s SoHo loft. “We’ll paint it, put in new windows. Make sure it’s watertight.”
Sciame intends to install a generator and solar panels, with shipbuilding as his inspiration. (At one point, he engaged the yacht designers Persak & Wurmfeld to draw up plans for the transformation.) “It’ll be totally self-sufficient,” he said.
Inside, Sciame plans to create an entrance lobby, put an owner’s stateroom on the second floor, fill the third floor with bunk beds for his grandchildren, and on the fourth floor build a salon “with a stair to a little indoor bar that connects to the wraparound 5-foot-wide walkway.” He said the design of the exterior would remain traditional, with the interior being more contemporary. “Honestly, that might change,” he acknowledged.
It might change—and it might take a while. “Finally a project without a budget or a deadline!” he crowed. “I’m not gonna rush.”
Nothing about the lighthouse’s recent history has been rushed. In 2008the National Park Service began trying to transfer control of 12 “excess” lighthouses away from the federal government and, ideally, to nonprofit, educational, or cultural agencies. For various reasons—logistical, bureaucratic, political—this didn’t happen, and by2015, Sciame had the chance to acquire it through a General Services Administration auction.
But a friend of his wanted it, too. “We didn’t want two guys bidding against each other, so we went partners on it,” Sciame explained. They won the auction with a $290,000 bid.
In the two years since, again due to what Sciame described as “red tape,” they haven’t done any work on the structure. Then, five months ago, Sciame’s partner put his own Fenwick property—a $10.4 million compound connected to the breakwater, and thus to the lighthouse—on the market. “Imagine the life of a Lighthouse Keeper!” read the listing.
The compound included two parcels of land, one with an 8,000-square-foot, five-bedroom house, the other a 2,643-square-foot three-bedroom. Both are colonial-style, with red-cedar shingles that have a well-aged look, even though they were built in 2006. They were available to be purchased separately, for $7.4 million and $3.5 million, or together for $10.4 million.
As it happened, it was Sciame himself who this week went into contract on the larger house, with an option on the smaller as well. Last week, he sold the Hepburn estate, which had been on the market since March.
If any of this saga has you lusting for a lighthouse of your own, well, the GSA has five up for auction right now. They may not be as iconic as Saybrook’s, but they are not as expensive either: The highest price listed is $31,000.
The Coast Guard, meanwhile, will maintain the Saybrook light, which continues to run at night, and the foghorn. “If it’s foggy, the horn will go off,” said Sciame. “I guess you’re not gonna sleep too well!”",0
"After the state of Ohio found that voting machines in more than a dozen counties had been tampered with, they tied them directly to the George Soros Corporation. It took the Federal Election Commission less than an hour to get an indictment through the US Attorney after that.
In under three hours total, George Soros was photographed sitting in a courtroom waiting to be arraigned.
Soros faces charges of election tampering, wire fraud, electronics fraud and perjury — as well as several smaller charges of inciting violence and harassment — after accounting books found in his office prove he personally paid the Berkely protestors as well as the group of liberal trolls that “goated” 26 conservative Facebook pages in 2014.
If convicted, Soros could face 30 years in prison and fines up to $40 million.
He also runs the risk of having his citizenship revoked and being deported to his home country of Hungary. He was released on $10 million bail.
The prosecutor said this is just the beginning of the case against Soros and that it could go right up the rungs of the democratic party, possibly all the way to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
The investigation is ongoing, but he says there is plenty of evidence to try and convict Soros on the charges he already faces.

"TRENTON, N. J. — Top U.S. drug wholesaler McKesson agreed Wednesday to create an independent board chairman, responding to a Teamsters-led shareholder protest over its role in distributing opioids.
McKesson Corp. is dealing with lawsuits, government investigations and fines for its handling of suspicious opioid orders to U. S. communities. Wholesalers buy drugs from manufacturers and sell them to pharmacies, hospitals and nursing homes.
The company's move came even though shareholders at Wednesday's meeting didn't back the Teamsters' proposal to split the CEO and board chairman jobs to provide more oversight and protect the company's reputation. The change won't take effect until after longtime CEO John Hammergren leaves.
The union, a longtime McKesson shareholder, also opposed the company's executive pay package. In an advisory vote, shareholders rejected it; the company said it will review its compensation policies and consider changes.
""These reforms will not bring back the lives taken by the opioid crisis, but hopefully will provide greater oversight and accountability for how prescription drugs are distributed in this country,"" Teamsters General Secretary Ken Hall said in a statement.
Union members protested before the start of the annual shareholders meeting in Irving, Texas.
Last January, San Francisco-based McKesson agreed to pay a record $150 million settlement with the Justice Department over allegations it violated the Controlled Substances Act by not reporting frequent or suspiciously large shipments of opioids. That was required under the company's $13.25 million settlement with the government in 2008 over similar allegations.
The January settlement also required McKesson to stop sales of controlled substances from four warehouses.
McKesson is being sued by West Virginia's attorney general, accused of oversupplying opioids in that state, and also by the Cherokee Nation for allegedly using deceptive practices. Also, a House committee is investigating the role of McKesson and two other large wholesalers in growing opioid shipments.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, treasurers of three states hit hard by opioid abuse — West Virginia, Illinois and Pennsylvania — sent McKesson a letter urging the company to take steps to stem the opioid epidemic.
""The company is doing everything it can to help address this crisis in close partnership with the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration and other organizations,"" McKesson said in a statement after Wednesday's meeting.
The Teamsters' shareholder proposal was backed by Institutional Shareholder Services, the world's biggest advisory service on corporate governance issues, whose clients include large pension and hedge funds. The group noted McKesson's ""poor share performance"" and the repeated top executive bonuses above set targets despite the opioid controversy.
According to the group's calculations, McKesson gave Hammergren a total of $21.7 million in compensation for the 2017 fiscal year. Hammergren, 58, has been McKesson's chief executive since 2001 and board chairman since 2002.
McKesson shares have fallen more than 30 percent from a peak of about $237 in May 2015.",0
"Hollywood has suffered another hack — and this one may have targeted ""Game of Thrones"" and other HBO shows.
Richard Plepler, HBO's chairman and CEO, notified employees of the breach in a Monday morning email.
“As most of you have probably heard by now, there has been a cyber incident directed at the company which has resulted in some stolen proprietary information, including some of our programming,” he wrote.
“Any intrusion of this nature is obviously disruptive, unsettling, and disturbing for all of us. I can assure you that senior leadership and our extraordinary technology team, along with outside experts, are working round the clock to protect our collective interests.""
The network isn't commenting on the scope of the breach or the specifics of what was stolen
""HBO recently experienced a cyber incident, which resulted in the compromise of proprietary information. We immediately began investigating the incident and are working with law enforcement and outside cyber security firms. Data protection is a top priority at HBO, and we take seriously our responsibility to protect the data we hold,"" HBO said in a statement.
Material that has yet to air from ""Ballers"" and ""Room 104"" has apparently been leaked online, according to reports. In addition, hackers may have taken written material allegedly from an upcoming episode of ""Game of Thrones,"" according to Entertainment Weekly. In total, EW reports hackers claim to have 1.5 terabyte of data. For some perspective, 1 TB can hold an estimated 500 hours worth of movies, according to a ballpark estimate from PC Ninja.
NBC News has not been able to independently verify these claims.
It's unclear who is behind the attack, however an anonymous email reportedly addressed to several reporters made them aware of the breach on Sunday.
“Hi to all mankind. The greatest leak of cyber space era is happening. What’s its name? Oh I forget to tell. Its HBO and Game of Thrones……!!!!!! You are lucky to be the first pioneers to witness and download the leak. Enjoy it & spread the words. Whoever spreads well, we will have an interview with him. HBO is falling,"" according to EW.
Plepler also said in his email that the ""problem before us is unfortunately all too familiar in the world we now find ourselves a part of. As has been the case with any challenge we have ever faced, I have absolutely no doubt that we will navigate our way through this successfully.""
HBO joins the ranks of other Hollywood giants that have been under attack in recent years.
Netflix fell victim to hackers earlier this year when some episodes of ""Orange Is the New Black"" season five were leaked prior to the series' June release date.
As far as entertainment industry hacks go, Sony suffered the biggest one yet in 2014 when thieves leaked personal information and email exchanges, some of which were between actors and executives. The hack was apparently prompted by the satirical film ""The Interview,"" in which a news crew scores an interview with Kim Jong Un — and is asked by the CIA to assassinate him.
However, it's also worth a note of caution. Hackers are usually a braggadocios bunch who like to overstate their claims. Earlier this year, Disney was the target of a hoax, in which hackers claimed to have a copy of the newest ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film in their possession.",0
"According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report on the torture program, the CIA’s torture of detainees was developed by two inexperienced contractors who were paid $81 million for their work.
RT reports:..two contractors in particular – codenamed ‘Swigert’ and ‘Dunbar’ – played a pivotal role in advising the CIA as the agency sought tactics to interrogate suspected terrorists in the wake of 9/11. Reports published as far back as almost a decade ago identify those men as James Elmer Mitchell and Bruce Jessen – two psychologists who made bank by designing the torture program and to this day remain on Uncle Sam’s payroll.
In all, the Senate report suggests that the two contractors who created the torture program were paid more than $80 million in taxpayer money for their work with the CIA. The government has agreed to cover upwards of $5 million in additional indemnity costs for the two men if they incur legal costs for their role as interrogation program architects through 2021, and the executive summary released on Tuesday after nearly four years of work suggests the pair has already received $1.1 million due to legal fees largely involving the creation of the Senate Committee’s report.
Those men, the Senate Intelligence Committee said this week, were the “sole source contract to provide operational psychologists, debriefers and security personnel at CIA detention sites.”
In 2002, the CIA sent ‘Swigert’ to an unnamed country, according to the report, where he would initially “consult on the psychological aspects” of the planned interrogation of Abu Zubaydah – a Palestinian man captured that March in Pakistan as an enemy combatant.
Within a month of Zubaydah being captured, CIA headquarters had decided that the detainee would be interrogated by what the Senate report described as “the most coercive option” available to the government: a regiment designed by Swigert but opposed by the FBI.
The tactics proposed by Swigert, according to the report, included cramped confinement, wall standing, stress positions, sleep deprivation, waterboarding, forcing detainees to wear diapers, and what the Senate called “mock burial.” Swigert had come up with those suggestions and others along with ‘Dunbar,’ and told the CIA that the men should be contracted together to aid with interrogations.
Both Swigert and Dunbar lacked previous involvement in any real-world interrogations, the Senate Committee found, and had proposed a policy of torture developed decades earlier by the US based on resisting torture tactics that the North Vietnamese might have used against American troops. Regardless of their inexperience and their insistence on using crude techniques intended to sometimes bring detainees close to death, however, the government gave both contractors millions of dollars over the course of several years to oversee the program they orchestrated under then-President George W. Bush.
“Neither psychologist had experience as an interrogator, nor did either have specialized knowledge of Al-Qaeda, a background in terrorism or any relevant regional, cultural or linguistic expertise,” the Senate report reads.
Nevertheless, the contractors “implicitly proposed continued use of the technique – at a daily compensation reported to be $1800/day, or four times that of interrogators who could not use the technique,” the Senate found.",1
"Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Valeant's projection on full-year 2016 revenue. It is $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion.
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International posted lower second-quarter revenue and a worsening loss but itsstock jumpedafter the embattledcompany's new CEO signaled plans to retool.
The Montreal-based company's shares rose $5.71, or 25%, to close Tuesdayat $28.16.
Revenue fell 11.4% to $2.42 billion for the quarter, missing S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst estimates of $2.45 billion.
The company'sloss similarlywidened to $302 million from $53 million a year ago, missing estimates of $261 million.
The results came just over a year afterValeant's shares peaked at $262.52, before starting a plunge that erased roughly 90% of their value. The slide came amidmultipleinvestigationsof the company's drug pricing and marketing practices, as well as allegations about Valeant's since-cancelled distribution deal with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services.
Valeant shares (VRX) surgedafter CEO Joseph Papa issued a statementannouncing ""a new strategic direction"" that ""at its hearthas a mission to improve patients' lives and will involve reorganizing our company and reporting segments.""
""Although it will take time to implement and execute our turnaround plan, I am confident that we will show progress in the coming quarters,"" said Papa, who succeeded former CEO J. Michael Pearson in May.
Valeant reaffirmed its full-year guidance after a series of earlier cuts. The company projected2016 adjustedearnings per share of $6.60 to $7, and total revenue of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion. If met, the projections would keep the company from violating its debt covenants.
The companyalso saidthat it had reached a deal to sell its North American sales rights to a drug called Ruconest to Pharming Group for up to $125 million.
That deal is part of recent steps to offload certain intellectual property totaling upfront payments of $181 million and up to $329 million in potential additional capital based on certain benchmarks.
At the same time, Valeant signaled plans to cut more than $5 billion from the company's $30.7 billion in long-term debt over the next year and a half.
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Papa said Valeant had stabilized turnover in its sales force and is moving forward with the second phase of a branded prescription distribution agreement with pharmacy giant Walgreens.
Valeant is also examining a potential reformulation of its top-selling drubXifaxan, a medication that treats irritable bowel syndrome, ""to improve the customer experience,"" Papa said. The plan follows the February disclosure by Ireland-based rival Allergan that it is seeking U. S. Food and Drug Administration approval to produce a generic version.",0
"Three class-action lawsuits filed Friday claim that agribusiness power Syngenta is to blame for depressed corn exports to China since the seed company released a genetically-engineered variant of the crop before it was approved by Beijing.
At issue is Syngenta’s 2009 release and distribution of its MIR162 genetically-modified corn known as Agrisure Viptera, which is engineered to fend off certain insects known to decimate corn crops. While approved for use in the United States, Chinese regulators have yet to sanction the export of Viptera.
Syngenta is responsible for “destroy[ing] the export of US corn to China,” which led to “depressed prices for all domestic corn,” according to Volnek Farms, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit filed in an Omaha, Nebraska federal court. Volnek and others are claiming $1 billion in compensation.
The two other suits were filed in Iowa and Illinois federal courts, according to Courthouse News. In addition to monetary claims, the Nebraska and Iowa suits seek to enjoin Syngenta from cultivating and marketing MIR162, or Viptera.
In addition to alleging the destruction of the US corn export market to China, Iowa plaintiffs Cronin Inc. and Jim Ruba Jr., who say they do not even plant genetically-modified corn, claim that Syngenta offered “materially misleading statements relating to the approval status of MIR162 in China and the impact the lack of approval would have on the market.”
“Syngenta’s widespread contamination of the US corn and corn seed supply with MIR162, which will continue to foreclose the US export market to China in future years and will continue to lead to lower corn prices per bushel in the US market, as a result,” the Iowa plaintiffs added.
China’s importation of US corn is expected to rise, Nebraska plaintiff Volnek said, citing the US Department of Agriculture. But China ceased importing US corn after detecting MIR162 in shipments, Volnek and company added.
Though Viptera has been planted on only about three percent of US farm acreage, it is difficult to say for sure “that any shipments of US corn will not be contaminated with trace amounts of MIR162,” the Nebraska plaintiffs said.
The commingling of corn from various sources at corn distribution centers is “essentially impossible,” according to the Iowa complaint, which cites other major grain companies Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill, which do not accept Viptera.
Syngenta has been encouraged by the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) to stop selling Viptera, according to the Iowa claim. The NGFA has estimated that actions taken in China against US corn have caused prices to drop by 11 cents per bushel.
The Iowa suit alleges that the release of Syngenta’s Viptera caused the US-to-China corn export market to fall by 85 percent.
Syngenta has claimed that “the vast majority of corn produced in the US is used domestically,” and that exports are not as important, though the USDA says 20 percent of corn produced in the US is exported. These conflicting accounts led to accusations by Iowa plaintiffs that Syngenta has engaged in willful misrepresentation.
“Syngenta’s decision to bring Viptera to the market crippled the 2013-14 corn export market to China,” they said.
In 2011, Syngenta requested in federal court that a grain elevator firm, Bunge North America, remove signs that said it would not accept Viptera-variety corn. The request was denied.
In April, the NGFA, a trade organization for grain elevators, reported that China had barred nearly 1.45 million tons of corn shipments since 2013, resulting in about $427 million in lost sales. China first halted shipments of American corn in November, as RT previously reported.
Concern over the safety of genetically engineered food may have played a role in a recent decision by Chinese officials to move away from GE production of the nation’s own. In August, China’s Ministry of Agriculture announced it would not continue with a program that developed genetically-modified rice and corn.",1
"Manufacturing difficulties have slowed distribution of this year’s flu vaccine, annoying some pediatricians and forcing some people to wait to get the shot they want, experts say.
Blame it on the antiquated technology that is still used to make most influenza vaccines.
Flu vaccines usually start shipping to doctors, clinics and other distributors in August and peak vaccination season is typically September and October. Pediatricians, employers, retail pharmacies and others plan their vaccination campaigns around this schedule.
But this year, delivery has been held up by around six weeks, infectious disease experts and manufacturers say.
“Several companies experienced slower yields than expected,” said Dr. Andy Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases for the University of Utah. “Their flu vaccine is being produced, but it’s coming out slower than anticipated. Deliveries are a little bit behind schedule but they anticipate getting most of it out by the end of October, when most was promised by mid-September.”
""Deliveries are a little bit behind schedule.""
That still gives plenty of time to get vaccinated before flu season starts in December, Pavia said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is not worried.
“Some companies have communicated information to their customers about delays in shipments that had originally been anticipated for August and September,” CDC said in a statement posted on its website.
“Despite these early season shipping delays, however, manufacturers anticipate the majority of their flu vaccine distribution will occur by the end of October. While this is slightly later than vaccine was shipped last year, it is not an unusual pattern for seasonal flu vaccine distribution overall.”
Flu vaccine supplies depend on the private market. Vaccines are made by drug companies and they decide how much to make. But the federal government influences this by buying vaccines for use in child vaccination programs. Federal advisers also decide on the formulation.
“In our case, a portion of our flu vaccines supply has been delayed due to production difficulties that we experienced at a manufacturing facility outside of Montreal,” said Robert Perry, a spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline.
“Vaccines manufacturing is an inherently complex undertaking. When vaccines batches fail quality-assurance tests at any stage of the process, we discard them and start over. This is the primary reason for some of our vaccines being delayed, and it reflects that that patient safety trumps all else, particularly shipping considerations,” he added.
The vaccines that Glaxo makes are done the old-fashioned way, using virus injected into chicken eggs. It’s an inherently unreliable process, prone to delays. Sometimes the virus used as a seed to make the vaccines doesn’t grow well in the eggs.
Perry says Glaxo will eventually deliver 25 to 27 million doses by the end of October.
Dr. Henry Bernstein, a specialist in pediatrics at North Shore-LIJ Health System in New Hyde Park, N. Y., who writes flu vaccine policies for the American Academy of Pediatrics, says he is not unduly worried.
“We have heard it is a little bit of a hassle for some people.""
“Any time there are delays, there is always some concern that some children will not get vaccinated,” Bernstein told NBC News. But he said in terms of overall numbers, the shortage wasn’t bad compared to years past. “We have heard it is a little bit of a hassle for some people,” he said. “Hopefully, it won’t last long.”
This year, the CDC expects up to 159 million flu vaccine doses to be available. As of last week, 98.9 million doses had been distributed. To compare, last year companies made about 135 million doses and by mid-October, 110 million doses were distributed.
Seven companies now make vaccines for the U. S. market – a big change over the 1990s, when just four companies did. There are also more varieties of flu vaccine available than ever before – special formulations for the elderly, for people allergic to eggs, vaccines that protect again four strains of flu instead of three, needle-free vaccine that is sprayed up the nose and vaccines delivered with a shorter needle.
And some companies have vaccines that are not made using chicken eggs. Flucelvax is made using dog cells cultured in the lab. Another is made using genetic material.
Public health experts struggle every year to get the flu vaccine supply right. Vaccine makers only want to make as much as they can sell and in 2012 the U. S. threw away 30 million doses. In 2008-2009 companies shipped 162 million doses of vaccine, but only 90 million were used.
The CDC says everyone 6 months and older should get vaccinated against flu, or about 300 million people. But last year, less than half the population did. People are not afraid of the flu, even though it kills as many as 40,000 people in a bad year, including 100 children every year. But in some years it may be a mild season and kill 4,000 people. This variation lulls people into thinking flu isn’t a problem.
The flu vaccine isn’t perfect, either, leading many to think it’s a waste of time to get one.",0
"The chief executive of Equifax is retiring, the company said Tuesday, just weeks after the troubled credit reporting agency disclosed that it had suffered a massive data breach affecting as many as 143 million people.
The departure of Richard Smith comes as Equifax has drawn fire fromcountless consumers and dozens of federal lawmakers over its handling of the breach. Equifax announced earlier this month that hackers gained unauthorized access to sensitive personal data — Social Security numbers, birth dates and home addresses — fornearly half of the country. The company also faces multiple federal investigations over its handling of the hack and reports that executives sold an unusual amount of stock before the breach was publicly disclosed.
Equifax's board of directors appointed board member Mark Feidler to serve as the company'snonexecutive chairman, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., who led thecompany's Asia Pacific division, will become the interim chief executive.
[After the breach, Equifax now faces the lawsuits]
“The cybersecurity incident has affected millions of consumers, and I have been completely dedicated to making this right,” Smith said in the statement. “At this critical juncture, I believe it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward.”
Smith, 57, had been the chairman and chief executive since 2005, after spending 22 years at General Electric. During Smith's time at Equifax, the company’s stock price had soared 200 percent,and its market value swelled from $3 billion to $20 billion. Smith also expanded the company’s business into 24 countries.
Including salary, stock and changes in pension value, Smith's 2016 compensation was valued at $15 million. But Smith will not receive a bonus this year, according to a new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He will receive an $18 million pension, however. Decisions on additional benefits owed to Smith will be deferred until the board of directors completes an independent review of the data breach.
The board said Smith will act as an unpaid adviser as the company searches for a permanent chief executive. The company also said that the board has created a special committee to examine the breach.
Smith isn't the first high-ranking executive at Equifax to depart sincethe disclosure of the breach. Earlier this month, two officialsresponsible for Equifax's security and information technology — chief information officer David Webb and chief security officer, Susan Mauldin-- alsoabruptly retired.
Congressional hearings about the breach will start next week. Smith is scheduled to testifybefore a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Oct. 3 and the Senate Banking Committee the following day.
Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, told The Washington Post in a statement that Smith's retirementdoes not relieve Equifax of its obligations to answer for its security lapses.
“The public deserves answers about what occurred at Equifax, and its entire board of directors and senior management team should be accountable for the enormous harm caused to consumers across the country,” she said. “There will be consequences. This process is only beginning.”
[Before the breach, Equifax sought to limit exposure to lawsuits]
Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said that the former CEO and other Equifax executives who left should be denied ""a big payday"" with their retirements.“Equifax executives cannot be allowed to wash their hands of this while millions of Americans are left to deal with the consequences,” the senatorsaid in a statement to The Post.
Smith'sexit could clear the way for new leadership with expertise in cybersecurity, security experts and industry observers said. And the swift departure of the company's chief could stem some of the intense backlash against Equifax.
“The CEO should be held accountable, and the chief executive officer is also the chief risk officer, and clearly this company took on risk that resulted in its hacking problem,” said David Kass, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland.“I think the market and investors will be pleased with this decision. A new CEO coming in hopefully will be more security-conscious, with major experience in this area.”
[SEC is hiring more cybersecurity help after breach that may have let hackers profit from stock trades]
Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, said that although Smith's retirement may help Equifax move past the scandal, how theboard responds to pressure from Congress and the sustained public outcry will probably define the future of the embattled company.
“Just removing Smith or having him retire doesn’t mean that the company will be able to address the concerns of millions of people, in terms of their own personal data, Equifax's lack of transparency and why it took them so long to reveal the breach to the public,” he said.
And even as Equifax moves to replace key personnel, onecrucial question is just who the new crop ofexecutives will be.
“This may be good, but it depends who the new leaders are,” Tobias said.
Equifax asks consumers for personal info, even after massive data breach
Two Equifax executives will retire following massive data breach
The FTC is investigating the Equifax breach. Here’s why that’s a big deal.",0
"Former Equifax CEO Richard Smith, who stepped down just last week, faced a roomful of angry senators and some tough questions at a hearing Wednesday. It was the second of three congressional hearings he is testifying in front of this week.
Republicans and Democrats alike are upset about the massive hack of Social Security numbers and other sensitive information at the consumer credit reporting company.
""This simply is not a company that deserves to be trusted with Americans' personal data,"" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, the Senate Banking Committee's ranking member. ""Your actions have exposed over half the country's adults to financial harm.""
The latest word from the embattled company is that the hack involved more than 145 million Americans.
Smith admits the breach occurred because Equifax failed to act on warnings to fix a software security problem. On top of that, senior executives sold millions of dollars in stock after the breach but before the company made it public. And the efforts to help consumers had a series of missteps.
""The whole thing is staggering,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. ""Equifax and this whole industry should be completely transformed.""
Warren, who has already introduced legislation related to the Equifax breach, told Smith: ""When companies like Equifax mess up, senior executives like you should be held personally accountable and the company should pay mandatory and severe financial penalties for every consumer record that is stolen.""
One cybersecurity expert who spoke to NPR said he is getting calls from both Democrats and Republicans interested in creating new rules for the industry. And at the hearing Wednesday, Republicans were landing some verbal blows on Smith too.
Republican John Kennedy of Louisiana raised a series of questions about Equifax's basic business model and noted that the company also has a premium data monitoring service that it charges consumers for. ""You can't run your business without me,"" he said. ""My data is the product that you sell.""
So Kennedy said it seems ""incongruent"" that Equifax charges people to make sure that the information it is collecting is accurate. ""I mean I don't pay extra in a restaurant to prevent the waiter from spittin' in my food,"" the senator said.
Warren zeroed in on another way Equifax makes money. She said Equifax has some of the ""worst"" cybersecurity around because it actually has no incentive to protect people's data from being stolen and used for identity theft.
Warren said that while Equifax is offering free ""credit monitoring"" for a year, after that consumers will have to pay if they want to keep getting that protection. More than 7 million people have signed up for the free monitoring through Equifax since the breach, Warren said.
""If just 1 million of them buy just one more year of monitoring through Equifax at the standard rate of $17 a month, that's more than $200 million in revenue for Equifax because of this breach,"" she added.
Warren detailed other ways Equifax is already making more money as a result of the breach. For example, she said a company called LifeLock has seen a tenfold surge in enrollment since the breach. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, LifeLock purchases credit monitoring services from Equifax — so more money for LifeLock means more money for Equifax.
""You've got three different ways that Equifax is making millions of dollars off its own screw-up,"" Warren said. (LifeLock is among NPR's financial supporters.)
In the days after the breach, some Equifax executives made money another way — by selling millions of dollars' worth of the company's stock. Smith said ""to the best of my knowledge"" the executives didn't know of the breach at the time of the stock sales. ""These are honorable men,"" he said.
But such explanations didn't seem to satisfy Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. ""This really stinks,"" he said. ""[T]he bottom line here is you had a hack that you found out about on [July] 29, you told the FBI about the breach and on that same day some high-level executives sell $2 million worth of stock.""
Lawmakers also raised questions about the compensation Smith stands to get as he retires. ""You leave with your base salary, unvested options and a pension, roughly valued at $90 million. Help me to understand why that's fair?"" Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, asked.
There was some disagreement on the exact amount of the pension and stock. But Smith said, ""I've been fortunate; I've worked hard and I don't set those compensation levels, the board does, and the board is elected every year.""
It's unclear whether the Equifax board will move to reduce or claw back any of that compensation.",0
"Josefina Vidal Ferreiro, the director general of the ministry's US division, said, ""the Government of Cuba has no responsibility for the alleged acts and is seriously and rigorously complying with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961, as regards the protection of the integrity of diplomatic agents accredited in the country and their families, without exception.""
The statement reiterated ""Cuba's willingness to continue an active cooperation between the authorities of the two countries, for the full clarification of these facts, for which a more efficient US involvement will be essential.""
One senior US official said they expect the United States to ask Cuba to further draw down their personnel in Washington to voice US displeasure over the issue, but no decisions have been made.
US diplomats, families in Cuba targeted nearly 50 times by sonic attacks, says US official
The decision came after an exhaustive review of US diplomats' safety in Havana and discussions with the Cuban government, which has vociferously denied any involvement in the attacks.
In a meeting with Tillerson Tuesday, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez denied that Cuba was involved in attacks on diplomats and said the United States was politicizing the incidents. He said his government would continue to work with US authorities investigating the attacks.
""The secretary told him independent of who is doing it, the Cubans have a responsibility for the safety and well being of our people,"" a senior State Department official told CNN.
At least 21 US diplomats and family members have been affected by the incidents that began in November, causing a baffling array of maladies from hearing loss to dizziness to concussions.
US officials say there may have been as many as 50 attacks, a senior US official told CNN, the most recent in August. Some victims have had long lasting symptoms and, in at least one case, permanent hearing loss.
Despite the harassment, some US diplomats told CNN they did not want to depart, saying the reductions likely played into the hands of whoever was behind the attacks and would leave the embassy understaffed during a crucial period where Raul Castro is expected to step down as president of Cuba.
Barbara Stephenson, president of the American Foreign Service Association, said the organization that represents diplomats is against the drawdown.
""Our view is that American diplomats need to remain on the field and in the game,"" Stephenson told CNN. ""We have a mission to do and we're used to operating around the globe with serious health risks. We are not saying there aren't health hazards there. But there are health hazards everywhere and we want the same choice. ""
Using sound to attack: The diverse world of acoustic devices
Investigators haven't determined the cause of the incidents, but US officials told CNN they are convinced someone has targeted American diplomats in Havana with a sophisticated device never deployed before, at least not against US personnel.
Canadian diplomats have suffered similar health problems, according to US and Canadian officials.
But seven months after complaints to Cuban officials and assurances from Castro that the incidents would be investigated, US officials are frustrated by the lack of progress and have considered a range of options from scaling back the embassy to limiting the number of people who risk exposure to a full-on shuttering of the embassy, three senior US officials told CNN.
""We have to consider it. We thought we had corralled this, and then the two cases in August took place,"" a senior US official said. ""It is not as if the attacks address individual personnel officers. Our personnel is broadly at risk. So we have to consider next steps because we need to protect our people.""
A setback to US-Cuban relations
The removal of the diplomats is a setback to US-Cuban relations following the ""new beginning"" heralded by former President Barack Obama when he and Castro agreed to restore full diplomatic relations and to try to move past decades of Cold War tensions and mistrust. It comes at a crucial moment as Castro prepares to step down as President in February and Washington needs eyes and ears on the ground.
A very revolutionary May Day
The Obama administration relaxed restrictions on US citizens visiting the island and, for the first time in over 50 years, re-established direct flights as well as allowing US cruise ships to travel to the island.
The State Department removed Cuba from its list of countries that support state terrorism and Obama visited the island in 2016, the first sitting US president to do since the Cuban revolution.
Some hard-liners in Cuba, including the late Fidel Castro, criticized the opening with the United States, but many Cubans rejoiced as Americans returned to the island in large numbers for the first time in a half century.
Even though he had explored opening hotels in Cuba, during the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump vowed to close the embassy if Cuba didn't agree to ""a better deal"" with the US.
In June, before a crowd of anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Miami, President Trump vowed to tighten restrictions on traveling and doing business with Cuba unless Havana stopped repressing human rights and political freedoms.
Rex Tillerson: US considering closing Havana embassy
Trump blasted the island's government again in September in his speech before the UN General Assembly.
""The United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom,"" Trump said. ""My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.""
More questions than answers
In November, following the US presidential election, American diplomats began to experience a series of strange incidents. As CNN first reported in August, diplomats were awoken late at night in their homes feeling unwell and hearing sounds that resembled insects or metal dragging across the floor.
They were unable to determine the source of the sound, but when they left the room or area they were in the incidents stopped immediately, two US government officials said.
By February, the State Department had concluded their diplomats were the targets of a campaign of harassment and they needed to raise the issue with Cuban officials.
Cuba's old buildings were no match for Hurricane Irma
The devices used in the incidents have never been found, two US officials said, but appeared to be a type of sonic weapon that emitted sound waves capable of inflicting physical harm.
But the physical symptoms that people exhibited varied greatly, preventing doctors consulted in the United States from reaching a conclusion about what caused the trauma, two US officials said.
US government technical experts were also baffled. Some affected diplomats had lines of sight to the street in their homes, while others had shrubbery and walls that blocked views of their homes. Some heard loud sounds when the incidents took place, while others heard nothing.
It does not appear either the US Embassy or the ambassador's residence were ever targeted, three senior US officials told CNN.
""Following instructions from the top level of the Cuban government, a priority investigation was opened as from the moment these incidents were first reported and additional measures were adopted to protect the US diplomats and their relatives,"" said a statement released by the Cuban Foreign Ministry on Tuesday. Speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York, Cuba's foreign minister Rodríguez said his government ""has taken into account the data contributed by the US authorities and so far has found no evidence whatsoever that could confirm the causes or the origin of the health disorders referred to by US diplomats and their relatives.""
Mysterious attacks on US diplomats in Cuba occurred as recently as last month
US officials said Raul Castro denied the attacks and authorized FBI teams to travel to the island to help with the investigation, which is being led by Cuba's Interior Ministry.
Additional Cuban security guards were stationed in the neighborhoods in Havana where US diplomats live and responded within minutes when the diplomats reported a suspected attack.
US officials felt Castro would not have personally assured the Americans that Cuba had no part in the incidents if it had been a Cuban operation, a US official told CNN.
Still, US officials said the Cubans' denials strain credibility as the incidents took place in the diplomats homes and in hotels, locations that Cuba's extensive intelligence apparatus are known to closely monitor. The officials said they believe even if the Cubans didn't know about the incidents at the beginning of the investigation, they must have a clearer idea of what transpired than they are letting on.
Many diplomats live in Havana's upscale Siboney neighborhood, which has surveillance cameras and Cuban security guards posted in front of many diplomats' homes.
Top Cuban officials -- including Raul Castro -- have houses in the same area and are heavily guarded.
Other incidents took place in hotels in Havana where US diplomats were staying, said three senior US officials, also locations that Cuban intelligence services closely monitor.
""It is increasingly apparent the Cubans are involved in some way,"" a senior US official said. ""The Cubans are all over our people while they are down there. If it was a few attacks, you could say that maybe it was the Russians or Iranians screwing with us, but when it happens so many times, especially in the same hotel, it is hard for us believe someone can get close enough to our people so many times. Unless these are beams from outer space.""
After several employees who suffered attacks had to leave Havana due to health concerns, the State Department asked the Cuban embassy to send two of its diplomats home as a reciprocal measures. Earlier this month, Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Florida; Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas; Richard Burr, R-North Carolina; John Cornyn, R-Texas; and James Lankford, R-Oklahoma; called on Tillerson, to declare all accredited Cuban diplomats in the United States persona non grata and, if Cuba does not take tangible action to stop the threats against American diplomats, to close the US Embassy in Havana. Rubio was a staunch opponent to the opening with Cuba under Obama and has supported Trump overturning the measures.
But State Department officials said the decision to pull out diplomats was purely a safety issue and unrelated to Washington's relationship with Cuba.
The reductions in staff will further hobble the US embassy, which is still recovering from flooding caused by Hurricane Irma. Consular services, including the issuing of visas to Cubans traveling to the US and American citizen's services department, have been closed as repairs were being made.
Several of the families of the 50 diplomats stationed at the embassy evacuated ahead of the storm and have yet to return to the island.",0
"Exasperated U. S. senators harshly criticized representatives of Facebook, Twitter and Google at a hearing Tuesday for not doing more to prevent Russian agents interfering with the American political process as early as 2015.
At one point, Sen. Al Franken shook his head after he couldn't get all the companies to commit to not accepting political ads bought with North Korean currency.
The hearing by a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary panel was moved last week into a cavernous hearing room usually reserved for high-profile events like Supreme Court confirmations. About 50 people waited to get in as senators fired pointed questions and waved at cardboard displays of outrageous ads.
""People are buying ads on your platform with rubles. They are political ads,"" Franken fumed. ""You put billions of data points together all the time. ... Google has all knowledge that man has ever developed. You can't put together rubles with a political ad and go like, 'Hmmm, those data points spell out something pretty bad?' ""
Technology company representatives fumbled at points. After Franken pointed out foreign spending on U. S. political campaigns is illegal, Google's director of law enforcement and information security, Richard Salgado, replied only that the search giant would refuse political ads paid with foreign currency ""if it's a good enough signal on illegality.""
""In hindsight, we should have had a broader lens,"" said Facebook's general counsel, Colin Stretch.
The companies all pledged to do more and politely said they understood the seriousness with which lawmakers are taking the question of Russian meddling.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar pressured the representatives to support her ""Honest Ads"" bill, which she is co-sponsoring with Sen. Mark Warner and Sen. John McCain, and which would bring political ad rules from TV, radio and print to the internet.
She dismissed pledges from the companies this week to be more transparent about political ads as an unenforceable ""patchwork"" of self-policing.
""We're not waiting for legislation,"" said Stretch, before Klobuchar cut him off and repeated her demand for a yes or no answer.
""We stand ready to work with you and your co-sponsors on that legislation going forward,"" Stretch replied, echoed by Twitter's and Google's representatives.
Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy browbeat Stretch into admitting that Facebook had no way of knowing the true identity of all of the 5 million advertisers that use its platform every month.
""Of course, the answer is no,"" Stretch said.
The hearing — the first of three this week in which the three tech giants face a public grilling — comes amid the increasing pace of investigations into the Trump administration's possible link to Russia.
Court papers unsealed Monday revealed an indictment against President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and a guilty plea by another adviser, who admitted to lying to the FBI about meetings with Russian intermediaries.
Just five of the full committee's 11 Republicans attended the Senate subcommittee hearing, while all nine Democrats showed up.
On Wednesday, representatives of all three companies face hearings by the House and Senate intelligence committees.
In preparation for Tuesday's hearing, Facebook disclosed that content generated by Russia's infamous troll farm, the Internet Research Agency, potentially reached as many as 126 million users.
The company said IRA-linked accounts generated 80,000 posts on 120 pages between January 2015 and August 2017. Possible views reached the millions after people liked the posts and shared them.
Facebook had earlier turned over more than 3,000 advertisements linked to the agency. The ads — many of which focused on divisive social issues like immigration and gay rights — pointed people to the agency's pages, where they could then like or share its material.
Twitter said it uncovered and shut down 2,752 accounts linked to the IRA, nearly 14 times as many as it handed over to congressional committees three weeks ago.
The Russia-linked accounts put out 1.4 million election-related tweets from September through Nov. 15 last year — nearly half of them automated. The company also found nine Russian accounts that bought ads, most of which came from the state-backed news service RT, previously known as Russia Today.
And Google said it found evidence of ""limited"" misuse of its services by the Russian group, as well as some YouTube channels that were likely backed by Russian agents.
Google said two accounts linked to the Russian group spent $4,700 on ads on its platforms during the 2016 election. The company also found 18 YouTube channels likely backed by Russian agents. Those channels hosted 1,108 videos with 43 hours of material, although they racked up just 309,000 views in the U. S. between June 2015 and November 2016, Google said.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal revealed some of the ads taken out by Russians, including one that showed comedian Aziz Ansari holding up a sign that said ""Save time, avoid the line, vote from home,"" a message that falsely suggested voters could cast ballots by text message.
Another Twitter post urged voters to text ""Hillary"" to 59925 to cast their vote.
Blumenthal pressed Twitter's acting general counsel Sean Edgett to commit to researching how many voters may have been misled into incorrectly believing they had voted because of the posts.

"About the competing plans for a new financial system
A member of the “family” that controls the US, England, Canada, Australia, France and Israel has explained to me the competing plans for a new financial system now being discussed in secret.
One of the plans is the long rumored Amero. The idea is to unite Canadian resources and Mexican cheap labour with the US. This plan has many fatal flaws. First of all it would unilaterally take away Canadian sovereignty without consulting the Canadian people. Many Americans also do not want to compete with Mexicans for jobs flipping hamburgers. Furthermore, this plan calls for trading one US dollar for 10 Amero cents which would be a huge devaluation in disguise. This would devalue the dollar holdings of foreigners and would mean the US reneging on its debts.
A different plan now being pushed by a powerful faction in the committee of 300 is calling for an end to all special financial zones. This would mean the underground financial world (known to us by euphemisms such as private equity or hedge funds) would be united with the public financial world (all those fake numbers issued by corrupt institutions like the IMF and the Fed). This group also wants to finance a Marshal plan for the planet earth which would be great.
This plan has its merits but it would leave the same old war-mongering crooks in control. Furthermore, the world’s Mafias and other shady groups would be put out of business and since they are very dangerous people they are not likely to accept this without being given a new way of earning a living.
A third plan calls for trading dollars and Euros held by foreigners into a new trading currency. This currency would be issued in a manner transparent to all people and countries. The people who have been running the world with their dollar and Euro printing presses are strongly opposed to this plan because it would mean losing power.
If China and Russia and Germany and the Islamic countries went ahead and unilaterally announced a new currency the Satanists who rule the Anglo-French world would either have to go along with the new currency or watch their societies degenerate into chaos and revolution.
In exchange for accepting a new currency, some US and other countries debt could be written off and some exchanged for equity. This would allow those countries to reboot their economies and get their incredibly talented people back to work. This plan also calls for a Marshal plan for the planet aimed at ending poverty, war and environmental destruction within 3 years.
Japan also needs to take back control of the Bank of Japan. Doing this would allow the Japanese to once again invest their own savings in their own country, creating a huge boom.
In any case, as long as the staring match over the financial system continues, the real economy of the world will continue to plunge into dysfunction. Perhaps the Chinese are being too modest.",1

Stars dying without wills?It's a notion that's difficult to grasp, particularly when musicians'estates often continueto generate significant revenue after their deaths.
Yet in some cases, famous faces were just like a lotof us, and despite their millions, put shoring up their financeson the back burner. We don't know yet if Prince's reported$300 million estate will end up in probatecourt(his sister, Tyka Nelson, sayshe died without a will in place), but here's a look at celebrities who died without wills in place– and the fallout that ensued.
Financial status: Jackson'sfamily initially thought he didn’t have a will, and headed to court. Eventually, courtesy of his lawyers, a will surfaced,signed seven years before the pop star's death. Upon its discovery, momKatherine Jackson withdrew her petition asking to be put in charge of her son's estate.
Jackson's will namedthe pop star's longtime attorney John Branca and music executive John McClain as administrators of the estate.Katherine Jackson was named as a permanent guardian to her son's three children,Prince Michael I,Parisand Prince Michael II. She was also nameda beneficiary of a trust set up by her son.Singer Diana Ross was named a successor guardian for the children and their estates.
But it's not over. The Hollywood Reporter says that thanks to posthumous projects such asthe 2009 documentaryThis Is It(which grossed $261 million), a Cirque du Soleil tribute plusalbums, video games and other lucrative memorials, a possible billion-dollar IRS estate taxbattle looms. As THR puts it, ""Now the IRS wants its share, claiming the value of Jackson's name and image upon death amounted to more than $434 million. The estate's own valuation? Just $2,105.""
Financial status: The soulful Brit, who died in 2011from alcohol poisoning,was thought to have a will, but ultimately did not. Winehouse'sparents ended up inheriting her fortune, with thesinger's father, Mitch Winehouse, acting asthe administrator of her estate. It's notable that inAmy, the Oscar-winning documentary about the singer, Winehouse was shown to have a contentious relationship with her father. (Mitch Winehouse called the documentary ""misleading."")Winehouse's estate totaled$4.66 million after debts and taxes, according to the Associated Press. Her ex-husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, did not receive anything.
Financial status:Here's a cautionary tale about estate planning: 30+years after Marley's death,his heirs werestill battling the singer's estate in court. Marley, who died of cancer in 1981,famously left no written will, and under Jamaican lawhis estate was to bedivided among his wife and 11children. That meant Marley's wife, Rita, received only 10 percent of his assets. After years of court battles,Rita and Marley's familywas rewarded with a decision that they wereentitled to Marley's name andlikeness.
Marley's estate has sinceaggressively defended commercial use of Marley's likeness, songs and intellectual property through the years. Five years ago the estatesued Richard Booker, Marley's half-brother,for giving Jamaican tours and coordinating music festivalsin his brother's name.(The case was settled out of court.)
Age at the time of death: 27
Financial status: Hendrix died in 1970 without a will. The fight over his estate went on for more than 30 years. The famed guitarist's siblings had been feuding since 2002, when their father, Al Hendrix, died and left Jimi's sister Janie in control of the musician's $80-million estate. The Washington State Supreme Court upheld the will but the siblings continued battling over the use of the singer's image. According to Rolling Stone, a settlement was finally  reached before a scheduled July 2015 jury trial to determine how muchHendrix Licensing, acompany run by brother Leon's business partner,owed to the Jimi Hendrix estate in terms of damages for sales of unauthorized merchandise.
Financial status: Bono's death cameas a shock: the entertainer-turned-congressmandied in a skiing accident in 1998. His wife,Mary Bono, had to go through probatecourtto becomethe executor of her husband's estate. Alove child also appeared (butlater withdrew his claim). Ultimately,Bono’s estate was divided between Mary Bono (who became his political successor for 14 years), and his two children, Chaz Bono and Christy Bono Fasce.

Financial status: When Cobain died, he left behind a fortune that was estimated in the millions. In recent years, the estimated value has been in excess of $450 million.

In 2010, the couple's then-18-year-old daughter, Frances Bean, took control of her trust fund which was more than a third of the estate.

"A female business acquaintance and FB friend posted this link  to a Playboy article earlier today without comment.  Given the fact that she is more than a bit conservative, I found her post intriguing to say the very least.  I recall Playboy as having been a mostly-liberal publication. Until now.
Some of the points made by the writer -- one Bridget Phetasy (I shit you not, that's her byline) -- include:
HES INSPIRED PEOPLE TO TAKE ACTION
Okay, millions of us are marching and taking other actions to fight back against what appears to be the most regressive and oppressive regimes our republic has ever seen, but at what cost?
HES FORCED US TO FOCUS ON POLICY
I just wish there was a single, coherent policy emerging from the executive branch over the past few days, but wishing doesn't make things so.  Please do carry on...
HES REVEALED OUR BLIND SPOTS
The author elaborates by stating:
...there is little room for nuance in the liberal media circle-jerk.  Excuse me? Are you attacking liberals for a tactic that the Alt-Right have (ahem) honed to perfection? Don't recent events and statements from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  completely undermine your argument, such as it is? And must you compare the serious work by working journalists (excluding Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and other alt-Right channels) in adolescent terms?
HES FORCED US TO RECONSIDER OUR VALUES
This article was written over a week ago.  I think ""our values"" are abundantly clear now, in light of recent developments, i.e. executive orders that would have made Hitler and Pol Pot blush (if not ejaculate, given the publication through which you've chosen to express this opinion), but please, do continue...
HES PROVEN JUST HOW ADDICTED WE ARE TO ENTERTAINMENT
Fine words from a masturbatory magazine (and cable TV channel, as I recall), but I agree: ""we can do better."" However, you're not helping by throwing gasoline on a Drumpster fire.
HES WOKEN US UP
Much in the same way that a two-by-four upside the head would. But at what cost?  This is more than entertainment -- our lives and livelihoods are on the line here, as well as those of our fellow global citizens!
So Ms. Phetasy, my personal and professional recommendation is that you return to writing your ""Sex and Dating"" column and trolling celebrities on Playboy, and leave the serious commentary to others.
Your publication is no Esquire, and you, my dear, are no Charlie Pierce!",1
"A light week of economic news features a survey that could provide a clearer picture of the labor market that filters out the distorting effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Also on tap: reports on bank lending and consumer credit.
On Monday, the Federal Reserve releases its third-quarter survey of bank senior loan officers. The survey could begin to draw more attention as banks grow a bit more cautious in light of the aging economic recovery, which began in 2009. For example, in the second quarter, banks tightened lending standards on commercial real estate loans while demand weakened, notes Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. And while mortgage criteria eased, standards on new and used auto loans got stricter. Alexander figures the Fed’s latest report will show that standards for all of those loans remained more stringent in the July-September period.

More: 261K jobs added in Oct. on rebound in hurricane zones
The Labor Department on Friday said the economy added 261,000 jobs in October, rebounding after hurricanes in Texas and Florida limited payroll advances to 18,000 the previous month. But it’s difficult to tease out any hurricane effects from the overall hiring picture across the U. S. On Tuesday, Labor releases its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, which digs beneath the net job growth total to track the number of openings, hires and quits at U.S. workplaces. It should be largely unaffected by the storms because of the when the survey is conducted, Alexander says. In August, the 6.1 million job openings hovered near an all-time record and the 5.4 million hires were also healthy. If the totals stayed high in September, it could signify a sturdy labor market that wasn’t blown off course by the hurricanes.
Consumer credit has been increased steadily as households chilled by the 2008 financial crisis and recession have grown more comfortable using their credit cards. It’s also a result of steady job and income growth. Consumer spending, Alexander notes, expanded solidly in the third quarter despite the hurricanes. And so economists estimate the Fed will announce that outstanding consumer credit swelled by $17.5 billion in September, up from $13.1 billion the previous month.",0

Mexican silver miner Fresnillo was the day's biggest riser in the leading index, up 31p to 877p, while Antofagasta added 17p to 856.5p as mines in Chile seemed to emerge unharmed from the major earthquake in the area.
With riskier assets in focus, Barclays was 5.3p better at 242.75p and Royal Bank of Scotland rose 5.8p to 322.9.
But Reckitt Benckiser was down 51p at 48.55 after JP Morgan Cazenove cut its target price from 44.50 to 42.50 with a neutral rating, a day after a positive note from Morgan Stanley.
GlaxoSmithKline slipped 10.5p to 15.83 after another drug disappointment. The company has stopped a high profile clinical trial using the Mage-A3 vaccine to treat lung cancer, after deciding it would not be possible to find a subgroup of patients who might benefit. The news follows an admission that the treatment did not help patients with non-small cell lung cancer in phase 3 trials.
Tesco fell 0.75p to 292.65p and Morrisons lost 3.6p to 207.2p after HSBC issued downbeat notes on both supermarkets.

"Could China and Russia’s growing friendship be leading towards some potentially scary territory? In an OpED for National Interest, author Harry J. Kazianis believes that the two countries’ friendship is moving towards the joint development of what could be the most sophisticated naval vessels on Earth.
From an article by Harry J. Kazianis onNational Interest.com:
A recent report may indicate that China and Russia might be considering a big leap in military cooperation: the possibility of jointly developing an aircraft carrier.
Such an idea was raised in a recent piece in theWall Street Journalnear the very end of an article detailing Moscow’s struggles to develop advanced military hardware thanks to economic challenges.
The piece states specifically, “Russia has touted what it calls a strategic alliance with China, which may develop into plans to build a joint aircraft carrier.”
“A defense industry official, however, said China is raising its demands, and wants a controlling stake in the project.
‘We both tout the benefits of our friendship,’ the official said. ‘But the truth is, the Chinese are playing hardball.’”
With Russia now on the cusp of finally selling China the advanced Su-35 fighter, could both sides now be contemplating co-development of what some see as the ultimate weapon on the high-seas?
There are a number of reasons why Moscow and Beijing may, or may not, go for such a deal:
The reasons why Moscow would avoid such a partnership are straightforward.
First, Russia might simply not have the money for such a financially draining endeavor. Modern aircraft carriers cost billions of dollars to design, test and manufacture. Such a possibility seems silly when one considers that Moscow is struggling to modernize its military with other expensive pieces of hardware in the face of economic sanctions and sagging oil prices.
Conversely, Russia might be tempted into such a partnership if China was willing to help finance and develop Moscow’s efforts to create a new supercarrier. Such a carrier,widely reported in the press, would easily cost billions of dollars to create and could drain Russia’s military budget. But if Beijing was willing to pony up much of the costs, with Moscow willing to share the technology, it could prove to be quite tempting.
However, would Russia really want to give even more advanced military technology to China that could someday be used against them if relations with Beijing were to sour?
Beijing could be swayed to work with Russia on a carrier project for a number of different reasons.
Aircraft Carrier development for China has been a top priority for several decades.As I noted back in 2011:
“Back in 1985, China purchased the World War II era Australian carrier HMAS Melbourne for a disposal fee, only to halt its break up for several years to study its design. The Chinese also purchased three Soviet era carriers in the 1990’s from Russia and the Ukraine: the Kiev, Minsk and Varyag. The Kiev and Minsk were indeed eventually turned into amusement parks. However, the Chinese studied both carriers carefully in their ongoing efforts to develop carrier technology. While both carriers possessed nowhere near the capabilities of modern US nuclear carriers, any secrets or technology the Chinese could learn on the cheap would have proved useful for later vessels. Spending millions initially instead of billions later so they could learn from others’ successes and failures would only have benefitted Chinese military planners and speeded up their efforts.”
But Beijing’s efforts did not stop there:
“…The Varyag, the most famous of their ‘casino’ acquisitions, was purchased [from Ukraine] in March 1998 for $20 million dollars. The Chinese company that purchased the vessel had strong ties to the Chinese military, and the then Varyag would become trapped in limbo for over 15 months. Turkish officials wouldn’t allow the carrier to move through the Dardanelles, citing a long-standing rule of not allowing carriers passage through the straits. It has been rumoured that China then offered Turkey more than $360 million dollars in a nicely crafted ‘tourism and economic aid package’ to allow the passage of the presumed floating casino.”
But the Varyag never was kitted out with slot machines or craps tables [to turn the carrier into a floating casino,as was the supposed reason for the sale]. Instead, the Soviet era carrier was completely stripped down and recreated into a more modern aircraft carrier.”
To this day, China has only the rebuilt formerVaryag, now rechristenedLiaoning, to show despite all its years of effort. Even if China were to build multiple carriers, with Russia or on its own, one must remember that a carrier is not a stand-alone weapons platform. One must protect the carrier with assets that can ward off submarines, missiles and other forms of military power that could sink the floating airfield—costing additional billions more. At a time when the Chinese economy is starting to sour, would Beijing want to throw billions of dollars into such a project?
There could be an even more powerful reason that a Sino-Russo carrier development project never gets off the ground: the march of technology.
As we have seen from China itself, many nations have developed weaponry specifically targeting aircraft carriers. While various types of missile platforms have been around for decades that have challenged the carrier’s dominance, their proliferation to many countries around the world—and in larger numbers—could certainly be an argument for Beijing and Moscow to spend their money elsewhere.
As Jerry Hendrix noted in a report for the Center for a New American Security (CNAS)back in 2013 when talking about China’s DF-21D, or “carrier-killer” and the threat it posed to U. S. carriers:
“Using a maneuverable reentry vehicle (MaRV) placed on a CSS-5 missile, China’s Second Artillery Division states that its doctrine will be to saturate a target with multiple warheads and multiple axis attacks…”
“While the United States does not know the cost of this weapons system, some analysts have estimated its procurement costs at $5 million to $11 million. Assuming the conservative, high-end estimate of $11 million per missile gives an exchange ratio of $11 million to $13.5 billion, which means that China could build 1,227 DF-21Ds for every carrier the United States builds going forward.”
So the question seems quite simple: Why would China place billions of dollars into carriers with Russia or even on its own when it is working to undermine the military utility of such a weapons platform in the first place?
Call me skeptical, but I don’t think we are going to see Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin standing dockside glouting over a jointly developed aircraft carrier anytime soon. While both nations have many areas in which to strengthen cooperation, carriers aren’t likely to be one of them.",1
"The estates of Bernard Madoff’s dead sons have reached an agreement with the U. S. government to hand over a combined $23 million to victims of his Ponzi scheme, resolving an eight-year legal battle over the remnants of fortunesthey amassed at their father’s bogus securities firm.
Mark Madoff committed suicide in 2010, and his younger brother, Andrew, died of cancer four years later. Their estates were sued by the company’s court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, who accused the men of profiting from their father’s fraud for years and squandering more than$150 million of client money on their lavish lifestyles.
Under the deal, the estates will transfer all cash, business entities and business interests to funds set up for victims, leaving Mark Madoff’s family with $1.75 million and Andrew Madoff’s family with $2 million, the trustee said Monday in a court filing in Manhattan. The estates will also withdraw their claims in the Madoff firm’s bankruptcy case, which total nearly $100 million, according to the statement.
The accord also resolves an investigation by the U. S. attorney’s office in Manhattan,which oversaw a criminal investigation that led to a 150-year prison sentence for Bernard Madoff and a 10-year term for his brother Peter. Both men pleaded guilty. Bernard Madoff’s sons were never accused of a crime. A civil suit against their mother, Ruth Madoff, is pending.
The claims against the Madoff clan have been symbolically important for the trustee, Irving Picard, who is recouping cash for thousands of victims who lost $17.5 billion in principal when the fraud collapsed on Dec. 11, 2008. So far,he’s recovered more than $11.5 billion, or almost 64 cents on the dollar, by suing banks and offshore funds that funneled cash into the scam.Picard has also sued investors who profited from the fraud by withdrawing more money than they deposited, including Madoff’s billionaire friends.
A separate fund overseen by the Justice Department has another $4 billion to distribute, but it hasn’t yet sent out checks. It’s unclear how much of the money from Monday’s settlement will go to the Justice Department and how much the trustee will get.
Andrew Ehrlich and Martin Flumenbaum, the lawyers for the estates with the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP in Manhattan, didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment. Dawn Dearden, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined to comment until the settlement is approved by a judge. A hearing is set for July 26.
Settlement talks between the Madoff brothers’ estates and Picard hit a dead end last year, court records show.Picard had sued to recover tens of millions of dollars’ worth of property from the estates, including a Manhattan apartment.
Madoff’s sons have said that they didn’t know about the Ponzi scheme and that they went to the authorities immediately after their father confessed to them. Madoff was arrested two days later. The brothers had led Madoff’s market-making and proprietary-trading businesses for years, overseeing real trading activity that lent legitimacy to their father’s bogus investment advisory unit at the heart of the scheme.
“I’m overly sensitive to anybody criticizing the side of the firm that my sons ran,” Madoff said in April in a court-ordered deposition stemming from another lawsuit by the trustee.
Picard, a lawyer with Baker & Hostetler LLP in New York, never believed the brothers’ claimthat hadn’t known about the fraud until Madoff confessed to it. He claimed the fraud at Madoff’s investment advisory unit overlapped with the businesses overseen by his sons. And he rejected a claim by the brothers’ lawyers that the men earned their money through their work and that their families deserved to keep it.
Madoff Explains Fraud: ‘I Always Wanted to Please Everybody’
“The Madoff brothers knew, saw and were simply too intelligent to plausibly feign ignorance about the fraud,” the trustee said in a revised complaint against the men last year. Even the market-making and proprietary-trading business units they ran were propped up with stolen money, according to the complaint.
On the second anniversary of his father’s arrest, Mark Madoff used a dog leash to hang himself from a pipe in the living room of his Manhattan apartment. Andrew Madoff died of cancer in 2014. Mark’s ex-wife, Susan Elkin, and his widow, Stephanie Mack, were earlier dropped from Picard’s suit under confidential terms, as was Andrew’s ex-wife, Deborah West.
Peter Madoff, the brothers’ uncle and a onetime compliance officer at the company, paid Picard $90 million after his guilty plea, while his daughter, Shana Madoff, another compliance officer at the firm, was dropped from the suit. Picard had accused them of spending client cash on credit card bills, vacations and their own business ventures.
The brothers deleted emails to obstruct a 2005 U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe that could have exposed their father’s fraud, according to testimony by Bernard Madoff’slongtime finance chief, Frank DiPascali. They included messages between the sons and other employees in which they discussed altering trading account information being given to the SEC, as well as the company’s true trading profits and losses, according to DiPascali, who pleaded guilty and testified against his former colleagues in the 2014 trial in a bid for leniency.
DiPascali died of lung cancer the next year.",0

"Snapchat is getting a redesign to make it easier to use. But the new look will not make the latest earnings report from its parent company any prettier for investors.
Shares in Snap Inc. (SNAP) plunged more than 16 percent in after-hours trading Tuesday after the company posted yet another quarter of disappointing growth.
Snap Inc. on Tuesday reported a loss of $443.2 million in its third quarter, more than triple its loss a year earlier. The larger loss came with lackluster Snapchat user growth and revenue that was below Wall Street expectations.
The Venice, California-based company said it had a loss of 36 cents per share. Losses, adjusted for stock option expense and non-recurring costs, were 14 cents per share, which was in line with the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Snap posted revenue of $207.9 million in the period, up from $128.2 million a year ago. That was well below the average forecast of 10 analysts surveyed by Zacks of $233.1 million.
Snapchat added 4.5 million daily users in the quarter to 178 million, which amounts to a 3 percent growth. The company does not report monthly user figures.
CEO Evan Spiegel said Snapchat needs to grow its user base beyond 13- to 34-year-olds in the U. S., France, the U.K. and Australia. This, he said in a statement, includes Android users, people older than 34 and what he called ""rest of world"" markets.
""This means that we will have to make some changes to our product and business,"" Spiegel said, adding that this includes redesigning Snapchat to make it easier to use.",0
"On a warm, sunny day last month at the University of Iowa, head football coach Kirk Ferentz wore a white shirt and gold-striped tie to a special announcement about his future. He had just signed the deal of a lifetime — the biggest contract of his life, with enough guarantees to make him a rich man well into his retirement, win or lose.
The new contract included several generous provisions:
Even if he’s fired after this season for not winning enough games, the 61-year-old Ferentz would be owed more than $25 million, payable in monthly installments until 2026.
 He’s guaranteed an additional $22 million from 2021 through 2025 if he sticks around and wins at least seven games each season through 2020. It wouldn’t matter if he’s dismissed in 2021 after finishing 0-12.
If that’s not enough, those guarantees wouldn’t even be reduced if Iowa fired him and he took a lucrative new job somewhere else.
“I certainly appreciate the trust and confidence demonstrated by athletic director Gary Barta,” said Ferentz, who also thanked Iowa president Bruce Harreld.
Less than two months later, Iowa has lost three consecutive home games, adding more buzz to a popular question about contract guarantees for college coaches: Why?
Why did Iowa make Ferentzalmost too expensive to fire after averagingabout seven wins per season during his previous 17 years in Iowa City?
And why are schools, including Iowa, increasingly willing to provide gold-plated parachutes for coaches in an industry where their success is never guaranteed?
Harreld, the top decision-maker on Ferentz’s contract, declined comment. But the simple answer is leverage. Buoyed by rising revenues in college sports, college football coaches are getting paid more than ever, with at least 36 earning at least $3 million this year, up from nine in 2011 and one in 2006 — the first year USA TODAY Sports conducted the head coaches salary survey. They also have more bargaining power than ever and are using it to guarantee their pay at unprecedented levels to match.
From the schools’ viewpoint, that means the potential price of failure has skyrocketed, according to a USA TODAY Sports analysis of hundreds of coaches’ contracts obtained over several years.
Ferentz is one of at least seven football coaches who would be owed at least $20 million in guaranteed money if he were fired on Dec. 1 for losing too many games — a list led by Florida State’s Jimbo Fisher, whose buyout this year would be a little more than $33 million. In 2011, there were 15 coaches with guaranteed buyouts of at least $8 million. This year, at least 33 are guaranteed that much — well more than half of the 53 publicly available coaches contracts in the Power Five conferences.
The buyout boom isn’t just caused by the rising pay market, experts say. In some cases, schools appear to be getting out-leveraged in contract negotiations by coaches and their agents, perhaps because multi-year contract signings are usually sunshiny occasions. With so much optimism in the air at the time, schools might not be considering the dark possibility that the honeymoon might not last.
“There’s such tremendous pressure to generate revenues and win that basically these universities are sort of bending over contractually to get these coaches in the door,” said Martin Greenberg, a Milwaukee-based sports attorney who has represented several coaches in contract negotiations. “Euphoria sometimes overtakes objectivity and intelligence.”
There generally are two types of firings in college sports:
Those fired for legal cause, such as breaking the law or major NCAA rules. In these cases, coaches generally aren’t entitled to additional guaranteed money.
Those fired for losing too many games — which almost always entitles coaches to additional guaranteed money from schools according to their contracts. This is the most common type of firing (17 since the start of the 2015 season), and the terms of divorce are usually set before marriage or renewed vows during contract negotiations, as they were with Ferentz’s guarantees.
“We’re going to call that a sweetheart deal” for Ferentz, Greenberg said.
Many others could be described the same way, and arguably for good reason: Coaches are helping drive those rising revenues. With contract guarantees, coaches also taking what they can get from the market and ensuring themselves some stability in an otherwise turbulent profession.
Consider Texas, where many are speculating about the future of Charlie Strong, whose record in three seasons is 14-18.If he’s fired in December, Strong would be owed more than $11 million. By contrast, Strong’s predecessor at Texas, Mack Brown, never had a potential buyout larger than $3.5 million from 1998 until his resignation in 2013.
Coaches these days “are in the driver’s seat,” Stanford economist Roger Noll told USA TODAY Sports.
On the other side of the bargaining table, schools are taking on even more risk with these contracts — at least until they decide they can’t. Just ask Kansas, which recently bucked the big buyout trend after getting snake-bit by it several times.
It started in 2001, when Kansas fired coach Terry Allen with one year left on his contract at an annual salary of $320,000.
Since then, the Jayhawks have paid three coaches not to coach.
In 2009, one year after Kansas' last winning season,coach Mark Mangino receiveda $3 million settlement fromKU after quitting amid allegations that he mistreated players. The settlement helped KU avoid a fight for the $6.6 million Mangino would have been owed if he were fired without legal cause.
Coach Turner Gill succeeded him and went 5-19 in two seasons before KU fired him in 2011 and bought out the remaining $6 million left on his contract.
KU then turned to Charlie Weis, the industry legend for making a living off of getting fired. Before KU, Notre Dame terminated Weis after a 6-6 season in 2009 and subsequently paid him more than $16 million to settle his contract, with a final payment remaining at the end of 2015.
At KU, Weis did it again. He compiled a 6-22 record before getting fired in 2014 with more than $5.4 million still owed to him in monthly installments, the last of which is due in December.
To replace Weis, KU hired David Beaty and this time drastically changed the buyout provisions in the school’s favor.
If he’s fired for losing, Beaty’s buyout is to be no larger than two years’ pay ($1.6 million total), according to his contract. He also would be required to seek “similar or related employment” and reduce his buyout from Kansas by the amount of pay he receives at his new job— a contract provision that is common in college football but also negotiable.
Beaty’s record at KU so far is 1-18.
Kansas officials declined comment on the contract through a spokesman.
But there’s still a tradeoff for the Jayhawks, no matter how sensible Beaty’s contract might seem for them. Such deals won’t attract the kind of big-splash hire they might have wanted instead — the kind that Michigan got in late 2014.
With $9 million owed him this year, Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh is the highest paid coach in the 2016 USA TODAY Sports survey of publicly available contracts. He’s at the top, in large part, because he has huge leverage, an example of why schools fawn over star coaches and give them much of what they ask for during contract negotiations.
All schools want a coach like him — somebody who can turn a flat brand name into a shiny national power practically overnight.
“There are lots of coaches, but not all are able to win and generate money,” said Greenberg, who has written about coaches’ buyouts for the Marquette Sports Law Review. “That’s where the leverage is.”
Before Harbaugh, Michigan had sagged to a 5-7 season under Brady Hoke, who was owed $3 million for his termination in 2014.
After hiring Harbaugh, Michigan’s football team has become an undefeated, top-twoprogram and likely an even bigger cash cow after contributing $88 million of the athletic department’s $152 million revenues in the fiscal year ending in June 2015.
The problem for schools is that there’s a very limited supply of coaches of this caliber.
“Part of what is going on is the iron law that only 25 schools can rank in the top 25,” said Noll, the Stanford economist. Yet there are 128 teams in major college football. About 20 coaches are capable of being consistently in the top 25, Noll estimated, with about 50 to 75 programs able to generate enough revenue to be among the bidders for one of these coaches.
So the bidding increases, bringing the rest of the market up with them as each school chases more wins and more revenue with more spending.
“Coaches are better positioned in today’s market to negotiate guaranteed deals,” attorneys Russ Campbell and Patrick Strong said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports. They would know. Their firm, Balch Sports, has negotiated more than $350 million in coaching contracts since 2007.
No other major college head football coaches have been at the same schools longer than Ferentz and Oklahoma’s Bob Stoops, both of whom were hired at their respective schools in late 1998.
The two happen to be friends and share the same agent: Neil Cornrich, who is based in suburban Cleveland.
They also have two of the top buyouts in the nation at about $25 million each, a byproduct of their recent success and the stability they’ve brought to their programs.
Cornrich declined to comment on contract negotiations but made a case for why the relatively long tenures of Ferentz and Stoops have added value to their schools.
PHOTOS: COLLEGE COACHES WHO MAKE $4 MILLION OR MORE
“It’s important to understand the continuity, stability, and branding that they have provided,” Cornrich told USA TODAY Sports. “People have grown up with Bob Stoops and Kirk Ferentz being the only coaches at their respective institutions for their entire lives. That creates substantial additional value, especially when both coaches have been so successful, on and off the field.”
He noted that “coaches are the people who are producing the revenue” and their compensation reflects “the value being added and the very few people who can consistently add that value.”
Ferentz’s new contract this year comes on the heels of a 12-2 season last year, after finishing 19-19 the previous three years.
If Iowa had insisted that Ferentz’s buyout provisions be less generous, it’s hard to say what Ferentz would have done instead, though he has been mentioned for other jobs in previous years. Unlike at many other universities, the board of regents that oversees the University of Iowa does not review or approve coaching contracts as a matter of policy. Some say such oversight is necessary because these contracts involve such huge financial commitments.
“This might be a very good wakeup call to the board to be more proactive to ensure they can exercise their fiduciary responsibilities in a more robust way,” said Michael Poliakoff, president of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA), a nonprofit committed to accountability in higher education.
The Board of Regents for the State of Iowa delegates this oversight at Iowa to President Harreld, who was hired last year.
“Even if the board delegates it authority, it can’t delegate its responsibilities,” said Armand Alacbay, ACTA’s vice president of trustee & legislative affairs. “It does so at its own peril.”
Ferentz and Iowa athletic director Barta declined comment to USA TODAY Sports through a spokesman.
Whatever happens, rising revenues still might be able to cover much of Iowa’s rising costs, even if a hefty buyout is in order. Iowa’s Big Ten Conference distributed roughly $34.6 million to each of its 11 longest-standing members during the fiscal year ending in June 2016 and is projected to distribute more than $38 million in 2016-17.
That’s expected to go up even more with a new television deal with Fox and ESPN.
“If you don’t have a buyout in a contract,” Barta told reporters last month,“it’s not a long-term contract.”

"The United States is reportedly trying to fend off an attempt out of Switzerland to change a multi-national nuclear safety agreement in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan.
Reuters and Bloomberg News both reported this week that Swiss officials are seeking addendums to the 77-nation Convention on Nuclear Safety, or CNS, so that countries around the globe are compelled to upgrade energy facilities in hopes of preventing fallout like the one spawned by the Fukushima meltdown more than three years ago.
But while Reuters says the Swiss-led initiative is tentatively being backed by other European countries, the newswire alleges that energy officials in the US, Russia and Canada are all opposed to the measure, which would likely increase industry costs.
Although details of the proposed pact have not been made public, Bloomberg reported that it would involve rewriting “international standards to ensure nuclear operators not only prevent accidents but mitigate consequences if they occur, by installing costly new structures built to survive natural disasters.” In a report published on Thursday this week by Reuters, the newswire said that the proposed changes would not only apply up-to-date safety standards for new reactors, but also carry out back-fitting measures on sites that are already in operation.
According to this week’s reports, however, some of the world’s top energy powers are opposed because, as Reuters’ Fredrick Dahl wrote, any changes to the CNS could take years to be installed if, of course, they are ratified by the dozens of nations involved.
“You are trying to drop a Ferrari engine into a Volkswagen. If you want a new car, let’s go to the show room” and buy one, a senior but unnamed Department of State official said to Dahl.
But experts have previously said American facilities, in particular, are in need of upgrades, with a July 2014 report published by the National Academy of Science that said the US “should access their preparedness for severe nuclear accidents associated with offsite-scale disasters.” Additionally, the authors of that study wrote that America’s current approach to nuclear safety is “clearly inadequate for preventing core-melt accidents and mitigating their consequences,” yet newly-initiated upgrades in the US are being conducted on a scale hardly comparable to what’s occurring overseas: according to Bloomberg, Electricite de France SA is spending around $13 billion on implementing safety measures on its 59 reactors, whereas American utilities will spend only $3 billion on portable generators and cooling reserves for roughly 100 reactors.
Nevertheless, officials in Berne remain optimistic that the countries currently opposed to the proposed changes will come to an agreement that makes facilities around the world more secure.
“Switzerland, as the initiator of the proposal, will continue to collaborate with all delegations and do everything to find a solution that is acceptable to all of us,” Georg Schwarz, deputy director general of the Swiss nuclear-safety regulator, ENSI, wrote to Bloomberg Business Week.
Russian officials did not immediately respond to Bloomberg’s requests for comment, and neither BusinessWeek nor Reuters included remarks from Canada in their report.",1
"NBC parent company Comcast donated $5.6 million to the Democratic Party during its convention in Philadelphia, and NBC providedMonday night’s presidential debate moderator. The Democratic Party released a comprehensive list of donors right before the momentous debate, according to The Intercept.

The donations were given to the “Philadelphia 2016 Host Committee” which was “supporting a nominating convention,” according to the 1,098 pages of receipts and disbursements.
The Philadelphia 2016 Host Committee received the donations and then disbursed them to the Democratic Party.

"Meet Edie, an orphaned Maltese dog who was scheduled to be euthanized at a shelter. Just one day before the procedure was to take place, rescuers from Hope for Paws stepped in and saved Edie’s life. This uplifting video shows Edie’s journey from terrified and hopeless to saved, cleaned up, and loved.
The beloved pup who was once lost and neglected was gently cared for and made new, happy and whole again:
In a nutshell, Edie’s story mirrors what the gospel of Jesus Christ has to say about us: we are all hopeless and scheduled to be euthanized, so to speak. Jesus came down, saved us, cleaned and healed our hearts, and loved us. Edie did not save herself through works; she did not earn her rescue by being particularly obedient, or by making a case for how good she was.
Edie was saved because a human loved her and couldn’t bear to see her put to death. We are all like Edie, in that God loved us and couldn’t bear to see us die apart from him. Edie’s rescue from death is a picture of the beauty and redemption of the Gospel.

US Earthquake Weapon Test Fails Again, Destroys New Zealand City
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
A grim report prepared for Prime Minister Putin by Russian Space Forces Command (VKS) states that the catastrophic 6.3 magnitude earthquake that destroyed New Zealands second largest city of Christchurch on 22 February was another failed test of a United States earthquake weapon similar to the one that destroyed the Caribbean island nation of Haiti last January (2010) killing over 500,000 people.
To the deadly US earthquake weapon that destroyed Haiti we had previously reported on in our 14 January 2010 report US Quake Test Goes Horribly Wrong, Leaves 500,000 Dead In Haiti, and to which, sadly, the only world leader to speak out against was Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez [photo bottom left], and as we can read, in part, as reported by the Fox News Service:
The United States apparently possesses an ""earthquake weapon"" that set off the catastrophic quake in Haiti and killed 200,000 innocents. Don't believe it's true? Just ask Hugo Chavez.
Citing an alleged report from Russia's Northern Fleet, the Venezuelan strongman's state mouthpiece ViVe TV shot out a press release saying the 7.0 magnitude Haiti quake was caused by a U.S. test of an experimental shockwave system that can also create ""weather anomalies to cause floods, droughts and hurricanes.""
The station's Web site added that the U.S. government's HAARP program, an atmospheric research facility in Alaska (and frequent subject of conspiracy theories), was also to blame for a Jan. 9 quake in Eureka, Calif., and may have been behind the 7.8-magnitude quake in China that killed nearly 90,000 people in 2008.
What's more, the site says, the cataclysmic ruin in Haiti was only a test run for much bigger game: the coming showdown with Iran.
The United States nearly complete control over their propaganda media organs had previously been evidenced in our 11 February report CIA Spy Captured Giving Nuclear Bomb To Terrorists wherein we detailed that Russian intelligence services had confirmed that Raymond Allen Davis was a CIA agent, but the American people were not allowed to know the truth, and as we can read, in part, as evidenced by the Press TV News Service in their article US orders media to lie over CIA killer, which says:
A US investigative journalist says Washington had ordered the American media to lie about the identity of the CIA agent, Raymond Davis, who has killed two Pakistanis. The New York Times has admitted that they knew this and withheld the information at the request of the Obama administration from some time maybe as far back as Davis's arrest, David Lindorff, author and investigative journalist from Philadelphia, told Press TV's US Desk on Tuesday.
Further evidence of US government control over their propaganda media organs we had, also, detailed in our 4 January report Top US Official Murdered After Arkansas Weapons Test Causes Mass Death, but which only this past week had Londons Daily Mail News Service revealed in their article Pentagon aide 'was killed by hitman' claims distraught widow the truer facts of this case, and as we can, in part, read:
Prominent Washington aide John Wheeler was assassinated by a hitman in a targeted killing, his widow has claimed.  Katherine Klyce said the way her late husbands body was dumped at a landfill site could only have been carried out by a professional.  The 66-year-old suggested his work with the Pentagon over his decades-long career could have made him enemies who wanted rid of him.
To the catastrophic damage done by this latest failed test of a US earthquake weapon new reports are saying that, aside from the hundreds believed killed, the cost in damage has made it the seventh-most costly natural disaster for insurers since 1970 estimated at over $12 Billion.
According to this VKS report, the US test of this earthquake weapon originated from the joint Australian-US Planetary Defence Base named Project Wormwood [photo 2nd left] located at the Learmonth Solar Observatory that upon warm up caused a 4.7 magnitude earthquake to hit the Northern Territory, and less than 24 hours later was directed at New Zealands Tasman Glacier located in their Southern Alps region 120 miles (200 kilometers) from the now destroyed city of Christchurch.
[Note: The Wormwood Project is named after the apocalyptic end of days star Wormwood found in the Christian Bibles New Testament Book of Revelations.]
The purpose of this earthquake weapon test, this VKS report says, was for the benefit of a US Congressional delegation reported to have left Christchurch barely 2  hours before the catastrophic trembler hit, but who left behind one of their members, the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Deputy Administrator Timothy W. Manning, who is now coordinating Americas response to the disaster.
Important to note is that in the test of their earthquake weapon last year the American military had, also, pre-positioned General P.K. Keen, the Deputy Commander of the Southern Command, in Haiti to coordinate his countries disaster response.
Equally important to note, this VKS report continues, is that just like Haiti was the catastrophic victim of a US earthquake weapon due to a previously unknown fault line, so was New Zealand, and as we can read, in part, as further confirmed by Londons Independent News Service: The devastating earthquake that tore through Christchurch on Tuesday is the product of a new fault line in the Earths crust that seismologists were previously unaware of.
To the science these US earthquake and weather weapons are based upon we have previously detailed in numerous reports, including those linked in this report and: Norway Time Hole Leak Plunges Northern Hemisphere Into Chaos and Leaked Cable Reveals Obama Sent To 2012 ALICE Bunker Due To Norway Spiral.
Most unfortunately for the American people in all of these events is their continued blind obedience to their government controlled propaganda media organs regarding the truth of these things, and who only need to say turn away to get these mindless souls to quit seeking truth for themselves.

[Ed. Note: Western governments and their intelligence services actively campaign against the information found in these reports so as not to alarm their citizens about the many catastrophic Earth changes and events to come, a stance that the Sisters of Sorcha Faal strongly disagrees with in believing that it is every human beings right to know the truth.  Due to our missions conflicts with that of those governments, the responses of their agents against us has been a longstanding misinformation/misdirection campaign designed to discredit and which is addressed in the report Who Is Sorcha Faal?.]

"The following essay is by Sy Montgomery, taken from Sy Montgomery and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas’ new bookTamed and Untamed: Close Encounters of the Animal Kind (Chelsea Green Publishing, 2017) and is reprinted with permission from the publisher.
Everyone wanted to pet Octavia. And no wonder. She was beautiful, graceful and affectionate. The fact that she was boneless, slimy, and living in painfully cold, 47°F water deterred none of us.
What thrilled us—me, New England Aquarium volunteer Wilson Menashi, and four visitors from the environmental radio show Living on Earth—was the surprising fact that Octavia, who clearly wanted to be petted, was a giant Pacific octopus.
When her keeper, Bill Murphy, opened the top of her exhibit, Octavia had recognized Wilson and me immediately; we’d been working with her for several weeks. Turning red with excitement, she flowed over toward us from the far side of her tank. When we put our hands in the water, her arms rose to meet ours, embracing us with dozens of her strong, sensitive, white suckers. Occasionally Wilson handed her a fish from the plastic bucket perched on the edge of her tank.
Soon the Living on Earth crew joined in. People were tentative at first. In movies and stories, octopuses are portrayed as monsters, and the giant Pacific is the largest and strongest of them all. A single sucker on a large male can lift 30 pounds, and the animal has 1,600 of them. Octavia’s were strong enough to leave hickeys on our arms. But she was so curious and friendly that no one could resist the chance to touch her skin, which was soft as custard. We stroked her much as we would a dog, enchanted with the spectacle of her color-changing skin, the sensation of her suckers, the acrobatics of her many arms.
Then, as Menashi reached for another capelin to feed her, we realized the bucket of fish was gone.
While no fewer than six people were watching, and three of us had our arms in her tank, Octavia had stolen the bucket right out from under us.
“Octopuses are phenomenally smart,” Menashi says. And he should know: He has worked with them for twenty years and is expert in keeping these intelligent invertebrates occupied. Otherwise, they become bored. Aquariums design elaborate escape-proof lids for their octopus tanks, and still they are often thwarted. Octopuses not infrequently slip out of their exhibits and turn up in other tanks to eat the inhabitants. Many aquariums give their octopuses Legos to dismantle, jars with lids to unscrew, and Mr. Potato Heads to play with. Menashi, a retired inventor, designed a series of nesting Plexiglas cubes, each with a different lock, which Boston’s octopuses quickly learned to open to get at a tasty crab inside.
And just recently, aquarists at Kelly Tarlton’s Sea Life Aquarium in New Zealand teamed up with Sony engineers to teach a female octopus named Rambo to press the red shutter button on a waterproofed camera to take photos of visitors, which the aquarium sells for $2 each to benefit its conservation programs. Though there’s no evidence that Rambo realizes the end product of her photography, she learned to work the gadget in just three attempts.
Intelligence so like our own may seem surprising in a creature so unlike us.
“Short of Martians showing up and offering themselves up to science,” says neuroscientist Cliff Ragsdale of the University of Chicago, octopuses and their kin “are the only example outside of vertebrates of how to build a complex, clever brain.”
The octopus brain looks very different from a human’s. Our brain sits like a nut in the shell of our skull. Octopuses lack bones of any kind, and their brains wrap around the throat. Our brain is organized into four lobes. Theirs has fifty to seventy-five lobes, depending on how you count them. Most of our nerve cells are in our brain. Three-fifths of an octopus’s nerve cells are in the arms.
The wonder is that octopuses and humans may think, in many ways, alike. We both enjoy learning new things, solving puzzles, meeting new friends. And possibly, we both enjoy a good joke: When Octavia stole the bucket, she didn’t eat any of the fish in it. When we finally realized she had taken it, we saw she had wrapped it in the webbing between her arms, as if she was purposely hiding it from us. As long ago as the turn of the third century, Roman naturalist Claudius Aelianus wrote of the octopus that “mischief and craft are plainly seen to be the characteristics of this creature.” Perhaps Octavia especially enjoyed her caper for having outwitted us humans.
“So if an octopus is this smart,” one of our guests asked her keeper, “what other animals are out there that could be this smart—that we don’t think of as being sentient and having personality and memories and all those things?”",1
"With politics being as divisive as it is, it's refreshing to see bipartisan support among an issue most Americans probably agree with. Republican Oklahoma Senator James Lankford and Democrat New Jersey Senator Cory Booker have co-sponsored a bill to strip taxpayer funding for the construction of professional sports stadiums.
The proposal is quickly gaining steam among Capitol Hill and the public. Much of that support comes among public outcry of NFL players taking a knee or staying in the locker room during the national anthem.
According to Booker, sports leagues are a multi-billion dollar industry and can fund stadium construction without relying on the taxpayer's dime. He goes on to say:
""It's not fair to finance these expensive projects on the backs of taxpayers, especially when wealthy teams end up reaping most of the benefits.""
Lankford released a similar statement, stating that subsidization of private stadiums should not be a priority when the country has real infrastructure needs.
According to the two senators, 36 stadiums have been built or renovated under taxpayer money since 2000. The cost? $3.2 billion. Of course, some have argued that funding stadium construction is a good thing since it encourages higher attendee turnout, which means more money for businesses, ultimately benefiting the economy as a whole. The senators, though, argue that there is no correlation between stadium renovation and economic benefit in the municipality where the facility is built.
Just how expensive is a sports stadium? The Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, home of the New England Patriots, cost taxpayers $72 million. If that doesn't have you shaking your head, then consider the stadium used by the Pittsburgh Steelers, which cost 2.5 times that amount at a jaw-dropping $171.6 million - all at taxpayer expense.
Even in light of the NFL national anthem fiasco, Americans of all political backgrounds can likely agree that a multi-billion dollar sports league can do just fine without a super high-tech facility, or fund the projects out of their own pocket.
Do you agree with Senators Lankford and Booker? Is taxpayer money better spent elsewhere?",1

Mysterious Alaska Pyramid Fears Said Behind US Nuke Test
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
An interesting report prepared by the Aerospace Defence Forces (VKO) circulating in the Kremlin today states that the subcritical nuclear test conducted by the United States last Wednesday (5 December) was in preparation for a much larger atomic explosion being planned by the Americans whose fears are rising over the sudden emergence of a mysterious underground pyramid in Alaska believed to be rising to the surface.
According to Western news sources confirming this atomic explosion, on 6 December, the United States National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) posted on their website that a day earlier it had conducted Pollux, the USs 27th subcritical nuclear experiment since signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Pollux was a first-of-its-kind subcritical test involving a scale model nuclear warhead primary, though this fact wasnt mentioned in their press release.
The CTBT allows these underground explosive experiments on plutonium as long as they dont sustain a chain reaction, however the US has not allowed international inspectors access to its test site since the late 1990s, so the veracity of its claims  that it didnt conduct a very small nuclear explosion  cannot be established. Since the formation of the CTBT, subcritical experiments have been under attack because of their proliferation risks.
Even though this unannounced atomic blast was widely condemned by virtually every nation in the world, ranging from US ally Japan to American foe Iran, this VKO report states that fears rather than arrogance was the most likely motivator for the Obama regimes conducting such a test in the first place.
The American fears mentioned in this report center around the mysterious events now occurring in Alaskas Yukon Charley Rivers National Preserve region near the Canadian border, where on 27 September a tremendous explosion shattered this regions peace and where local news reports state that no one has been on the ground there yet, but over flight photographs [photo 2nd left] have revealed a slumping area that is steaming and looks a lot like a mini volcano crater.
Russian seismic stations located in the Arctic, this report says, were, however, able to detect an anomalous pyramid shaped structure resting beneath the surface of the Yukon-Charley explosion area both on 27 September, when the initial event occurred, and last week due to the atomic blast that, likewise, rippled through the surface of our planet.
Important to note is that when China exploded its largest underground nuclear test on 22 May 1992, geologists and seismologists used that event to study the Earths crust and discovered another large pyramid-shaped structure underground in western Alaska between Mount McKinley and Nome on Norton Sound.
An Anchorage Alaska Channel 13 television broadcast is reported to have aired one news story in the fall of 1992 about the China nuclear test and subsequent pyramid discovery, but to date no official US reports have been released about this strange event.
Dubbed the Dark Pyramid by independent American researchers, this first anomaly was investigated by Emmy award winning investigative journalist Linda Moulton Howe, who in her 2012 report, titled Update On Alleged Underground Alaskan Dark Pyramid, noted numerous mysterious elements to this story, including that the area bordered by these underground pyramids, called the Alaskan Triangle, has become a Devil's Graveyard of lost ships, airplanes and missing people where, since 1988, approximately 16,000 people have vanished.
As 21 December Mayan Apocalypse fears continue to spread around the world, including in Russia where millions have begun stockpiling food and supplies, Prime Minister Medvedev, and after his becoming aware of this VKO report, seemingly joked to a reporter (he thought he was speaking to off the record) that each Russian leader gets two folders with information about extraterrestrials that visited our planet  and stayed here.
The importance of Medvedevs statement lies in this VKO report further noting that on 23 November, Russian satellite forces tracked a massive triangular craft, of unknown origin, from the Ontario Province of Canada on its flight to the Yukon-Charley region where it then disappeared seemingly directly into the ground.
To what the true significance of this VKO report may be, it is important to note that, according to EarthSky.org: The solar system will not cross the galactic plane on December 21, 2012 - or on any other date in 2012 - or anytime soon. Sure, our Milky Way galaxy is flat and round, like a pancake. And yes, the sun does weave in and out of the galaxy's flat plane. However, astronomers have determined that we're currently moving away from, not toward the galactic plane. By astronomers' estimates, our solar system last crossed the plane of the Milky Way galaxy some 3 million years ago. We won't do so again for another 30 million years.
And, with the US now reporting that at least 25 million of its citizens are stockpiling for a 21 December Doomsday, the real significance, perhaps, of this most ominous of dates is not for what will actually happenbut for what the aftermath of such an historic non-event will leave in its wake.

US Forces Strikes China Over North Korean Gulf Oil Catastrophe
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
A dire report prepared for Prime Minister Putin by the foreign military intelligence directorate of the Russian General Staff (GRU) is warning today that Total Global War may be imminent due to the United States shock bombing of 2 Chinese oil pipelines in retaliation for the Communist Chinese ally North Koreas torpedoing and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, which we had previously reported on in our May 1st report US Orders Blackout Over North Korean Torpedoing Of Gulf Of Mexico Oil Rig.
According to this report, US Air Force hypersonic space planes (commonly referred to in America as UFOs) based out of Guam began infiltrating Chinese airspace a fortnight ago for the purpose of target acquisition to retaliate against the Communists.  One of these missions was in broad daylight and forced the closure Hangzhou's Xiaoshan Airport.
Chinese authorities in Hangzhou reported that they had learnt what the UFO was after investigations, but said it was not the proper time to publicly disclose the information because there was a military connection to it.
Unfortunately for the Chinese, the military connection associated with these US UFOs became apparent this Friday past (July 16th) when the port city of Dalian, located in China's Liaoning Province, was attacked by one of them when it fired at least 3 infrared guided missiles blowing up two oil pipelines. [photo 2nd left]
The American attack was successful, this report continues, in that China, like the US, is now faced with one of its largest environmental catastrophes in history as oil from the two exploded pipelines has now covered an area of 165 square miles (430 square kilometers) forcing nearby beaches to close and prompting one Communist official to warn of a severe threat to sea life and water quality.
Even more troubling to the Chinese are their fears of this massive spill reaching International waters which they have recruited 800 fishing boats to help fight along with the 24 specialist ships already trying to contain it.
Worse still for both the American and Chinese peoples are that China and the United States have also activated their upper atmosphere weather weapons against each other which is forcing typhoons into an already storm shattered Chinese Mainland, that already has over 1,000 dead and missing from these storms, and a potential hurricane storm that appears destined for the Gulf of Mexico.
Note: Though not commonly known to the American people, the use of high atmospheric weather weapons among the Great Powers has long been known, and as we had previously reported on in our June 17th, 2008 report Weather Wars Pummel US-China Heartlands, India In Total Chaos.
This report further warns that US and Chinese military forces are on a direct collision course after the United States announcing yesterday its Naval Forces would begin maneuvers in the Yellow Sea next week with its ally South Korea, a move quickly matched by Chinese Military Officials who ordered their East Sea Fleet to display a show of strength against this aggression.
Not being understood by the American people of all of these events is that as their Nation, indeed the World, enters the Final Phase of total economic collapse, the only way a capitalistic society can recover is through war.  And the deeper the economic collapse is, the greater the war must be, this concept being called Military Keynesianism.
To how close our World has gotten to Total Global War can further be evidenced by the Baltic Dry Index, and which shows the status of our Worlds shipping is grinding to a near halt, and which last occurred during the Global Economic Meltdown of late 2008.
Important to note about this report is that it cannot be fully understood without the readers full knowledge of what has been kept from them regarding these momentous events and can be read in these reports:

"Toyota Needs These Startups to Crack the Driverless Code
When it comes to cracking the code for self-driving cars, startups have an edge on big business, says computer scientist Katsuya Uenoyama. That may sound like bravado coming from the co-founder of a venture with just 30 employees working out of a small office in Tokyo, but Toyota Motor Corp. apparently agrees. The automaker last week made a $9.1 million investment in the initial public offering of Uenoyama’s firm, PKSHA Technology Inc. (pronounced pahk-sha), which is developing software that could one day help cars learn to hold a conversation with drivers.“The digital needs of the manufacturing sector have become bigger and bigger, and that’s why we started working with Toyota,” said Uenoyama in a recent interview at his office near the University of Tokyo, where the 35-year-old received a Ph.D. in machine learning.
Toyota’s investment in PKSHA, and another Tokyo startup called Preferred Networks Inc., comes as software starts to rival the motor as the most important thing inside a car, and automakers compete with the likes of Google to make vehicles that can drive by themselves. The market for artificial intelligence know-how is so hot that small firms, sometimes with no products, are attracting investment from corporate giants that simply want access to programmers and a pipeline to the latest research.On its first day of trading, last Friday, PKSHA’s shares more than doubled, bringing its market value to $667 million and making Uenoyama’s 38 percent stake worth about $250 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Toyota owns 2.7 percent. The stock rose as much as 7.3 percent today.Even without a marketing department, Uenoyama says PKSHA is on pace this year to double revenue from licensing its algorithms to nearly a billion yen, or about $9 million.Once known for taking pride in doing everything by itself, Japan’s biggest carmaker has been more open to collaboration ever since Akio Toyoda took over in 2009. An alliance with Tesla Inc. fizzled amid a reported clash of cultures, but the automaker this year agreed to partner with Suzuki Motor Corp. on things including electric vehicle technology and to build a U.S. factory with Mazda Motor Corp. In June, Toyoda told shareholders that the almost 80-year-old company founded by his grandfather was considering all options including mergers and acquisitions to get more competitive.In the autonomous car race, though, Toyota appears to be behind. General Motors Co., which last year spent $581 million to buy San Francisco-based startup Cruise Automation, says it already has a driverless car ready for mass production. By sometime around year-end, Tesla is promising to stage a road trip from Los Angeles to New York using a car that will be able to navigate city streets and even park entirely on autopilot.
Toyota is aiming for 2020, with a more conservative goal of having vehicles that can steer themselves on highways, where driving is less demanding.To speed up development, Toyota spent $1 billion in 2015 to build a Silicon Valley AI research lab, and is said to be considering opening a hub in Tokyo next year. In July, the automaker established a $100 million venture fund to go out and find new technologies.“AI is key to autonomous driving, but car companies aren’t very familiar with the technology, which is why they definitely need help from outside,” said Tatsuo Yoshida, an analyst at Tokyo’s Sawakami Asset Management Inc.In August, Toyota sunk $94 million into Preferred Networks, adding to an earlier $9 million investment in the deep learning startup and becoming its biggest outside shareholder. In a statement, Toyota said the new money was meant to “accelerate joint research and development.”At a recent public forum in Tokyo, a Toyota executive invited Preferred Networks’ co-founder Toru Nishikawa on-stage to narrate a video showing how his technology enabled toy cars to learn not to crash into each other. At first, the miniature Priuses could barely move around an obstacle course without colliding. After two hours of trial and error, though, they were zipping around as if they had professional drivers inside.In an interview this month, Nishikawa said he’d chosen to work with Toyota rather than other carmakers because that was the “fastest path to safe autonomous driving.”At PKSHA, Uenoyama wouldn’t provide many details about the company’s research, but he said Toyota is particularly interested in its voice recognition technology, which will be more important as the steering wheel becomes a thing of the past and talking becomes the main way drivers interact with their vehicles.A spokeswoman for the automaker, Akiko Kita, said Toyota had invested because of PKSHA’s “highly advanced technologies in natural language processing and image recognition.”Uenoyama said a four-year stint as a consultant in Silicon Valley convinced him that the world of manufacturing had become too bureaucratic given how fast technology was changing. After starting PKSHA five years ago, though, he realized this was a business opportunity.“From an engineer’s point of view,’’ he said last week at a press conference after his IPO, “the cars of the future will just be big computers.’’— With assistance by Nao Sano, and Pavel Alpeyev

Niger: Strange mix of US military and migrant hub 05:58
Five Nigerien soldiers also were killed in the attack, according to a Nigerien security official.
The officials cautioned that this was still an early assessment. The Green Berets were part of a team advising and assisting local forces when they were attacked.
A US defense official told CNN that operations are underway in the area to locate the attackers.
A spokeswoman for the French Ministry of Defense confirmed that French troops from the Barkhane anti-terror force based in Chad are currently involved in an operation in Niger. She said the operation is being led by Niger and the French troops are there to support them.
She added that no French soldiers were killed during Wednesday night's ambush.
US Africa Command confirmed in a statement Thursday morning that three US service members were killed in the attack and said the names were being withheld pending the notification of next of kin.
""US forces are in Niger to provide training and security assistance to the Nigerien Armed Forces, in their efforts to counter violent extremist organizations in the region,"" the statement said.
President Donald Trump was briefed on the attack by chief of staff John Kelly, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday night.
A U.S. Army Special Forces weapons sergeant observes a Niger Army soldier during marksmanship training in Diffa, Niger, in February 2017.
Supporting role for US military in Niger
There are about 800 US troops in Niger, and the US military has maintained a presence in the northwest African country for five years, with small groups of US Special Operations Forces advising local troops as they battle two terrorist groups, ISIS-affiliated Boko Haram and al Qaeda's North African branch, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
""Niger is an important partner of ours, we have a deep relationship with them,"" Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the director of the Joint Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon Thursday.
""We are committed to that relationship, we believe that they are as well. In fact, I think it's a very good success story,"" he added.
US officials view Chad, Niger and Mali as being particularity important as they serve as bridges between north and sub-Saharan Africa, saying that local al Qaeda and ISIS affiliates use their control of these transit routes to gain revenue that helps them recruit, expand and export attacks. ISIS uses these North-South transit routes to move fighters northward, where they can gain more easily access Europe and the West.
One official told CNN that ISIS is attempting to illegally infiltrate the gold mining industry in Niger to sell on the black market and finance world terrorism.
Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has maintained a presence in the Mali-Niger border area, despite a multi-year French-led military counterterrorism effort, Operation Barkhane, which began in 2014.
The US military has largely played a supporting role, providing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets in support of French forces operating in Mali and Niger. The French operation involves thousands of French troops as well as forces from Germany, Mali, Niger and other countries in the region.
And while US troops largely play a supporting role, military leaders acknowledge the risks they face.
""Clearly there's risks for our forces in Niger,"" McKenzie said while declining to discuss the specifics of Wednesday's attack, citing ""ongoing partnered operations.""
""Any time we deploy full forces globally we look very hard at the enablers that need to be in place in order to provide security for them and that ranges from the ability to pull them out if they're injured to the ability to reinforce them at the point of a fight if they need reinforcement,"" he added.
US building a drone base in Niger
""US forces are in Niger to provide training and security assistance to the Nigerien Armed Forces, including support for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance efforts, in their efforts to target violent extremist organizations in the region,"" said US Navy Lt. Cmdr. Anthony Falvo, a spokesman for US Africa Command, adding, ""one aspect of that is training, advising and assisting the Nigeriens in order to increase their ability to bring stability and security to their people.""
Terror groups in Libya
Wednesday's attack comes after US drones struck ISIS fighters in neighboring Libya twice in a week in late September.
Those two missions, the first under the Trump administration, suggest US officials have become increasingly concerned that the terror group is regaining strength in Libya.
More than two dozen ISIS fighters were killed in the airstrikes, US Africa Command said.
While the ISIS presence in Libya has been much reduced following a near five-month-long US air campaign against the terror group in the final stretch of the Obama administration, small groups of ISIS fighters had begun to reconstitute themselves in remote desert areas, taking advantage of the lingering instability resulting from the Libyan civil war.
US airmen frtake down tents from the old base to move to a new location, on September 11, 2017, at Air Base 201 in Agadez, Niger.
""ISIS and al Qaeda have taken advantage of ungoverned spaces in Libya to establish sanctuaries for plotting, inspiring and directing terror attacks; recruiting and facilitating the movement of foreign terrorist fighters; and raising and moving funds to support their operations,"" US Africa Command said in a September 28 statement.
US Africa Command did not specify where the US drones used in the Libya strikes were launched from, but the Pentagon is in the process of establishing a drone base just outside the city of Agadez in Niger in an effort to bolster regional counterterrorism efforts.
The US has been using a local Nigerien airport while the base is under construction, according to US Africa Command.
A US Africa Command news release dated October 2 says the construction of the Agadez airbase ""is projected to be the biggest military labor troop project in US Air Force history.""
""While nearby terrorist cells and human smuggling are an ongoing threat, the remote location makes daily operations a task unto themselves,"" says the story posted on the US Africa Command's website.
Wednesday's casualties were not the first this year in the US fight against terror groups in Africa.
In May, a US Navy SEAL was killed in Somalia during an operation against local al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab.
The SEAL was the first US service member killed in action in Somalia since 1993, when two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down and 18 American soldiers were killed in the Battle for Mogadishu.",0

Tremendous amounts of soot, lofted into the air from global wildfires following a massive asteroid strike 66 million years ago, would have plunged Earth into darkness for nearly two years, new research finds. This would have shut down photosynthesis, drastically cooled the planet, and contributed to the mass extinction that marked the end of the age of dinosaurs.
These new details about how the climate could have dramatically changed following the impact of a 10-kilometer-wide asteroid will be published Aug. 21 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study, led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) with support from NASA and the University of Colorado Boulder, used a world-class computer model to paint a rich picture of how Earth’s conditions might have looked at the end of the Cretaceous Period, information that paleobiologists may be able to use to better understand why some species died, especially in the oceans, while others survived.
Scientists estimate that more than three-quarters of all species on Earth, including all non-avian dinosaurs, disappeared at the boundary of the Cretaceous-Paleogene periods, an event known as the K-Pg extinction. Evidence shows that the extinction occurred at the same time that a large asteroid hit Earth in what is now the Yucatán Peninsula. The collision would have triggered earthquakes, tsunamis, and even volcanic eruptions.
Scientists also calculate that the force of the impact would have launched vaporized rock high above Earth’s surface, where it would have condensed into small particles known as spherules. As the spherules fell back to Earth, they would have been heated by friction to temperatures high enough to spark global fires and broil Earth’s surface. A thin layer of spherules can be found worldwide in the geologic record.
“The extinction of many of the large animals on land could have been caused by the immediate aftermath of the impact, but animals that lived in the oceans or those that could burrow underground or slip underwater temporarily could have survived,” said NCAR scientist Charles Bardeen, who led the study. “Our study picks up the story after the initial effects — after the earthquakes and the tsunamis and the broiling. We wanted to look at the long-term consequences of the amount of soot we think was created and what those consequences might have meant for the animals that were left.”
Other study co-authors are Rolando Garcia and Andrew Conley, both NCAR scientists, and Owen “Brian” Toon, a researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder.
In past studies, researchers have estimated the amount of soot that might have been produced by global wildfires by measuring soot deposits still preserved in the geologic record. For the new study, Bardeen and his colleagues used the NCAR-based Community Earth System Model (CESM) to simulate the effect of the soot on global climate going forward. They used the most recent estimates of the amount of fine soot found in the layer of rock left after the impact (15,000 million tons), as well as larger and smaller amounts, to quantify the climate’s sensitivity to more or less extensive fires.
In the simulations, soot heated by the Sun was lofted higher and higher into the atmosphere, eventually forming a global barrier that blocked the vast majority of sunlight from reaching Earth’s surface. “At first it would have been about as dark as a moonlit night,” Toon said.
While the skies would have gradually brightened, photosynthesis would have been impossible for more than a year and a half, according to the simulations. Because many of the plants on land would have already been incinerated in the fires, the darkness would likely have had its greatest impact on phytoplankton, which underpin the ocean food chain. The loss of these tiny organisms would have had a ripple effect through the ocean, eventually devastating many species of marine life.
The research team also found that photosynthesis would have been temporarily blocked even at much lower levels of soot. For example, in a simulation using only 5,000 million tons of soot — about a third of the best estimate from measurements — photosynthesis would still have been impossible for an entire year.
In the simulations, the loss of sunlight caused a steep decline in average temperatures at Earth’s surface, with a drop of 50 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius) over land and 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) over the oceans.
While Earth’s surface cooled in the study scenarios, the atmosphere higher up in the stratosphere actually became much warmer as the soot absorbed light from the Sun. The warmer temperatures caused ozone destruction and allowed for large quantities of water vapor to be stored in the upper atmosphere. The water vapor then chemically reacted in the stratosphere to produce hydrogen compounds that led to further ozone destruction. The resulting ozone loss would have allowed damaging doses of ultraviolet light to reach Earth’s surface after the soot cleared.
The large reservoir of water in the upper atmosphere formed in the simulations also caused the layer of sunlight-blocking soot to be removed abruptly after lingering for years, a finding that surprised the research team. As the soot began to settle out of the stratosphere, the air began to cool. This cooling, in turn, caused water vapor to condense into ice particles, which washed even more soot out of the atmosphere. As a result of this feedback loop — cooling causing precipitation that caused more cooling — the thinning soot layer disappeared in just a few months.
While the scientists think the new study gives a robust picture of how large injections of soot into the atmosphere can affect the climate, they also caution that the study has limitations.
For example, the simulations were run in a model of modern-day Earth, not a model representing what Earth looked like during the Cretaceous Period, when the continents were in slightly different locations. The atmosphere 66 million years ago also contained somewhat different concentrations of gases, including higher levels of carbon dioxide.
Additionally, the simulations did not try to account for volcanic eruptions or sulfur released from the Earth’s crust at the site of the asteroid impact, which would have resulted in an increase in light-reflecting sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere.
The study also challenged the limits of the computer model’s atmospheric component, known as the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM).
“An asteroid collision is a very large perturbation — not something you would normally see when modeling future climate scenarios,” Bardeen said. “So the model was not designed to handle this and, as we went along, we had to adjust the model so it could handle some of the event’s impacts, such as warming of the stratosphere by over 200 degrees Celsius.”
These improvements to WACCM could be useful for other types of studies, including modeling a “nuclear winter” scenario. Like global wildfires millions of years ago, the explosion of nuclear weapons could also inject large amounts of soot into the atmosphere, which could lead to a temporary global cooling.
“The amount of soot created by nuclear warfare would be much less than we saw during the K-Pg extinction,” Bardeen said. “But the soot would still alter the climate in similar ways, cooling the surface and heating the upper atmosphere, with potentially devastating effects.”",1
"Doctors who got their training at low-ranked medical schools wrote three times as many opioid painkiller prescriptions as medics who earned their diplomas at Ivy League or other top-tier schools.
That’s the headline of a new study by two Princeton University researchers who examined two billion opioid prescriptions written in the U. S. between 2006 and 2014 — and the credentials of the 742,297 physicians who wrote them.
And as the U. S. grapples with a deadly opioid overdose epidemic that President Donald Trump declared a national emergency this month, their findings suggest that better training could be key in combating the crisis.
“If all general practitioners had prescribed like those from the top-ranked school (Harvard), we would have 56.5 percent fewer opioid prescriptions and 8.5 percent fewer overdose deaths,” said Janet Currie, an economics professor at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.
So if “you’re trying to improve prescribing practices, then targeting the lower-ranked schools might be a good place to start,” Currie added. “Many doctors don’t really receive any training in prescribing pain medications and some of the things they were taught, like opioids are not addictive, were a thing for a time.”
Opioid overdose deaths have doubled since 2000 and many of those fatalities were caused by drugs that were legally prescribed by physicians. A recent National Institute on Drug Abuse study found that one in three Americans used highly-addictive painkillers like OxyContin or Vicodin in 2015 — a whopping 91.8 million people.
“People on the right talk about all the opioids coming in from Mexico and China, people on the left are always talking about how we need more resources for treatment,” Currie said. “Both those things are true. But what often gets lost is that people get hooked on opioids when they go to their doctors for back pain and other ailments. We have the resources to identify who those doctors are.”
Currie and fellow researcher Molly Schnell culled the prescriptions and prescribing doctors from the market research firm QuintilesIMS and other databases. As for rating the medical schools, the pair relied on the U. S. News & World Report rankings.
Among the findings in their study, “Addressing the Opioid Epidemic: Is There a Role for Physician Education?”:
“General practitioners trained at Harvard wrote an average of 180.2 opioid prescriptions per year, those from the second- to fifth-ranked schools wrote 233 per year, and GPs from the seven lowest-ranked medical schools wrote nearly 550,” Currie said.
GPs prescribed half of all the opioids in that time period, some 758.8 million prescriptions. Orthopedic surgeons were a distant second with 147.2 million prescriptions followed by emergency medicine doctors, who wrote 116.5 million.
The least amount of opioid prescriptions were written by doctors who treated the elderly (8.6 million), heart patients (8.2 million), and children (7.5 million).
When the researchers compared doctors in the same specialty in the same hospital or clinic, the ones from better schools prescribed fewer opioids.
“So the difference is not in the kind of patients they see,” said Currie.
In addition to physicians who studied at U. S. medical schools, Currie and Schnell looked at doctors practicing in this country who studied abroad. They discovered that physicians trained in the Canada and Caribbean were also quick to prescribe prescription opioids.
“I think doctors in Canada and the Caribbean get training similar to the way they are trained in U. S. medical schools. They are taught to ask about pain and one of the things doctors are evaluated on is how they treat pain, “ Currie said. “That puts lot of pressure on them to do something about patients’ pain.”
But that’s not the case the world over, she added.
“Eastern European doctors were the least likely to prescribe opioids,” Currie said.
Daniel Raymond of the Harm Reduction Coalition suspects part of the reason Ivy League-educated doctors prescribe fewer opioids is because they “end up working in systems that have a broader range of options for their patients.”
“A doctor who works for a small practice often doesn’t,” he said. “Then there’s the fact that it’s easier to write a prescription than to talk to a patient about alternatives that don’t involve risky pills.”
Either way, the importance of studies like this if they “validate calls for more professional pain management training in medical schools,” he said.
“The important thing is making these systems work for everybody, wherever they get their health care,” said Raymond.",0
"The deadly US-led coalition air raid against pro-Syrian government forces has been strongly condemned by Syria and Russia as ‘brazen’ and ‘unacceptable’.
Syria said the strikes were a “blatant attack on forces fighting terrorism” showing that Washington’s claims of fighting ISIS are false.
Russia said the strikes breached the country’s sovereignty.
“It is illegitimate, it is unlawful and the latest gross violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic,” Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov said.
On Thursday coalition fighter jets struck a convoy of pro government forces advancing inside a protected “deconfliction zone” north-west of the southern town of al-Tanf.
The US military launched the attack against a convoy of the Syrian military headingtowards the border near Jordan where ISIS are based.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov on Fridaydescribed the attacks as “unacceptable,” which also claimed the lives of civilians.
Speaking in Geneva, Gatilov said the strikes violatedSyria’s sovereignty and would not help efforts to achieve a political solution to the ongoing crisis in the country.
A Syrian government’s military source said the US strike hit “one of our military points”late Thursday, killing several people and causing material damage.
The source saidthe attackhampered efforts by the Syrian army and its allies to fight Daesh terrorists who have been wreaking havoc in Iraq and Syria for years.
“This brazen attack by the so-called international coalition exposes the falseness of its claims about fighting terrorism,” the source said.
“The Syrian Arab Army is fighting terrorism on its territory, and no party has the right to determine the course of its operations,” the Syrian military source added.
Syrian state media provided no precise figures about the number of casualties, but the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said eight people were killed in the attack.
The US said the attack targeted “pro-regime forces… that posed a threat to US and partner forces” in the nearby Tanf base where American troops train what they call “moderate” militants.
Yehya al-Aridi, a spokesman for the foreign-backed opposition High Negotiations Committee holding talks with a Syrian government delegation in Geneva, welcomedthe US strike as a “robust action” against Damascus.
The development comes only a few days after USjets killed nearly two dozen civilians in an attack on an area in Syria’s eastern province of Dayr al-Zawr near the border with Iraq.",1

"WASHINGTON – As the body count mounts in the Philippines’ deadly war on drugs, and its combative President’s rhetoric plumbs new depths, the mood in Washington toward a key Asian ally is hardening, with Defense Secretary Ash Carter hinting at US impatience.
He said he found it “deeply troubling” that President Duterte did not mind being compared to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler by some critics of his bloody war on drugs. On Friday, Duterte compared the killings of drug addicts to the Holocaust.
Influential US lawmakers are warning that the extrajudicial killings in the drug war could affect American aid.
And while the Obama administration maintains that its 65-year-old alliance with the Philippines remains “ironclad,” a senior US diplomat is cautioning Duterte against more anti-US posturing.
“I think it would be a serious mistake in a democratic country like the Philippines to underestimate the power of the public’s affinity for the US. That’s people power,” Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel told AP.
Russel did not draw a direct comparison, but past Philippine presidents have been toppled by popular protests dubbed “people power,” including former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who was ousted in 1986.
Duterte has bristled at US criticism of the drug war and repeatedly spoken about dialing back security cooperation – although he says he will maintain the alliance.
Last week he said that joint military exercises of Filipino and American troops scheduled for next week in the Philippines will be the last such drills.
His foreign secretary, however, quickly said the decision was not final. Such a step would impede Washington’s plans to expand the footprint of US forces in Southeast Asia to counter China.
The previous Philippine government signed an agreement to give the US forces access to five Philippine military bases. That reflected Manila’s anxiety over the territorial ambitions of China with which it has competing claims in the disputed South China Sea.
“If he followed through on this pledge it would be devastating to alliance management,” said Gregory Poling, a fellow with the Southeast Asia program at the Center for Strategic Studies. “How does one sustain a military alliance if your militaries don’t exercise together?”
The Obama administration has consistently played down the significance of such pronouncements from Duterte, which have typically been walked back by other Philippine officials.
On Friday, the Philippine leader said that Adolf Hitler had killed three million Jews and that he himself would be “happy to slaughter” three million addicts.
More than 3,000 people have died in the crackdown on drug pushers and users since Duterte took office three months ago.
Germany and the United Nations – through its Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide – have condemned Duterte’s Holocaust remarks.
“It is impossible to make any comparison to the unique atrocities of the Shoah and Holocaust,’” said Germany’s foreign ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer in Berlin.
UN’s Adama Dieng called Duterte’s statements “deeply disrespectful” of the right to life of all human beings. He reminded that the Holocaust was one of the darkest periods in history and that any glorification of the cruel and criminal acts committed by those responsible was unacceptable and offensive. He added such statement was also undermining the efforts of the international community to develop strategies to prevent the recurrence of those crimes.
Earlier, World Jewish Congress president Ronald Lauder said Duterte’s remarks were “revolting” and demanded that he retract them and apologize.
“Drug abuse is a serious issue. But what President Duterte said is not only profoundly inhumane, but it demonstrates an appalling disrespect for human life that is truly heartbreaking for the democratically elected leader of a great country,” Lauder said in a statement issued from Jerusalem.
In Hawaii for the US-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) defense forum, Carter expressed alarm over Duterte’s Hitler remarks.
“Just speaking personally for myself, I find these comments deeply troubling,” Carter said. A day earlier, he had described the US relationship with the Philippines as “ironclad.”
The State Department has tended to parry questions about Duterte’s outbursts. Spokesman Mark Toner also described the Holocaust reference as “troubling.”
However, Sen. Ben Cardin, top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pulled no punches.
“It is reprehensible and, frankly, disgusting that a democratically elected leader is talking about the mass murder of his own people, with Hitler’s Holocaust as his inspiration, no less,” he said.
Cardin and Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, author of a law that prohibits US assistance to foreign security forces that commit gross human rights abuses, took to the Senate floor this week to decry the drug war. They accused Duterte of terrorizing Filipinos through his drug war and endorsing “mass murder.”
Leahy, a senior figure on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said because of the “systemic challenges” in the Philippines, it may be necessary to consider further conditions on aid until the Duterte government “demonstrates a commitment to the rule of law.”
Carter said he had not discussed Duterte’s comments with his Philippine counterpart, Delfin Lorenzana, who was also in Hawaii for the ASEAN meeting.
“Just speaking personally for myself, I find these comments deeply troubling,” Carter said. The Pentagon chief noted that the Philippines is a longtime US treaty ally.
“Like all alliances, it depends on the continuation of a sense of shared interests,” he added. “So far in US-Philippine history we have had that. We look forward to continuing that. But that’s something that we continue to discuss with the Philippine government.”
When Carter visited the Philippines in April, he praised the strength of the partnership. Earlier this week in San Diego, he called US-Philippine defense relations “ironclad.”
That seeming closeness took a sharp downturn when Duterte was elected president in June. In early September, President Barack Obama canceled a meeting with Duterte after the Philippine leader publicly called him a “son of a b***h.” Later, Duterte said he regretted the comment.
The aid Manila gets from Washington is substantial – although it may pale next to the investment that could potentially flow from regional economic powerhouse China, where Duterte is expected to visit this month in a bid to improve ties with Beijing.
The Philippines received about $175 million in US development assistance in 2015 and $50 million in foreign military financing. In 2016, it has gotten $75 million for counterterrorism and maritime security. Since 2011, it has received three decommissioned US Coast Guard cutters to bolster its meager navy.
Russel said Thursday it was no surprise that senior lawmakers were looking to monitor where US assistance funds were going, given the “collateral damage” from Duterte’s drug war. But he added it’s premature to impose restrictions on aid.
He stressed Washington’s desire to work with Duterte. He said the US-Philippine relationship – rooted in a 1951 mutual defense treaty – remains very popular in the Southeast Asian country, notwithstanding Duterte’s repeated references to rights abuses committed a century ago under American colonial rule.
“All politicians have to be responsive to both the mainstream public attitude and the national security and economic interests of their country. All of that leads to continued close ties between our two countries,” Russel said.
Earlier this week, Duterte said joint military exercises of Filipino and American troops scheduled for next week will be the last such drills, although his foreign secretary quickly said the decision was not final. Duterte said the Philippines will maintain its military alliance with the US because they share a 65-year-old mutual defense treaty.
Aides to Carter said he likely would seek clarification in Hawaii from Lorenzana regarding the future of US-Philippine military exercises.
Lorenzana is well known to US officials after serving for more than a decade at the Philippine embassy in Washington prior to taking the defense portfolio after Duterte was elected.
Earlier Friday, Carter said he wants to encourage more regional cooperation in Asia and the Pacific on key issues like maritime security and combatting terrorism.
As part of a broader Obama administration push to “rebalance” its security interests by paying greater attention to Asia and the Pacific after 15 years focused mainly on the Middle East, Carter is pitching the idea of an Asian security “network.”
“The network will help us uphold important principles like resolving disputes peacefully; ensuring countries can make their own choices free from foreign coercion and intimidation; and preserving the freedom of overflight and navigation guaranteed by international law,” he said. – With AP",1
"Nauert added that the resolution also ""ensures US engagement that benefits the Cuban people, and ensures compliance with the statutory ban on tourism to Cuba.""
The US has typically been joined by only one other country -- Israel -- in voting against the resolution, leading to vote counts of 191-2 in the past few years. In 2016, both the US and Israel abstained.
Trump blames Cuba for mysterious attacks on US diplomats
John Kavulich, president of the US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said the vote ""is consistent with Trump administration policies of ceasing, reversing and strengthening regulations, all with a design to expand the distance between the bilateral relationship and, specifically, to lessen the interest of visitors to visit and businesses to engage in commerce.""
On October 3, Washington expelled 15 Cuban diplomats to match staff reductions at the US Embassy in Havana after the US ordered non-essential diplomats and families to come home after the mysterious attacks on personnel there, CNN reported at the time.
The move drew an angry rebuke from Cuban Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla. ""Cuba has never perpetrated, nor will it ever perpetrate attacks of any sort against diplomatic officials or their relatives,"" Rodríguez Parrilla said at a news conference in Havana.
Those reductions and the decision to reverse course on the UN vote, set for November 1, are just the latest setbacks in deteriorating US-Cuban relations.
Nauert said the administration was acting on its desire to have Cuba offer its citizens greater freedoms. ""Cuba has engaged in human rights abuses,"" she said. ""This administration continues to call upon Cuba to improve in terms of human rights, and also open up to where they would have better media access, better access to the things that we enjoy here.""",0
"Ailing department-store chain Sears Holdings reached a dealthat will allow it to sell up to 140 additional properties as it faces mounting losses and declining sales, likely setting the stage for another round of closures.
Sears said Wednesday that it had reached a deal with a U. S. government pension board to regain the right to sell the 140 locations that had previously been shielded from such a plan.
The company is expected to use all of the proceeds from the sales or financing deals — estimated at $407 million— to fund a pension plan that still supports about 100,000 beneficiaries.
Sears spokesman Howard Riefs declined toidentify the locations included in the agreement, which comes after the company already announced closures of more than 400 stores this year. He also declined to say whether any of the properties are already closed and whether the company could arrange deals that would allow it to lease the sites.
The retailer has been struggling mightily against stiff competition with discounters, the rise of Amazon.com and nimbler rivals.
The accord signed with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. comes as the retailer continues to use its dwindling resources to keep the doors open, including selling brands and pledging assets as collateral.

Sears warned Wednesday that it would post a third-quarter net loss of $525 million to $595 million, which would be down from $748 million a year earlier.
Sales at stores open at least a year fell 15.3%. That included a 17% drop for Sears locations and a 13% decline for Kmart stores.
The company said its performance was slightly better when factoring out a reduction in the number of Kmart pharmacies and a decline in the amount of consumer electronics for sale at its stores.
The retailer also said Wednesday that it had reached its 2017 goal of slashing $1.25 billion in costs, which has included shuttering hundreds of stores.
""This agreement with the PBGC is another positive step forward which, upon closing, will provide our company with financial flexibility while supporting our commitment to honor our obligations to the associates and retirees covered by the pension plans,"" Sears CEO EdwardLampert said in a statement.",0
"Entertainment on Cruise Ships Is Finally Earning Respect—and Serious Cash
The next Hamilton might even be hatched at sea.
Somewhere in the middle of the Mediterranean, a painter seeks to find his muse in an original new show: It involves flying bicycles, a beatbox musician, and acrobats hanging from silks and ladders. If the show sounds Cirque du Soleil-ish, it is. The Montreal-based troupe just launched its first at-sea extravaganza, complete with the option of a preshow dinner, onboard the new 4,500-passenger MSC Meraviglia. When the2,908-passenger Celebrity Edgeis launchednext year, it will feature an interactive spectaclecreated with producers of off-Broadway's experiential Queen of the Nightdinner theater. The restaurant where it will be performed nightly has been designed toevokethe Garden of Eden, and when diners enter, actors called “Edenists”will whisper mysterious, scene-setting phrases into their ears before vocalists, acrobats, and dancers take the stage.Cirque du Soleil’s shows on board MSC ships will be recognizable to any fan of the Canadian circus troupe.As ever-bigger cruise ships mean that a more diverse crowd is lining up to be entertained, the world of cruise-ship performing arts is evolving. Turns out entertainment can be a key factor when it comes to acquiring and retaining customers among the competitive cruise-line set—and people love to be surprised. In the expanding industry, executives are also betting passengers will even be willing to pay for premium shows, like the Eden event, unlocking a potential new revenue stream.
That’s not to say that the days of bland Broadway revues, cheesy dance numbers, and uninspired magic acts—largelyperformed by inexperienced actors—are totally over. But serious competition from new creators is recasting the way cruisers think about entertainment at sea.The $22 million theater commissioned for Cirque du Soleil shows on MSC’s Meraviglia.""We need more venues for more tastes, age groups, and nationalities,"" said Gary Glading, head of entertainment and guest experiences for MSC Cruises. So in addition to its lineup of 45-minute themed variety shows—which feature singers, dancers, and sword swallowers—MSC has invested $22 million to create a theater for Cirque du Soleil on the high-tech Meraviglia. (It’s the first of four MSC ships to develop such a space.) The 413-seat entertainment and dining lounge is custom-designed with intricate rigging for aerial acts—hallmarks of the two Cirque shows that are now playing on the shipsix days a week.On its new 4,140-passenger MSC Seaside, which will make its debutout of Miami in December, MSC is also testing improvisational comedy shows by Toronto-based troupe BeerProv (as in, ""unscripted comedy on tap"").""People are looking for something that's different, that's not the same beige product everyone else is turning out,"" Glading said.Entertainment on Celebrity ships has become more avant garde as the company has pursued the development of 18 original shows.Richard Ambrose, vice president of entertainment for Norwegian Cruise Line, says ""there is nothing wrong with a revue. Broadway has started to do 'juke box' musicals, and that's the same thing.” But someshipboard options are better than others, he added.
Still, on their latest and largest ships, both Norwegian and Royal Caribbean have been replacing revues with more relevant options. Some are slightly shortened versions of Broadway musicals—a little trip to the Great White Way in the middle of the great blue sea. They include such classics as Greaseand Saturday Night Feveron Royal Caribbean, or more recent hits such as Rock of Agesand After Midnighton Norwegian. The shows of yesteryear barely even had a storyline;these have dialogue, upgraded costumes, and proper sets, just like their land-based counterparts. Some even feature members of the New Yorkcasts and production teams.

That’s just one strategy at play. Celebrity, Royal Caribbean's sister brand, is focusing on original productions, some with aerial acrobatics and high-tech effects—already, it has 18 such shows in its lineup. Elyriaisits most daring: It’s a slightly risqué, avant-garde love story with choreography byindustry veterans who haveworked with Madonna and Kylie Minogue. The show waslaunched in 2015 on Celebrity Constellationand was an immediate hit.And then there’s Edge, which hopes to push the boundaries further when it is launchedin December 2018. With interactive elements reminiscent of the immersive theater phenomenon Sleep No More,the show will be different each time guests go. That’s an industry first, according to Becky Thomson-Foley, Celebrity's associate vice president of entertainment. People might go several times during a trip.""The younger generation wants more choices than ever,” said Sarah Beth Reno, vice president of entertainment at Carnival Cruise Line, which has cut its main stage song-and-dance shows down to a bitesize 35 to 45 minutes, so people also have time to pursue such other options as stand-up comedy and live music.""People want to walk around and experience everything that is available,"" agreed MSC's Glading. ""I call it the buffet syndrome. They don't want to miss out on anything.""One of two Cirque du Soleil productions on the MSC Meraviglia.The recent fact is, shipboard stage experiences are translating to quarterly earnings.For starters, some of the new entertainment comes with an extra price tag for guests, unlocking a brand-new revenue stream. (Even for cruises that charge for select activities and specialty dining, theater has always beenall-inclusive.)MSC's Cirque shows are $42 (35) with dinner, $18 without. Celebrity’s Eden show will also come with a cost, which has yet to be determined.At Norwegian, which first introduced a dinner theater circus (created by Florida-based Cirque Productions) in 2010, the profits are obvious. The theater on NorwegianBreakaway, one of three ships with the show, holds 245; with nine shows a week at $39.99 (including dinner), performance revenueon that ship alone can hit $4.5 million a year.""I remember people, even industry experts, saying, 'Oh my god, that will never work,’"" said Celebrity’s Thomson-Foley, referring to optional shipboard specialty restaurants with an admission fee, something that has become an industry norm. ""I wouldn't be surprised if that kind of leads that way with entertainment.""""We've definitely seen a shift in our guests telling us entertainment is a deciding factor for them,"" said Thomson-Foley, citing surveys from last year. And according to MSC’s Glading, ""Entertainment isn’t the reason they book—it's the reason they come back.""Amor Cubano, one of the short, 45-minute shows developed for the Carnival Paradise.The better cruise ship entertainment gets, the more seriously the theater industry is taking it. ""Back in the day cruise ship entertainment was just below accordion players. There was no respect,"" said Norwegian's Ambrose. When he started in the business a decade ago, producers wouldn't even return his calls. Now they’re calling him about their Broadway and West End debuts, hoping to collect franchise fees for road productions at sea (where shows are likely to be performed for years).Some New York City shows may soon get their starts at sea. The original, Cuban-themed musical being developed for Norwegian Bliss by Tony Award-winning director/choreographer Warren Carlyle (After Midnight), for instance,is attracting interest by land-based producers.It's the first time an original production developed by a cruise company is garnering attention from outsiders, Ambrose said. And it’s no wonder: The as-yet-untitled show is being composed by Grammy award winner Albita Rodriguez, with costumes by Tony nominee Isabel Toledo.So how did cruise shows get so good? The short answer is money. Cruise companies are investing in talent andstriking partnerships with award-winning directors, choreographers,costumers, and set makers rather than buying package deals off the shelf from no-name producers. They’re also investing in rehearsal facilities that would make land-based professionals weep: Rather than practicing in conference rooms at motels, as they once did, cruise actors now have state-of-the-art spaces, such as a $32 million studio that Royal Caribbean opened in south Florida in 2015. The contracts that guarantee eight to 10 months of employment? They’re icing on the cake.

"In anticipation of Tuesday night’s Major League Baseball All-Star Game, I began researching a column about Marlins Park in Miami, where the game is being played.
Completed in 2012, the ballpark cost $639 million. Of that amount, Miami-Dade County paid $370 million,
with the city of Miami chipping in another $130 million. It almost goes without saying that they ponied up because Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria, employing the tried-and-true tactic of wealthy professional-sports owners demanding new stadiums, was threatening to move the team elsewhere. Now, after six straight losing seasons, Loria wants to sell the team. He’s asking more than $1 billion—a price made possible only because of his state-of-the-art, retractable-roof, taxpayer-funded stadium. Ugh.
But in searching “Field of Schemes,” the go-to website for news about sports stadiums, I came across a rather different story, about the efforts of the Pawtucket Red Sox, the Triple-A minor league affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, to get a new ballpark. Although the dollars are far smaller (though not so small for Rhode Island), it does show that a team and a government can put together a deal that includes public financing but doesn’t hose the taxpayer. It’s kinda heartwarming, actually.
In February 2015, a group of Rhode Island businessmen, together with a few Boston Red Sox officials, bought the PawSox from the widow of the team's longtime owner, Ben Mondor. Much to the consternation of Pawtucket officials, the new owners immediately declared that they would move the team to Providence; they even had a downtown site picked out.
Two months later, they unveiled their financing plan. They would pay the $85 million needed to build a stadium in Providence, but they wanted the state to reimburse them to the tune of $4 million a year for the next 30 years, allowing them to recoup their costs, and then some. The team’s new president, James Skeffington, a longtime Rhode Island bigshot, played the classic sports-owner card: “If we’re not in Providence,” he said, “we’re probably not going to be in Rhode Island.”
There were two problems with Skeffington’s game of hardball. The first is that thanks to—of all people—Curt Schilling, a Boston Red Sox hero
who, in 2004, helped the team win its first World Series in 86 years, Rhode Islanders were vehemently opposed to giving any business taxpayer assistance.
In 2010, the state guaranteed a $75 million loan to lure Schilling’s video-game company, 38 Studios, to Rhode Island, only to see the company collapse two years later, leaving the state on the hook.
Rhode Islanders have long been skeptical of corporations,
and this only furthered their belief that businessmen were not their friends.
Secondly, there was little appetite, even among the citizens of Providence, for moving the team out of Pawtucket, which, after all, is only five miles from the Rhode Island capital. Like too many Rhode Island cities, Pawtucket has seen better days. A city of 71,000, it was once a big textile center, but that was long ago, and no industry has ever replaced it.
The PawSox have become central to Pawtucket’s identity. The team gave the city a connection to New England’s beloved Bosox, and allowed fans to say they’d seen a young Roger Clemens or Wade Boggs before they’d made it to the bigs. It was the one thing Pawtucket had that no other city in Rhode Island could claim.
“This will rip the heart right out of us,” said Pawtucket Mayor Donald Grebien upon learning of the plan to move to Providence. Even the mayor of Providence, Jorge Elorza, sounded less than completely sold. “I look forward to working with the new ownership team and all stakeholders to explore this possibility,” he said.
At which point Skeffington, who had been the driving force behind the move to Providence, died of a heart attack.
Enter Larry Lucchino. Lucchino, who retired as president and chief executive of the Boston Red Sox in 2015—he remains a part-owner—is a legendary stadium builder. A quarter-century ago, as team president for the Baltimore Orioles, Lucchino spearheaded the drive to build Camden Yards in downtown Baltimore, the first modern retro ballpark and a landmark in baseball stadium design.
A few years later, he did it again with the San Diego Padres, building Petco Park in downtown San Diego. As chief executive of the Red Sox, Lucchino oversaw annual improvements at Fenway Park, which have increased revenue without sacrificing the park’s unique character. Indeed, Skeffington asked Lucchino to become part of the PawSox’s ownership precisely so he could take charge of building a new stadium.
With Skeffington dead, Lucchino now became the face of the franchise. As he and several others sought to get an understanding of the dynamics Skeffington had unleashed, it gradually became clear to them that his approach had alienated most of the state, including its government officials—who, they discovered, had no intention of handing over $4 million a year for 30 years to the PawSox. Lucchino concluded that he and the other owners needed to see first if it would be feasible to keep the team in Pawtucket before exploring other possibilities.
Together with the state and the city of Pawtucket, the PawSox conducted a study to gauge how much it would cost to renovate the 10,000-seat McCoy Stadium, a concrete structure built in 1942 that last had a makeover in 1998. They got their answer in January: it was $68 million, while the cost of a new stadium would be only $10 million more.
Three months ago, the PawSox told the Providence Journal that the new stadium would be a replica of Fenway Park, including the famous Green Monster in left field. This would obviously help players in the Red Sox minor league system acclimate to Fenway, but it would also be appealing to Rhode Island baseball fans, virtually all of whom are passionate Red Sox supporters. In that same article, the PawSox officials said that the team was willing to “make a significant contribution” to the cost of the new ballpark—even though it would be publicly owned. There were no threats.
Finally, in mid-May, the PawSox released the details of the financing, the result of negotiations with Mayor Grebien and Stefan Pryor, Rhode Island’s commerce secretary. The ownership group would put up $45 million, with the state contributing $23 million and Pawtucket $15 million. The city and state would receive a revenue stream that would not only cover the debt service but would probably make it a profitable venture for the government.
The team, for its part, would commit to staying in Pawtucket until 2050. Yes, the new ballpark will have luxury boxes, but the owners have also promised to keep it family-friendly and affordable. The Rhode Island businessmen in the ownership group have agreed to give their profits to charity for the next five years.
Grebien, who retained a soft spot for McCoy, conceded that a new stadium made more sense, and might actually give the city an economic boost. The $45-million commitment by the PawSox, Grebien told me, “is the highest in Triple-A baseball.” One rarely can say this about a sports stadium deal, but this does appear to be a “win-win.”
Alas, the deal, though agreed to by the parties, has not yet been approved by the legislature. That’s not because of opposition but because the Rhode Island legislature had a melt-down over the budget in late June, as the session was coming to a close. It’s possible that the deal might pass in a special session later this year, though most likely it will have to wait until next year.
There are obviously aspects to this story that are unique, particularly the fact that some of the PawSox owners are closely connected to the parent club in Boston. That means their incentives are different from the motivations of a typical major league owner hankering for a stadium deal. And the financial stakes aren’t as high as when the big-league professional teams are seeking public funds.
But the most unusual thing, it seems to me, is that after Skeffington died, the PawSox owners never tried to play one city against another. They understood but didn’t exploit Pawtucket’s emotional attachment to the team, and all the parties acted in good faith to build a stadium without mauling taxpayers.
Jeffrey Loria sure could learn a few things from Larry Lucchino.

"President-elect Donald Trump turned his bully pulpit gun sights on BMW, and threatened to slap a 35% tariff on BMWs sold in the US if BMW builds a manufacturing plant in Mexico. Trump complained auto sales are a one-way street: “How many Chevrolets do you see in Germany? Maybe none,” he said. In verbal retaliation, Germany’s economy minister said the US needs to build better-quality cars if it wants to sell overseas.
The reality is that BMW already builds a lot of cars here — thousands more than it sells in the US. Another reality is that four US nameplate automakers actually have better long-term reliability than BMW, Audi, or Mercedes-Benz. Including Chevrolet.
Trump took time off from picking his cabinet and blasting Saturday Night Live to give an interview with The Times of London. “Germany is a great country, great manufacturing country — you go down Fifth Avenue everybody has a Mercedes-Benz in front of their building, right — the fact is that it’s been very unfair to the US, it’s not a two-way street,” he said, adding, “How many Chevrolets do you see in Germany? Maybe none — not too many — how many — you don’t see anything over there — it’s a one-way street — it’s gotta be a two-way street.”
When asked if German automakers should be building more cars in the US, Trump said, “I would tell BMW if they think they’re gonna build a plant in Mexico and sell cars into the US without a 35 percent tax, it’s not gonna happen, it’s not gonna happen — so if they want to build cars for the world I would say wish them luck — they can build cars for the US but they’ll be paying a 35 percent tax on every car that comes into the country.”
In an interview with the German newspaper Bild, Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s economy minister and vice-chancellor said, “The American car industry is getting worse, weaker, and more expensive. … The US needs to build better cars” if Americans are choosing German cars over American.
What Trump apparently didn’t know is that BMW Group (the umbrella for BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce) is a model for exporting cars from the US. The BMW factory in Spartanburg is BMW’s largest facility in the world, with the most volume: 411,171 BMWs built there last year, versus 365,204 BMWs and Minis sold in the US. Nobody exports more cars from the US — not Ford, not GM, not the Chrysler arm of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles: 287,700 BMW vehicles last year, or 70% of production, and 3.7 million vehicles since the plant opened in 1996.
Every BMW SUV (except the subcompact X1) is built in one factory – Spartanburg — then shipped to the 140 countries where BMWs are sold. Mercedes builds SUVs and compact C-Class cars at a factory in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and is building a factory for Sprinter vans in Charleston, SC.
Nobody is like the Germans when it comes to creating sport-luxury vehicles that handle well at insanely high speeds, which may play against more softly sprung Buicks selling well in Germany (in China, they sell briskly). But Americans do make some US-flagged cars that are more reliable. The J. D. Power 2016 Vehicle Dependability Study, which measures problems encountered per 100 vehicles after three years of ownership, has Lexus and Porsche running 1-2. Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW are clustered at 11-12-14, slightly better than average. But the vehicles of five US-flagged companies are better on VDS: No. 3 Buick, No 5 GMC, No. 6 Chevrolet, No. 9 Ram, and No. 10 Lincoln.
If there’s a reason why US-flagged cars aren’t selling well in Europe, it may be that Ford and GM have cars specifically designed for international markets. Many US-designed cars are also built to be softer-riding and bigger inside and out to take account of our expanding waistlines, when Europeans want cars that make it through narrow streets. Americans are about 25 pounds heavier than in the 1960s.
Among BMW, Michelin (US HQ and factory nearby), and hundreds of suppliers, BMW and Michelin account for more than 75,000 jobs out of a South Carolina civilian workforce of just over 2 million.
If the President-elect wants to pick a fight with BMW in a state than went 55-41 for Trump, he may get push-back from Palmetto State residents and voters hoping nobody upsets the status quo.",1
"Human feet have a very distinctive shape, different from all other land animals. The combination of a long sole, five short forward-pointing toes without claws, and a hallux (“big toe”) that is larger than the other toes, is unique. The feet of our closest relatives, the great apes, look more like a human hand with a thumb-like hallux that sticks out to the side. The Laetoli footprints, thought to have been made by Australopithecus, are quite similar to those of modern humans except that the heel is narrower and the sole lacks a proper arch. By contrast, the 4.4 million year old Ardipithecus ramidus from Ethiopia, the oldest hominin known from reasonably complete fossils, has an ape-like foot. The researchers who described Ardipithecus argued that it is a direct ancestor of later hominins, implying that a human-like foot had not yet evolved at that time.
The new footprints, from Trachilos in western Crete, have an unmistakably human-like form. This is especially true of the toes. The big toe is similar to our own in shape, size and position; it is also associated with a distinct ‘ball’ on the sole, which is never present in apes. The sole of the foot is proportionately shorter than in the Laetoli prints, but it has the same general form. In short, the shape of the Trachilos prints indicates unambiguously that they belong to an early hominin, somewhat more primitive than the Laetoli trackmaker. They were made on a sandy seashore, possibly a small river delta, whereas the Laetoli tracks were made in volcanic ash.
‘What makes this controversial is the age and location of the prints,’ says Professor Per Ahlberg at Uppsala University, last author of the study.
At approximately 5.7 million years, they are younger than the oldest known fossil hominin, Sahelanthropus from Chad, and contemporary with Orrorin from Kenya, but more than a million years older than Ardipithecus ramidus with its ape-like feet. This conflicts with the hypothesis that Ardipithecus is a direct ancestor of later hominins. Furthermore, until this year, all fossil hominins older than 1.8 million years (the age of early Homo fossils from Georgia) came from Africa, leading most researchers to conclude that this was where the group evolved.",1
"LONDON (AP) — An anarchic amusement park by street artist Banksy that mocked capitalism and consumer culture has brought an economic boom to a faded British seaside town.
Banksy’s Dismaland “bemusement park” transformed a derelict outdoor swimming pool in Weston-Super-Mare into a macabre parody of a theme park, complete with a derelict castle, a dead Cinderella and a Grim Reaper in a bumper car.
Local officials say the attraction, which closes Sunday after five weeks, drew more than 150,000 people to the southwest England town of 75,000.
Fans from around the world snapped up all available tickets — limited to 4,000 a day — for the event billed as a “festival of art, amusements and entry-level anarchism.” A final concert Friday night featured performances by De La Soul, Pussy Riot and Blur singer Damon Albarn.
Tourism body Visit Somerset said the exhibition had brought 20 million pounds ($30 million) to a region that has struggled since foreign vacations replaced local seaside holidays for many Britons.
Officials hope to use the shuttered site for future art and performance events.
Banksy said the project was not a swipe at Disney, despite its familiar-looking castle logo. It satirized the tourism and entertainment industries, with exhibits including a sculpture of a woman being attacked by a cloud of seagulls and a pond where visitors could steer model boats crammed with migrants.
The site also featured work by some 50 international and British artists.
The artist told the Sunday Times newspaper he was inspired by the seasonal theme parks that pop up at Christmas “where they stick some antlers on an Alsatian dog” and spray fake snow around.
“It’s ambitious, but it’s also crap,” he said. “I think there’s something very poetic and British about all that.”
Banksy, who has never disclosed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in his home town of Bristol — near Weston — and has become one of the world’s best-known street artists. His often satirical works have sold for as much as $1.8 million at auction.",1
"Here it is! Thanks to the House Rules Committee (but not really) Americans were left aggravated after the official proposed $1 trillion budget was released.
The plan is 1,665 pages long. In my mind, it is a whole lot of nonsense no one wants to read. Like that book, your teacher assigned you to read for the summer, but you already know how it ends, and you hate it.
The citizens of America were given a 72-hour window to take in and “read the bill.” As you can see, most of Trump’s initial promises and plans were omitted
As a result, Donald Trump wants to shut down the government in September, which now seems as a legitimate solution.
Many things were boosted in this bill including: military spending ($12.5 billion) and border security ($1.5 billion). Still, the biggest plan ever, the security wall along the US-Mexico border was dropped.
However, you should look at the idiotic things money were spent on, such as a $295 million fund given to Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program and $100 million funding for opioid addiction.
“Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) boasted that they were able to force Republicans to withdraw more than 160 unrelated policy measures, known as riders, including those that would have cut environmental funding and scaled back financial regulations for Wall Street,” the Post reported.
“Among the bipartisan victories is $407 million in wildfire relief for western states and a decision to permanently extend a program that provides health-care coverage for coal miners,” the Post reported.
The budget also dropped the deportation funding applied for sanctuary cities.
Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen encouraged everyone this was a step forward: “The agreement will move the needle forward on conservative priorities and will ensure that the essential functions of the federal government are maintained,” Hing said.
“The agreement will move the needle forward on conservative priorities and will ensure that the essential functions of the federal government are maintained,” Hing said.

"The nation’s two largest for-profit prison companies, Tennessee-based Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and Florida-based GEO Group (GEO), are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Other private prison firms, including Management & Training Corporation (MTC), Community Education Centers (CEC), LaSalle Southwest Corrections and Emerald Correctional Management, are privately-held and thus do not have public stock.
As of July 2015, CCA had issued approximately 117 million shares of stock with a market cap of $4.05 billion, while GEO had issued around 75 million shares with a market cap of $2.76 billion. So who owns the vast majority of stock in these two companies? The answer is not everyday people or individual investors, but rather other corporations – banks, mutual fund management companies and private equity firms – as well as public employee retirement systems.
In fact, around 92.4% of CCA’s stock was owned by 300 institutional investors while 91.1% of GEO Group stock was owned by 272 institutional investors at the end of July 2015. In some cases, the same institutional investors held stock in both companies.
The largest owner of CCA stock was Vanguard Group, Inc., with 16.79 million shares valued at $578.9 million, followed by Vanguard’s Specialized-REIT Index Fund, a mutual fund, with 8.8 million shares. Other top institutional investors included Managed Account Advisors with 6.4 million shares, London Co. of Virginia with 6.13 million shares and Epoch Investment Partners, Inc. with just over 6 million shares.
CCA’s ten largest institutional investors owned approximately 67.7 million shares in the company, or almost 58% of the company’s total issued stock. Banks that are heavily invested in CCA include the Bank of New York Mellon Corp. with 2.46 million shares, and Wells Fargo & Company with 1.24 million shares.
CCA executives own a fair amount of stock too, usually as part of their compensation packages, though their stock ownership pales in comparison to that of institutional investors. CCA board member Joseph V. Russell owned 204,306 shares as of February 2015, while the company’s CEO, Damon Hininger, owned 181,833 shares as of March 16, 2015. CCA board member Thurgood Marshall, Jr., son of the late U. S. Supreme Court justice (and FBI informant), owned 42,391 shares as of March 30, 2015, and CCA executive vice president Harley G. Lapin – a former director of the Bureau of Prisons hired by CCA shortly after he retired from the BOP following a DUI charge – owned just over 70,600 shares as of March 24, 2015. [See:PLN, May 2011, p.20].https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/issues/05pln11.pdf
Vanguard Group, Inc., is also the largest institutional investor in GEO Group, owning 11.43 million shares; Vanguard owns another 5.5 million shares through its Specialized-REIT Index Fund. Other top institutional owners in the company include Blackrock Fund Advisors with 4.9 million shares, Eagle Asset Management with 2.92 million shares, and Fidelity Small Cap Discovery Fund and Fidelity Management and Research Co., each with 2.4 million shares.
GEO Group’s top ten institutional holders, including mutual funds, owned around 37.4 million shares, or close to 50% of the company’s total issued stock. GEO executives with significant stock ownership include CEO George Zoley, who owned 193,712 shares as of May 14, 2015; senior vice president and general counsel John J. Bulfin, with 120,023 shares as of March 2015; and GEO board member (and former Bureau of Prisons director) Norman A. Carlson, who owned 34,894 shares as of June 8, 2015.
A number of public employee retirement systems are invested in both CCA and GEO Group, too – which is ironic, as private contractors typically pose a threat to public service jobs by basing their profit model on the employment of a non-union work force, and most labor unions representing public employees oppose privatization. Specifically, unions representing public prison staff, such as the American Federal of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and Service Employees Int’l Union (SEIU), oppose private prisons.
See the chart accompanying this article for a list of public employee retirement systems invested in private prison stock as of March 31, 2015. Public retirement systems in at least 18 states own stock in CCA and/or GEO Group, totaling over 2.5 million shares in CCA and 1.11 million shares in GEO. At current stock prices as of the end of July 2015, those public retirement system holdings were worth $88.6 million and $41.3 million, respectively.
But who owns private prison stock as individual shareholders? That is, do federal, state or local lawmakers, or corrections officials, or judges, or other public employee stakeholders in our criminal justice system own shares of CCA or GEO Group? That’s hard to say – literally. While institutional investor ownership is a matter of public record, most individual shareholders own stock through brokerage firms, mutual funds, retirement accounts or other investment vehicles, not directly; thus, it’s difficult to connect them to specific stock ownership.
Further, although headquartered in Tennessee, CCA is incorporated in Maryland. Under Maryland state law, MD Corp. & Assn. Code § 2-513 (2013), only shareholders who own “at least 5 percent of the outstanding stock” of a company may inspect and copy its stock ledger – i.e., its list of shareholders. Since CCA has around 117 million shares of outstanding stock, an investor would have to own about 5.85 million shares (currently valued at over $200 million) before they could obtain a copy of the company’s shareholder list.
As a Florida corporation, GEO Group is required to allow investors to inspect and copy its shareholder list upon request, pursuant to § 607.1602(2)(c) of the Florida Business Corporation Act. The request must be made “in good faith and for a proper purpose,” the purpose must be described with “reasonable particularity,” and the records to be inspected must be “directly connected with the shareholder’s purpose.”
PLNmanaging editor Alex Friedmann, who owns a small amount of CCA and GEO stock as an activist investor, which allows him to attend the companies’ annual shareholder meetings and file shareholder resolutions, requested and obtained a copy of GEO’s shareholder list at the company’s last annual meeting on April 29, 2015. [See:PLN, June 2015, p.56].
However, Florida law prohibits shareholders from selling or “otherwise distribut[ing]” any information or records obtained from the company for reasons that are not related to the proper purpose specified when requesting the records, with a fine of $5,000 applicable for violations of that provision. As a result, GEO Group’s shareholder list cannot be distributed without violating Florida law and incurring civil penalties.
Thus, the individual shareholders who own stock in both CCA and GEO remain shrouded in secrecy – much like private prison companies themselves, which have a long history of being non-transparent and lacking public accountability even though almost all of their revenue is obtained from government contracts paid with taxpayer funds.",1
"More than 9 million Americans have gotten health insurance for the first time thanks to Obamacare, according to a new report from the Rand Corporation.
Most of the people who got new insurance didn’t buy it on the Obamacare exchanges but rather signed up with an employer, the survey found. Rand says that 8.2 million people have gained insurance from an employer since September — more than 7 million of them who had no health insurance before.
“We see that of the 40.7 million who were uninsured in 2013, 14.5 million gained coverage, but 5.2 million lost coverage, for a net gain in coverage of approximately 9.3 million,” the Rand report reads. Only about 1 million lost their private plans, and another 2 million lost employer-sponsored coverage.
The report adds to a growing number of studies trying to determine just what effect the 2010 Affordable Care Act is having on rates of health insurance in the U. S. The law is designed to start transforming the U.S. healthcare system in part by getting insurance to more people.
Most Americans get their health coverage through an employer, and the law requires more employers to provide health insurance.
Two other reports published in the past week show the rate of people lacking health insurance has fallen to about 15 percent in recent months, and the Rand survey supports this.
The Obama administration says more than 7 million people have signed up for health insurance on the new, online exchanges. The Rand survey of 2,425 adults estimates a much lower number — 3.6 million — but the researchers say their findings do not reflect everyone who may have signed up in the final days of open enrollment in March.
“Although a total of 3.9 million people enrolled in marketplace plans, only 1.4 million of these individuals were previously uninsured,” Rand says in comments on its blog.
“Medicaid enrollment increased by 5.9 million,” it adds. The Obama administration has only claimed 3 million.
Rand also estimates that fewer than 1 million people who had private health insurance lost their coverage when the plans were cancelled because they did not meet the new requirements of the law for providing minimum coverage. “While the survey cannot tell if this latter group lost their insurance due to cancellation or because they simply felt the cost was too high, the overall number is very small, representing less than 1 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 64,” the report reads.
""Urban, Gallup, and RAND all say the number of uninsured is declining since the ACA went into effect. Now we can debate why and by how much,"" the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Larry Levitt said in a tweet.",0

U. S. regulators said they have jurisdiction over one of the hottest new areas of finance: initial coin offerings of digital currencies.
Companies that raise money through the sale of digital assets must adhere to federal securities laws, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday. Issuers must register the deals with the government unless they have a valid excuse, as should exchanges that offer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, the regulator said.
“It’s been a long time coming and this is a big deal,” said Angela Walch, associate professor at St. Mary’s University School of Law. “People have been waiting for some kind of signal from regulators on ICOs.” This is the most detailed the SEC has been about how digital currencies and the exchanges where they trade fit into financial markets, she said. “It’s a reminder that basic consumer protection principles still apply” in the digital asset world, she added. “The tech people coming in don’t necessarily realize they’re playing with fire.”
Startups have raised hundreds of millions of dollars selling such tokens in 2017, bypassing traditional initial public offerings of shares -- a process overseen by the SEC -- in favor of so-far mostly unregulated ICOs. The commission examined the sale of tokens to fund a startup known as the DAO last year, which raised about $150 million over four weeks, according to the SEC’s investigative report released Tuesday.
Read More: Digital Coins Are So Hot, Startups Are Selling Them Like an IPO
The agency’s enforcement division was asked to decide if the DAO token sales “violated federal securities laws with unregistered offers and sales of DAO Tokens in exchange for ‘Ether,’ a virtual currency,” the report said. The SEC decided not to bring charges in the DAO token sale case.
Instead, the SEC report said it wanted “to caution the industry and market participants: the federal securities laws apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U. S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology.”
One recent ICO was led by Gnosis, a prediction market application based on the Ethereum blockchain. It raised $12.5 million in 12 minutes on April 24, resulting in a market value of almost $300 million. It’s generated no revenue and has little more than a white paper describing what it intends to do. Yet its tokens, which would allow users to bet on things such as election outcomes, have soared 200 percent since early May, according to Coinmarketcap.com.
An open question is whether the SEC will apply these new standards to coin offerings that have already happened, said Walch, who is also a research fellow at the Centre for Blockchain Technologies at University College London. And while the SEC won’t pursue action related to the DAO token sale, “I don’t see anything in here that says there won’t be enforcement actions against others,” she said. Some recent ICO have been “egregious,” she said. “I’d be very surprised if they were willing to shove them all under the rug.”
The SEC decision comes a day after the U. S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission gave LedgerX LLC approval to offer options trading based on bitcoin. That could help mature the business of bitcoin trading by helping traders offset risks with derivatives. But it also underscored the fact that digital currencies, decentralized technologies that appeal to the libertarian-minded, probably cannot escape governments.
ICOs offer an attractive deal to young companies: going directly to customers for funding, avoiding venture-capital firms and other professionals. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton addressed the balance he’s trying to strike, saying in the regulator’s statement that, “We seek to foster innovative and beneficial ways to raise capital, while ensuring -- first and foremost -- that investors and our markets are protected.”
“What the SEC did not say is that all tokens are securities. Rather, they suggest a facts-and-circumstances test,” Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director at Coin Center, said in an email. “We believe that applying the same facts-and-circumstances test to other tokens will mean that some do not fit into the definition of securities, particularly tokens with an underlying utility rather than a mere speculative investment value.”
Markets such as Coinbase Inc.’s GDAX and Gemini Trust Co. that offer trading in digital assets so far have dealt mostly with state, not federal, regulators. The SEC now says that will likely change. “Additionally, securities exchanges providing for trading in these securities must register unless they are exempt,” the agency said.
Calling that a “big deal,” Walch said, “Those in the crypto world have been acting as if they live in an alternate universe, and the SEC has delivered a reminder that they still live in the real world, with real investors and real people making decisions that they must be accountable for.”",0

"A series of successful North Korean missile tests has demonstrated its growing power and expertise, stoking tensions with the US.
The November test of a previously unknown type of missile known as Hwasong-15 was North Korea's highest altitude flight to date.
This followed North Korea's largest nuclear test on 3 September, and a second ballistic missile test flight over Japan on 15 September.
Here's what you need to know about the North's weapons programme and military forces, and the South Korean and American forces in the region which could be involved should conflict occur.
A string of missile tests in 2017 suggest that North Korea is becoming more successful at developing missiles which may have the potential to strike long range targets, including possibly on the US mainland.
In May 2017, North Korea test fired a Hwasong 12 missile, which analysts believe could have a range of up to 4,500km, putting US military bases on the Pacific island of Guam well within in striking distance.
But two tests in July of the Hwasong-14 missile demonstrated even greater potential, possibly giving North Korea its first truly intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
Analysts believe this missile could be a two-stage version of the Hwasong-12.  Initial estimates suggested a range of about 8,000km, but later studies suggested that it could travel as far as 10,000km if fired on a maximising trajectory, allowing it to potentially hit New York.
In August 2017 the second missile test of the Hwasong 12 travelled over Japan, the first time a ballistic missile has flown over the territory and was described as an ""unprecedented threat"".
This was repeated on 15 September with a missile that flew a greater distance and reached a higher altitude than the August test, demonstrating an improvement in range for the missile.
Then came the Hwasong 15 test on 29 November, which saw a missile fired to an estimated altitude of 4,500km above the Earth.
Experts suggest that this missile, if fired on a more conventional lower trajectory, could have a maximum range of some 13,000km, putting all of the continental United States in North Korea's sights.
However, there remain doubts as to whether this missile could successfully carry and deliver a heavy warhead for such a distance, and whether North Korea has the expertise to accurately hit a target.
The apparent successes of all these tests, in contrast to the multiple failures of the earlier Musudan missiles, have raised questions as to how North Korea's missile programme has improved so rapidly.
Michael Elleman from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) suggests that Pyongyang may have acquired high-performance liquid-propellant engines from illicit networks in Russia and Ukraine.
Pyongyang has also previously displayed two other purported ICBMs, known as the KN-08 and KN-14. Neither has yet been tested, and the relationship between them and the Hwasong's 12 and 14 is not yet clear.
American military intelligence also believes that North Korea has now successfully miniaturised a nuclear warhead to fit inside a missile.

North Korea's 3 September nuclear test was by far the biggest of six nuclear tests carried out since 2006, analysts concluded.
The test triggered a 6.3 magnitude earthquake, ten times more powerful than that recorded in a previous test in September 2016.
Estimates of the latest device's explosive power, or yield, ranged from 100-370 kilotons. A yield of 100 kilotons would make the test six times more power than bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
North Korea claims this test was its first thermonuclear weapon - the most potent form of nuclear weapon where an atomic detonation is boosted by a secondary fusion process to produce a far bigger blast.
Pyongyang started its nuclear programme in the 1980s. Its first nuclear test - of a device yielding a suspected 0.7kt - was held in 2006.

North Korea has one of the largest standing armies in the world, but much of its equipment is old and obsolete.
Despite this, its conventional forces could still inflict massive damage on South Korea should war break out.
While the official military budget is unknown, a regime policy known as 'songun' prioritises spending on the armed forces over all other aspects of government.
In addition to a standing army of more than one million, and estimated reserves of some five million, North Korea also has around 200,000 special forces troops.
These special forces could be expected to infiltrate south in any conflict, potentially exploiting a semi-secret network of 20-25 large tunnels which span the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ),  emerging behind South Korean and American forward lines.
A further potent threat comes from thousands of North Korea artillery pieces and rocket launchers deployed along the border, many dug into reinforced concrete positions.
From here the North could unleash crude yet devastating firepower on South Korea, including the capital Seoul, which is well within range.
Chemical weapons could also be used. In 2012 the South Korean government assessed that North Korea could have between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of chemical weapons, potentially one of the largest stockpiles on Earth.
While South Korea would rely heavily on American assistance in the event of war, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has recently signalled he plans to increase military spending.
The United States has had a military presence on the Korean Peninsula since the Korean War, and today South Korea has the third highest deployment of American troops anywhere in the world.
Some 28,000 US troops are stationed across South Korea, the IISS estimates, including almost 9,000 air force personnel . In addition, the US has some 300 M1 Abrams tanks and armoured vehicles deployed.
The US has also installed its THAAD missile defence system at Seongju in South Korea, which would be used shoot down North Korean short and medium range missiles in the event of war.
In the wider region, Japan hosts more US forces than any other nation on Earth with some 47,050 deployed, according to the IISS, the majority being naval personnel.
Yokosuka in Japan is the headquarters of the US Seventh Fleet, which typically has around 20 ships deployed, including the only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier strike group led by the USS Ronald Reagan.
Significant US forces are also present on the island of Guam, which is sometimes described as a ""permanent aircraft carrier"".
Andersen Air Base on Guam hosts the 36th Wing, which operates America's three strategic bomber types the B-52, B1-B Lancer, and B2-Spirit.
In March, it was reported that the US Air Force had deployed an additional 12 B-52s and 12 B-1B aircraft to reinforce its presence on Guam.
North Korea has threatened to fire missiles at the waters around Guam, in response it says to the US flying bomber aircraft over the Korean Peninsula.",0
"(Before It's News)Scientists have identified a key chemical within the ‘memory’ region of the brain that allows us to suppress unwanted thoughts, helping explain why people who suffer from disorders such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and schizophrenia often experience persistent intrusive thoughts when these circuits go awry.
We are sometimes confronted with reminders of unwanted thoughts — thoughts about unpleasant memories, images or worries. When this happens, the thought may be retrieved, making us thinkabout it again even though we prefer not to. While being reminded in this way may not be a problem when our thoughts are positive, if the topic was unpleasant or traumatic, our thoughts may be very negative, worrying or ruminating about what happened, taking us back to the event.
“Our ability to control our thoughts is fundamental to our wellbeing,” explains Professor Michael Anderson from the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, which recently transferred to the University of Cambridge. “When this capacity breaks down, it causes some of the most debilitating symptoms of psychiatric diseases: intrusive memories, images, hallucinations, ruminations, and pathological and persistent worries. These are all key symptoms of mental illnesses such as PTSD, schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety.”

These are all key symptoms of mental illnesses such as PTSD, schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety.”
Professor Anderson likens our ability to intervene and stop ourselves retrieving particular memories and thoughts to stopping a physical action. “We wouldn’t be able to survive without controlling our actions,” he says. “We have lots of quick reflexes that are often useful, but we sometimes need to control these actions and stop them from happening. There must be a similar mechanism for helping us stop unwanted thoughts from occurring.”
A region at the front of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex is known to play a key role in controlling our actions and has more recently been shown to play a similarly important role in stopping our thoughts. The prefrontal cortex acts as a master regulator, controlling other brain regions – the motor cortex for actions and the hippocampus for memories.
In research published today in the journal Nature Communications, a team of scientists led by Dr Taylor Schmitz and Professor Anderson used a task known as the ‘Think/No-Think’ procedure to identify a significant new brain process that enables the prefrontal cortex to successfully inhibit our thoughts.
In the task, participants learn to associate a series of words with a paired, but otherwise unconnected, word, for example ordeal/roach and moss/north. In the next stage, participants are asked to recall the associated word if the cue is green or to suppress it if the cue is red; in other words, when shown ‘ordeal’ in red, they are asked to stare at the word but to stop themselves thinking about the associated thought ‘roach’.
Using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the researchers were able to observe what was happening within key regions of the brain as the participants tried to inhibit their thoughts. Spectroscopy enabled the researchers to measure brain chemistry, and not just brain activity, as is usually done in imaging studies.
Professor Anderson, Dr Schmitz and colleagues showed that the ability to inhibit unwanted thoughts relies on a neurotransmitter – a chemical within the brain that allows messages to pass between nerve cells – known as GABA. GABA is the main ‘inhibitory’ neurotransmitter in the brain, and its release by one nerve cell can suppress activity in other cells to which it is connected. Anderson and colleagues discovered that GABA concentrations within the hippocampus – a key area of the brain involved in memory – predict people’s ability to block the retrieval process and prevent thoughts and memories from returning.
“What’s exciting about this is that now we’re getting very specific,” he explains. “Before, we could only say ‘this part of the brain acts on that part’, but now we can say which neurotransmitters are likely important – and as a result, infer the role of inhibitory neurons – in enabling us to stop unwanted thoughts.”
“Where previous research has focused on the prefrontal cortex – the command centre – we’ve shown that this is an incomplete picture. Inhibiting unwanted thoughts is as much about the cells within the hippocampus – the ‘boots on the ground’ that receive commands from the prefrontal cortex. If an army’s foot-soldiers are poorly equipped, then its commanders’ orders cannot be implemented well.”
The researchers found that even within his sample of healthy young adults, people with less hippocampal GABA (less effective ‘foot-soldiers’) were less able to suppress hippocampal activity by the prefrontal cortex—and as a result much worse at inhibiting unwanted thoughts.
The discovery may answer one of the long-standing questions about schizophrenia. Research has shown that people affected by schizophrenia have ‘hyperactive’ hippocampi, which correlates with intrusive symptoms such as hallucinations. Post-mortem studies have revealed that the inhibitory neurons (which use GABA) in the hippocampi of these individuals are compromised, possibly making it harder for the prefrontal cortex to regulate activity in this structure. This suggests that the hippocampus is failing to inhibit errant thoughts and memories, which may be manifest as hallucinations.
According to Dr Schmitz: “The environmental and genetic influences that give rise to hyperactivity in the hippocampus might underlie a range of disorders with intrusive thoughts as a common symptom.”
In fact, studies have shown that elevated activity in the hippocampus is seen in a broad range of conditions such as PTSD, anxiety and chronic depression, all of which include a pathological inability to control thoughts – such as excessive worrying or rumination.
While the study does not examine any immediate treatments, Professor Anderson believes it could offer a new approach to tackling intrusive thoughts in these disorders. “Most of the focus has been on improving functioning of the prefrontal cortex,” he says, “but our study suggests that if you could improve GABA activity within the hippocampus, this may help people to stop unwanted and intrusive thoughts.”

"Former Pussycat Dolls memberKaya Jones has spoken out on the Hollywood sex abuse scandal to reveal that the pop group created as a ""prostitutionring"" for record industry elites. The pop singer says she walked away from a multi-million dollar record deal and guaranteed success and fame due to the overwhelmingsexual abuse she suffered.In a scathing statement, she said that her ""handlers"" forced her and other band members to have sex with ""whoever they say"".Jones is the latest in a long line of accusers to step forward and expose Hollywoodoligarchs for sexual assault, rape, and even child abuse.“My truth. I wasn’t in a girl group. I was in a prostitution ring,” Jones wrote on Twitter.“Oh and we happened to sing and be famous, while everyone who owned us made the money.”
NTDreports: Jones was a member of the Pussycat Dolls from 2003 to 2005. In her messages, she says she was forced to sleep with anyone her handlers ordered her to.“To be apart of the team you must be a team player,” Jones wrote. “Meaning sleep with whoever they say.”If the girls refused, the people who she did not name used various ways to coerce them, including turning them out or hooking them on drugs.“How bad was it?” Kaya asked. “Bad enough that I walked away from my dreams, bandmates and a 13 million dollar record deal. We knew we were going to #1.”Kaya also said that she told Hollywood executives about the problem in 2004. She then went to the press in 2005-2006, and again in 2011, but her story was never told. Jones, now 33, was discovered by R. Kelly when she was 13 and signed on to his record label. In 2002, police searched R. Kelly’s home and found images of him“involved in sexual conduct with” a “female minor”. That year Kelly was indicted on 21 counts of child pornography, but the case was dropped because police could not prove sufficient probable cause for the search warrants.Jones was signed by Capitol Records when she was 16 and became a member of the Pussycat Dolls in 2013. She believes many victims of sexual abuse have not come forward because they have been threatened.“Why don’t we report it?” Kaya asked. “Because we are all abused! I personally have been warned if I tell I will … you know end up dead or no more career”

Kaya also referred to an ominous “den mother,” who she said was responsible for the suicide of a girl in another band, which the unnamed woman was in charge of. A member of the G. R.L. girlband took her own life in 2014. The Pussycat Dolls and G.R.L. were both founded by Robin Antin, according toPerez Hilton.“I want the den mother from hell to confess why another one of her girl group girls committed suicide?” Kaya asked. “Tell the public how you mentally broke us.”Kaya indicated that she has kept a diary of the events she witnessed during the years of abuse.“Oh yes I kept a journal with timelines,” she wrote.Jones was born in Toronto and lives in Los Angeles. She was at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 when a gunman carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.But she refers to her past in the music industry as a silent war zone.“That’s why I have so much respect for our military. I’ve been through war,” Jones wrote. “But my scars you can’t see. At least real war is honest.”In her messages she is calling out her abusers, saying that many of the children they scarred have now become adults.“The children you messed with that survived the abuse, we are adults now,” she writes. “Are you ready old ones to fight? Cause you all are looking mighty old.”Based on Jones’s messages, it appears she is not the only survivor who made it out and is ready to speak.“Tried to silence us, made us stronger,” Jones writes. “Tried to drug us, but we were wide awake. Tried to blacklist us, but fans followed. We aren’t kids anymore”Jones, who is now a solo artist, said that she made her past abuse public because she wants to protect other women.“Because I’ll be damned if I’ll sit back & watch them take advantage of the public & other young women again,” she writes. “No reunion on my watch.”",1
"Millions of Americans converged on a narrow corridor stretching from Oregon to South Carolina to watch the moon blot out the midday sun Monday for a wondrous couple of minutes in the first total solar eclipse to sweep coast to coast in 99 years.
Veteran eclipse watchers warned the uninitiated to get ready to be blown away.
* How to stream the American solar eclipse of 2017
* Bill Nye on an eclipse's beauty and the wonder of science
Planetariums and museums posted ""Sold out of eclipse glasses"" on their front doors. Signs along highways reminded motorists of ""Solar Eclipse Monday,"" while cars bore the message ""Eclipse or bust.""
With 200 million people within a day's drive of the path of totality, towns and parks braced for monumental crowds. It's expected to be the most observed, most studied and most photographed eclipse ever. Not to mention the most festive, what with all the parties.
In Salem, Oregon, a field outside the state fairgrounds was transformed into a campground in advance of an eclipse-watching party for 8,500.
""It's one of those 'check the box' kind of things in life,"" said Hilary O'Hollaren, who drove 30 miles from Portland with her two teenagers and a tent, plus a couple friends.
Astronomers consider a full solar eclipse the grandest of cosmic spectacles.
The Earth, moon and sun line up perfectly every one to three years, briefly turning day into night for a sliver of the planet. But these sights normally are in no man's land, like the vast Pacific or the poles. This will be the first eclipse of the social media era to pass through such a heavily populated area.
The moon hasn't thrown this much shade at the U. S. since 1918. That was the country's last coast-to-coast total eclipse.
In fact, the U. S. mainland hasn't seen a total solar eclipse since 1979 -- and even then, only five states in the Northwest experienced total darkness before the eclipse veered in Canada.
Monday's total eclipse will cast a shadow that will race through 14 states, entering near Lincoln City, Oregon, at 1:16 p.m. ET, moving diagonally across the heartland and then exiting near Charleston, South Carolina, at 2:47 p.m. ET.
* Amateur photographers will help bring the solar eclipse to the world
The path will cut 2,600 miles across the land and will be just 60 to 70 miles wide.
Mostly clear skies beckoned along much of the route, according to the National Weather Service.
Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois will see the longest stretch of darkness: 2 minutes and 44 seconds.
All of North America will get at least a partial eclipse. Central America and the top of South America will also see the moon cover part of the sun.
NASA and other scientists will be watching and analyzing from telescopes the ground and in orbit, the International Space Station, airplanes and scores of high-altitude balloons, which will beam back live video. Citizen scientists will monitor animal and plant behavior as daylight turns into twilight and the temperature drops.
NASA's associate administrator for science missions, Thomas Zurbuchen, took to the skies for a dry run Sunday. He will usher in the eclipse over the Pacific Coast from a NASA plane.
""Can't wait for the cosmic moment Mon morning,"" he tweeted.
Near Victoria, British Columbia, where 91 percent of the sun will be eclipsed, science and math teacher Clayton Uyeda is planning to watch from a ferry along with his wife. He said he is ""expecting to have a real sense of connection with the heavens.""
He has similarly lofty hopes for his students if they can bring themselves to look up at the sky instead of down at their electronic devices.
Scientists everywhere agree with Uyeda: Put the phones and cameras down and enjoy the greatest natural show on Earth with your own (protected) eyes.
The only time it's safe to look directly without protective eyewear is during totality, when the sun is 100 percent covered. Otherwise, keep the solar specs on or use pinhole projectors that can cast an image of the eclipse into a box.
The next total solar eclipse in the U. S. will be in 2024. The next coast-to-coast one will not be until 2045.
Monday's event will take place in the middle of the workday, which may cost employers as much as $694 million in lost productivity, according to global outplacement and coaching firm Challenger, Grey & Christmas, which analyzed wage and employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
States and cities in the path of the eclipse could suffer productivity losses of almost $200 million. Experts are warning businesses to expect increased absenteeism as millions of people are projected to travel tosee the eclipseor take a break from work, which will cause productivity to plummet.
Even companies located in areas with a partial eclipse may have a ""manic Monday."" Challenger, Grey, estimates that the eclipse will cost the Chicago area $28 million, for example. Experts are encouraging employers to make the best of the situation by holding viewing parties and other team-building activities.
""A loss of productivity does not necessarily mean that good things cannot come out of this eclipse,"" said Andrew Challenger, vice president at Challenger, Grey, in a statement. ""By considering how this event may impact employee morale, companies can turn this potential monetary loss to a gain when it comes to employee satisfaction.""

"DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) — Gun Runner, the top older horse on the East Coast, is the slight 9/5 favorite for the $6 million Breeders' Cup Classic on Saturday at Del Mar.
He breaks from the No. 5 post while defending champion Arrogate starts from the rail as the 2-1 second choice.
Del Mar is hosting the $28 million, 13-race Breeders' Cup for the first time. The season-ending championships open with four races on Friday followed by nine, including the Classic, on Saturday.
Gun Runner arrives on a three-race winning streak, all Grade 1 stakes, for trainer Steve Asmussen. The 4-year-old posted dominant victories in the Stephen Foster at Churchill Downs and the Whitney and Woodward Stakes at Saratoga. His last defeat was to Arrogate in Dubai.
Arrogate, the world's all-time leading money earner with $17.3 million, is one of four Classic runners trained by Bob Baffert. He also sends out Collected (6-1), Mubtaahij (12-1) and Travers winner West Coast (6-1) in the richest race of the weekend.
The Classic will be shown live in prime time on NBC.
Post positions were drawn Monday afternoon with actress Bo Derek assisting for the Classic and the Distaff.
Arrogate, has been vulnerable since winning the Dubai World Cup in March. He was fourth in the San Diego Handicap and second by a half length to stablemate Collected in the Pacific Classic.
Mike Smith, Arrogate's rider, said the colt is ""training like it,"" when asked to compare his current fitness compared to last year when he beat California Chrome by a half length.
""It took a while to get his legs back,"" Smith said.
Arrogate tries to become the first horse to win consecutive Classics since Tiznow in 2000-01.
The field will not include any of this year's Triple Crown winners: Always Dreaming (Kentucky Derby), Cloud Computing (Preakness) and Tapwrit (Belmont Stakes).
Baffert is going for an unprecedented fourth straight victory in the Classic, after winning the last three years with Bayern, Triple Crown winner American Pharoah and Arrogate. Regardless of the outcome, Baffert will set a Classic record as the first trainer to saddle four horses in the race.
Churchill (15-1), Gunnevera (30-1), Pavel (20-1) and a trio of 30-1 shots--War Decree, War Story and Win the Space-- complete the Classic field.
Stellar Wind (5-2) returns for a third straight try in the $2 million Distaff, the marque race on the Friday program. She was second in 2015 and fourth last year.
The 5-year-old mare trained by John Sadler is a perfect 3 for 3 in 2017.
""She's been a great mare,"" Sadler said. ""She's done everything we've asked this year. We're excited. She's ready and we've got our fingers crossed.""
The road to next year's Triple Crown starts Saturday with the $2 million Juvenile for 2-year-olds where Bolt d'Oro looms the 9-5 favorite for trainer Mick Ruis from post No. 11.
The son of Medaglia d'Oro is 3 for 3 following a 7 -length romp in the Front Runner Stakes at Santa Anita.
The Irish-bred Ulysses is one of Europe's top contenders in this Breeders' Cup as the 7/2 favorite in the $4 million Turf contested one race before the Classic.
Fourth in the Turf last year, Ulysses has captured three Group 1 races in England this season.

"Kirsten Saenz Tobey and Kristin Groos Richmond are Citi clients of mine and the co-founders of Revolution Foods, a company that is tackling the challenge of the more than 20 million Americans who lack access to healthy food. I sat down with them recently to talk about the growth of their business and the importance of building a team from within the cities they serve.
Q: So tell us, how did you two meet? What’s the story behind Revolution Foods?
Kristin Groos Richmond: We met on the first day of business school and within our first year we started crafting the business plan for Revolution Foods. Both of us had a passion for food and nutrition, so we saw what an opportunity there was, both from an impact standpoint and from a business-building standpoint.
Kirsten Saenz Tobey: We started seven-and-a-half years ago with very humble roots as most entrepreneurs do. Revolution Foods began with three schools, preparing about 500 meals a day out of a 500-square-foot kitchen in Oakland, California. We hand-produced every meal — we made our homemade turkey sandwiches, rolled our quesadillas, packed our fruit — and delivered each one to schools every day in one truck that we leased.
Q: I met you both as your business really began to expand, first to more schools and then to new product lines available at grocery stores. What has that been like?
Kirsten Saenz Tobey: From that original kitchen, we have now expanded to seven culinary centers around the country, and we are now serving over one million meals a week. It’s a tremendous undertaking and a very complex operational business. It’s also one that has allowed us to create more than 1,000 jobs in urban communities, which is one of the things that we treasure most about Revolution Foods.
Kristin Groos Richmond: We knew early on that we wanted to have a large-scale impact and to provide as many families in America as possible access to high-quality food. That came first in the form of expanding to new geographic areas: serving more schools and more families through our school meals program. But very quickly, we also realized that teachers, parents and students wanted to see our food on store shelves, so we recently launched our meal kits, which are now available in stores nationwide.
Q: Kirsten, you mentioned the pride you feel in creating jobs for your teammates. Tell us more about that.
Kirsten Saenz Tobey: When we do town halls with our team, we always say we’ve done almost every job in the company and really respect the folks who are working at Revolution Foods in cities across the country. It feels good to have grown up with the idea, to have created it step-by-step, and most importantly to have built an incredible team to help us scale. One of the things we’re most proud of is watching our teammates grow and turn jobs into careers.
Kristin Groos Richmond: People come in for an interview because they’re looking for a job, but then they join the company because they believe in what we’re doing. They stay because they have opportunities to grow and to contribute. It’s really the ability for someone to come in at an entry level and earn a sustainable income while gaining an ownership stake in the company, and then be managing a team within four to five years with hard work, solid coaching and great performance.
Q: So how does all of this investment you make in your team tie back to your goal of providing access to high quality food to the communities you serve?
Kristin Groos Richmond: Both of us are passionately focused on making sure that we recruit a world-class team in every community that we’re serving. That often includes the parents and even grandparents of the kids who are in our schools and increasingly also in the urban neighborhoods where our products are sold in stores.
Kirsten Saenz Tobey: When you hire directly from the communities you serve, you’re able to employ the most invested and passionate people about the food that they’re serving every day. We believe that we are having an impact on the health of the economies in America’s cities by creating good jobs for people that lead to great careers.
Q: So why do you think a bank like Citi has decided to work with a company like Revolution Foods?
Kirsten Saenz Tobey: There are incredible details involved in planning our culinary centers, buying and financing that equipment, making sure that we have the right setup operationally, the right ordering process with our schools and the support needed for our school relationships. There are also tremendous challenges and opportunities in expanding to a new business model and product line and entering distribution relationships with national retailers. It was clear from the start that Citi wanted to help us to accomplish our vision – through more than just financing but also support and guidance – and that our vision is one that is very aligned with Citi’s mission of enabling progress.
Kristin Groos Richmond: Working with Citi has put fuel in the tank for us and our team. It’s given us an absolute turbo boost in terms of how many jobs we can create, how many students and moms and dads and families we can reach, and how many communities we can be in across the country. Like us, I think, Citi believes that by building a strong business, we can continue to drive change in cities across America.

"It appears Bernie Sanders should really stop worryingabout what others are doing with their lives and focus more on what his own spouse is doing.
But that wouldn’t be the socialist way, now would it?
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) isinvestigatingJane Sanders, of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, over her seemingly shady role in thefraudulent acquisition of nearly $7 million in tax-exempt bonds when she was the president of Burlington College.
An extremely ambitious expansion and fundraising effort spearheaded by Jane Sanders ended up bankrupting the tiny, private and now-defunct school in Burlington, Vermont. It closed its doors — suddenly and permanently — in 2016.
Emails obtained through an open records request by The Vermont Journalism Trust reveal that FBI agents and the US Attorney’s Office in Vermont have been analyzing Burlington College records for over a year. Also, the feds have subpoenaed at least one former Burlington College employee.
That employee, former Burlington College dean of operations Coralee Holm, told The Vermont Journalism Trust that FBI agents questioned her about the fundraising activities related to the expansion.
Jane Sanders, who was the president of tiny Burlington College from 2004 until 2011, masterminded the expansion plan, which would have more than doubled the enrollment of the school (from about 200 full-time students to over 400). The plan required the college take on $10 million in debt to finance the purchase of an expansive new campus.
The real estate purchase backfired massively, leading to Sanders’s departure from the college and its eventual collapse.

Macy's shares tumbled more than 9 percent after the market's close Wednesday after it posted disappointing holiday sales and released the locations of 68 of the 100 stores it plans to close as it looks to turn around its performance.
Macy's comparable sales fell 2.1 percent in November and December, which was at the low end of its previous guidance. It maintained its 2016 comparable sales guidance of a 2.5 percent to 3 percent decline, but expects full-year diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.95 to $3.10. It had previously been expecting $3.15 to $3.40.
Macy's outgoing Chairman and CEO Terry Lundgren said the company expects ""our 2017 change in comparable sales to be relatively consistent with our November/December sales trend.""
Macy's shares recently changed hands at $32.60, down $3.24, or 9 percent.
As part of Wednesday's announcement Macy's said it will eliminate layers of management to cut costs and make more agile decisions. It also will work to reduce other non-payroll costs. As a result of these steps, the company estimates its work force will be cut by 6,200.
Another 3,900 workers will be displaced by the store closures and some of these employees could be reassigned.
The store closures are an attempt to reverse the downward slide in sales at its established shops, and they make good on a promise from August, when the department store chain said it would close a chunk of stores to focus on its best-performing locations and its website.
As part of a strategy to streamline its portfolio, Macy's moves will save the company an estimated $550 million a year starting in 2017. The company will use these proceeds to invest an additional $250 million in its digital business, as well as the growth of its Bluemercury beauty shops, Macy's Backstage off-price stores, and China.
The company expects to record about $250 million of charges, or 50 cents per share, in fourth quarter 2016. These charges were not previously included in its earnings forecast and are in addition to the $249 million recorded in the second quarter as an estimate of asset impairment and other charges primarily related to 2016 store closings.
Fellow department store chain Kohl's also lowered its forecast for 2016 amid soft holiday sales, and now expects diluted earnings per share to between $2.92 and $2.97, short of its prior estimate of $3.12 to $3.32. Its comparable sales also fell 2.1 percent in November and December.
The weak performance at the department stores came despite recent reports that the industry's holiday season was shaping up to top previous estimates. Much of that success was driven by strong online sales growth and a burst of last-minute purchases.
Of the 68 stores Macy's is closing, three were shuttered mid-year, 63 will be closed in early spring, and two will be closed in the middle of the year. Three other locations were sold, or will be sold, and are being leased back. (A full list of planned store closures is below.)
As a result of the 63 store closures in early 2017, along with the three closed in the middle of 2016, the company's 2017 sales will take a roughly $575 million hit, the company said. That's after factoring in the sales it expected to retain in nearby stores and on the web.
The company will close about 30 additional stores over the next few years as leases or operating covenants expire or sale transactions are completed, the company said.
""We are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape, as well as monetizing locations with highly valued real estate,"" Lundgren said, in a press release. ""These are never easy decisions, and we are committed to treating associates affected by these closings with respect and transparency.""
Meanwhile, Macy's plans to open some 50 new Backstage locations inside existing Macy's stores, and about 50 Bluemercury specialty stores. Those shops will be both freestanding and within existing Macy's stores.
Internationally, a new Bloomingdale's store will open Kuwait this spring, and new Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores are will open in United Arab Emirates in 2018.
Under pressure by activist investor Starboard, Macy's has been taking steps to make money from its vast real estate empire.
In October, the retailer said it had sold five of its stores to General Growth Properties, including four that were offloaded in the third quarter for $46 million.
One month later, it said it had signed a contract to sell its men's flagship in San Francisco's Union Square for $250 million. At that time, it also disclosed that it had signed a contract to sell its downtown Portland, Oregon, store for $54 million. As part of the latest round of closures, Macy's said it has entered into an agreement to sell its downtown Minneapolis store to 601W Companies.
The retailer currently has 730 Macy's stores.
Macy's announcement comes just hours after Seritage Growth Properties, the real estate investment trust that was spun off from Sears, said the department store chain exercised its right to terminate the leases on 19 unprofitable stores. They are scheduled to close in April.
Seritage made a similar announcement in September, when Sears terminated the leases on 17 unprofitable stores. Those locations were slated to close in January.
Final clearance sales at the following Macy's stores closing in early 2017 will begin on Monday, January 9, and run for approximately eight to 12 weeks (with the exception of Lancaster Mall*, where final clearance sales are already in progress):
Mall at Tuttle Crossing (furniture/home/kids/men's), Dublin, OH (227,000 square feet, opened in 2003, 52 associates)
Stores sold (or to be sold) and leased back
These stores have been or will be sold, and Macy's will continue to operate them on leases from the owners:",0
"Puerto Rico, already trying to dig itself out of a historic financial crisis, is now facing a direct hit by a major hurricane that could destroy any progress the U. S. territory has made under a year-old economic rehab plan ─ and set it back further.
Hurricane Maria is forecast to hit Puerto Rico early Wednesday, testing the local government's ability to respond to a humanitarian disaster. While the Caribbean island of 3.4 million people is accustomed to tropical storms, it hasn't been hit by a Category 4 or 5 hurricane since 1928.
Gov. Ricardo Rossello announced Monday that he had declared a state of emergency and urged people living in flood-prone areas to evacuate.
The territory's infrastructure has gone neglected for years, and in July its power company defaulted on a debt-restructuring deal. When Hurricane Irma skirted Puerto Rico this month, more than 1 million people were left without power, and many of them could remain in the dark for months, officials have said.
""If Irma shook us up a little bit and gave us a rude awakening as to just how precarious the situation was, something like a Category 5 storm will have us without power for a time that is unimaginable,"" said Philipe Schoene Roura, executive editor of the San Juan-based newspaper Caribbean Business.
His newspaper published an article in early September in which the head of the power utility said a strong storm could keep the the island in the dark for weeks.
Edwin Melendez, director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York, said such widespread outages would affect millions of people and deal double blows to communities in the island's mountainous interior whose water systems depend on electricity. Two sectors of the Puerto Rican economy that have shown signs of life, tourism and agriculture, would also suffer.
""It’s a grim picture no matter how you slice it,"" Melendez said.
An extended recovery could divert public resources and labor away from economic rebuilding efforts. Puerto Rico, a decade into a recession, is unable to pay its debts, which led to a plan, called Promesa, in which the U. S. government effectively put the territory into bankruptcy protection, with a court-appointed board supervising its finances. The board has emphasized a reduction in government spending.
Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez, D-N. Y., said in a statement that she had asked the Department of Energy and Promesa's financial oversight and management board for help ""shoring up the Island’s ailing energy infrastructure.""
Puerto Rico is also in the midst of a housing crisis, with thousands losing their homes to foreclosure, and many becoming homeless. The local unemployment rate is 10 percent, more than double the U. S. rate.
""The storm compounds already existing problems on the island,"" said Deepak Lamba-Nieves, research director at the Center for a New Economy in San Juan. ""From that perspective, it’s a really tense moment and one that places Puerto Rico in a more precarious situation than before.""",0

We don’t like to bring you bad news, but when your dog lick the face can bring you serious health problems.
So, why is it so bad? You thought the dog’s mouth cleaner than human? No! That is just a myth, people. The truth is that dogs eat garbage, someone else’s poop and they do not brush their teeth like us.
This means that they can pass a variety of dangerous bacteria on us, when we get  licked on the face.You don’t believe us? There are numerous examples when the dogs in this way transferred tuberculosis on their owners. In 2013, child was infected with TBC by family dog. The child, who was under 10 years old, fully recovered, but the dog was put to sleep.
Another reason to avoid its saliva is because the pathogen Porfiromonas peel can be transmitted from dogs to humans. This pathogen causes gum disease at dogs and gingivitis at humans. Dogs can also give us a nasty infection if you allow them to lick your wounds!
If these reasons aren’t enough, just think of all “wonderful and beautiful” thing in which your dogs pushes it’s nose (in this case the mouth) …
We’re not saying that you should get rid of your pet or that you should stop giving him the love and tenderness that he certainly as your best friend deserves, just try to keep his tongue in his mouth.
Please take this information’s very seriously and share them with other dog owners.

"DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) — Arrogate and Gun Runner square off again in the $6 million Classic on Saturday, the marquee event on the second day of the Breeders' Cup, which is being run for the first-time at Del Mar.
The 13-race, season-ending championships started with four races Friday. Nine more will be run on Day 2.
The event culminates with the Classic, the biggest event in the history of the seaside track north of San Diego.
Arrogate, the defending champion, is winless since the $10 million Dubai World Cup in March. He'll need to be in peak form to handle Gun Runner, the 9-5 favorite.
Arrogate, the 2-1 second choice, is one of four Classic entries for Baffert, who has won the race the last three years with Bayern in 2014 and Triple Crown winner American Pharoah in 2015.
The all-time richest horse with earnings of $17.3 million, Arrogate followed the Classic victory with triumphs in the $12 million Pegasus World Cup and in Dubai.
The 4-year-old gray is winless since his return from the Middle East. He was a badly beaten fourth as the 1-20 favorite in the San Diego Handicap, and second to stablemate Collected in the Pacific Classic in August over the same Del Mar track.
""I think a lot of it is the way I prepared him,"" Baffert said. ""I take the blame for him getting beat the first time. The second time, it looked like he wasn't going to run and all of a sudden he started running at the end.
""I think he should run well.""
Arrogate beat Gun Runner by 2 1/4 lengths in Dubai. It's been a dramatically different story since then. Gun Runner reeled off dominant wins in the Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs and in the Whitney and Woodward Stakes at Saratoga.
Trainer Steve Asmussen, who won the 2007 Classic with Curlin, marvels at the resilient 4-year-old colt.
""This is a testament to Gun Runner and the year that he's put together,"" Asmussen said. ""You look at what he's done this year and it's very impressive. His inner fortitude, his strength and his confidence has allowed him to do it.""
Baffert conceded: ""Gun Runner is the horse to beat.""
In addition to Arrogate, bidding to join Tiznow (2000-01) as the only consecutive Classic winners, Baffert sends out Mubtaahij (12-1), Travers winner West Coast (6-1) and Collected (6-1).
Leading Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien has two runners in the Classic: War Decree (30-1) and Churchill (15-1).
Completing the Classic field are Pavel (20-1) and pair of 30-1 shots: Win the Space and Gunnevera.
— Europe sends a strong contingent to the $4 million Turf, the second-richest stakes of the weekend. Early 7-2 favorite Ulysses was scratched upon the recommendation of the track veterinarians on Saturday night. Defending champion Highland Reel will likely be the new favorite.
— The road to next year's Triple Crown starts with the $2 million Juvenile. Bolt d'Oro (9-5) is unbeaten in three starts, and likely one of the shortest prices of the weekend.
— Moonshine Memories (7-2) puts her 3-for-3 record on the line in the $2 million Juvenile Fillies.
— At five furlongs, the $1 million Turf Sprint is the shortest Cup race. It should be an all-out scramble with filly Lady Aurelia (5-2) favored to beat the boys.
— Unique Bella (9-5) has reeled off five straight wins heading into the $1 million Filly and Mare Sprint.
— Lady Eli (5-2) has overcome laminitis, a sometimes fatal hoof infection, to resume her brilliant career. The Filly and Mare Turf is her last race before retirement and a deep spot against 13 seasoned rivals.
— Defrong (5-2) defends his title in the $1.5 million Sprint against some of the fastest horses in the world.
— European star Ribchester (7-2) is 3-2-1 in six starts this year. Victories in Group 1 stakes England and France make him the one to beat in the $2 million Mile.

"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has reviewed plans to fire missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam but will hold off, state media said.
Although prepared for ""the enveloping fire at Guam"", the North said it would watch what ""the foolish Yankees"" do before taking a decision.
Last week's threat against Guam escalated the sharp rhetoric being exchanged between the two sides.
This latest report points to a pause in the increasingly bitter war of words.
South Korea's President Moon Jae-in meanwhile has urged the US not to launch an attack on the Korean peninsula without its consent, saying ""no-one may decide to take military action without the consent"" of the South.
In a separate incident in Guam, an emergency alert was broadcast in error on a radio station warning residents of ""civil danger"" on the island.
The Guam Homeland Security Office said the alert, which went out shortly after midnight on Tuesday, was a result of human error and would not happen again.
In a statement posted on Facebook, the office said that the broadcast was ""an unscheduled test"" and urged both residents and visitors to ""remain calm"".
The report on state news agency KCNA said Kim Jong-un ""examined the plan for a long time"" and discussed it with senior military officials.
The commander of North Korea's strategic force was now merely waiting for orders ""after rounding off the preparations for the enveloping fire at Guam"".
But, crucially, the report also said that Mr Kim would watch the US before making any decision, signalling an apparent deceleration in the provocative rhetoric.
Correspondents say that after days of menacing threats it might seem that Kim Jong-un could be in the mood to finally hit the pause button -  but in a nation as secretive as North Korea, one can never be sure.
Analysts say it could simply mean Pyongyang is not fully ready to launch an attack on Guam, so it could just be buying more time.
South Korea and China - North Korea's closest ally - have been urging calm and a renewed push for diplomatic resolutions.
On Tuesday South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the US should not act unilaterally. The two countries' defence agreement states that they must ""consult together"" when either is threatened.
Questions are being raised about whether America would need South Korea's approval to strike back at North Korea if Guam was attacked.
According to international law, and the military agreement between South Korea and the US, it does not. So why would President Moon say no military action could be taken without Seoul's ""consent""?
Professor Hwee Rhak Park from Kookmin University says it might be a gesture towards liberals in South Korea - who are the president's main supporters - to show that the government is in control of the situation.
South Korea is often criticised by its northern neighbour for being a puppet of the US, so this could also be a veiled message to America to tone down the rhetoric.
Whatever he means, the South Korean president's stance has been quite clear from the start. He wants a diplomatic resolution, and has reiterated that he's open to talks with Pyongyang.
China's foreign ministry on Monday reiterated its ""suspension for suspension proposal"", where North Korea stops its missile tests in exchange for a freeze on military exercises by the US and South Korea.
Defence Secretary James Mattis earlier warned that any attack could quickly escalate into war, and if Pyongyang fired a missile towards Guam, ""then it's game on"".
He told reporters that the US military would defend the country ""from any attack, at any time and from any quarter"".
He also sought to reassure residents of Guam, home to US military bases and about 160,000 people, that they were well-protected and if a missile was fired, ""we'll take it out"".
It comes after President Trump threatened Pyongyang with ""fire and fury"", saying: ""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded.""
The governor of Guam, Eddie Baza Calvo, has praised Mr Trump's rhetoric, saying it ensured the US position was clearly understood.
* The 541sq km (209 sq miles) volcanic and coral island in the Pacific between the Philippines and Hawaii.
* It is a ""non-incorporated"" US territory, with a population of about 163,000.
* That means people born in Guam are US citizens, have an elected governor and House Representative, but cannot vote for a president in US national elections.
* US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more.
* It was a key US base in World War Two, and remains a vital staging post for US operations, giving access to potential flashpoints like the South China Sea, the Koreas and the Taiwan Straits.
Over the past year North Korea has stepped up its missile tests, despite repeated warnings from all quarters.
The state had already conducted five nuclear tests, but then in July it launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) claiming it now had the ability to hit the US mainland.
The UN then approved fresh economic sanctions against North Korea to pressure it into giving up its nuclear ambitions. The measures aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third.
Pyongyang reacted furiously to the new sanctions, calling them a ""violent violation of our sovereignty"" and warning that the US would ""pay a price"".
Last week, US media reported that North Korea had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles.
Although not confirmed, this was seen as North Korea overcoming a final obstacle to becoming a fully nuclear-armed state.

One of the scientists said, “It became clear to me very quickly that these weren’t just heavy ice conditions, these were unprecedented ice conditions. We were finding thick multi-year sea ice floes which on level ice were five metres thick… it was much, much thicker and much, much heavier than anything you would expect at that latitude and at that time of year.”

"Ex-HSBC currency trader Mark Johnson, who was unwittingly captured on an audio recording saying“I think we got away with it,”has just been convicted by a jury in New York of fraud for front-running a $3.5 billion transaction that netted his firm some $8 million in illicit profits. PerBloomberg:
Former HSBC Holdings Plc currency traderMark Johnson was found guilty of fraud for front-running a $3.5 billion client order, a victory for U. S. prosecutors as they seek to root out misconduct in global financial markets.
He was convicted on Monday after a month-long trial in Brooklyn, New York.
Johnson was the first person to be tried since the global currency-rigging scandal that resulted in global banks paying more the $10 billion in penalties. The charges stemmed from HSBC’s execution of a trading order fromCairn Energy Plcin 2011 to convert the proceeds of a unit sale from dollars into pounds.
“This sends a signal to traders and banks that this type of behavior is absolutely inappropriate and will be pursued by the government,”Michael Weinstein, aformer Justice Department trial attorney, said.“That’s a big hammer over the banks — it may force them to monitor and self-regulate their people.”
For those who haven’t followed this particular story, Mark Johnson was arrested at New York’s Kennedy Airport in 2016 before he could return to the U. K. following a nearly 3-year investigation into efforts on the part of several large investment banks to rig FX markets but Stuart Scott has remained free at his home in the London suburbs pending the outcome of the extradition proceedings. PerBloomberg:
Mark Johnson, HSBC’s global head of foreign exchange cash trading in London, was taken into custody at John F. Kennedy International Airport Tuesday and is scheduled to appear before a judge in federal court in Brooklyn Wednesday morning,said the people, who asked not to be named because the case hasn’t been made public. He’s charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, the people said.
According to Bloomberg, Johnson’s arrest comes more than a year after five global banks pleaded guilty to charges related to the rigging of currency benchmarks. HSBC, which wasn’t part of those criminal cases, in November 2014 agreed to pay $618 million in penalties to U. S. and British regulators to resolve currency manipulation allegations. HSBC, which still faces investigations by the Justice Department and other authorities for the conduct, has set aside $1.3 billion for possible settlements, according to an August filing.
Rob Sherman, an HSBC spokesman, and Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment.
According to the originalDOJ complaint, HSBC was selected by Cairn Energy Plc to execute a foreign exchange transaction – which was going to require converting approximately $3.5 billion in sales proceeds into British Pound Sterling – in October 2011. But, before executing that trade, he tipped off a bunch of HSBC traders who loaded up their proprietary accounts with Pounds just before the massive trade sent the currency higher.
“As alleged, the defendants placed personal and company profits ahead of their duties of trust and confidentiality owed to their client, and in doing so, defrauded their client of millions of dollars,”stated United States Attorney Capers. “When questioned by their client about the higher price paid for their significant transaction, the defendants wove a web of lies designed to conceal the truth and divert attention away from their fraudulent trades. The charges and arrest announced today reflect our steadfast commitment to hold accountable corporate executives and licensed professionals who use their positions to fraudulently enrich themselves.”
“The defendants allegedly betrayed their client’s confidence, and corruptly manipulated the foreign exchange market to benefit themselves and their bank,” said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. “This case demonstrates the Criminal Division’s commitment to hold corporate executives, including at the world’s largest and most sophisticated institutions, responsible for their crimes.”
As we’ve noted over the past couple of weeks, tidbits of the prosecution’s case has made it’s way into the media recently, including reports last week that Johnson used the code phrase “my watch is off” to trigger trading by HSBC traders all around the globe. Meanwhile, asLaw360recently pointed out, jurors also had the opportunity to hear some rather damning recordings of Johnson’s phone conversations with traders, including the one below in which he says“I think we got away with it.”
Prosecutors played a recording of a call between Johnson and Stuart after the 3 p.m. fix as they debrief, with Johnson telling Stuart,“I think we got away with it,”but Stuart replies that HSBC executive Dipak Khot — who acted as the go between with Cairn and HSBC — thinks otherwise and suspects that Cairn will protest.
Johnson in turn argued that Cairn is still in a better position than it would have been if it had taken any other offers to execute the deal in alternate methods as opposed to the fix.“They don’t really have a lot of room to complain,”he said on the call.
But as Cahill was trading ahead of the 3 p.m. fix on the day of the transaction, Johnson sounded more concerned about “ramping it up” too much. Jurors heard another recording of a call between Johnson and Scott, with Scott talking to Cahill in the background as he trades, in which Johnson cautions against spiking the price of sterling too high out of concern that Cairn will “squeal.”
“Frank, Frank if it rates above 30 at the fix, I think they’ll start to ah … if you need to buy them, obviously, but ideally don’t ramp it above 30,”Scott tells Cahill. “Do what you need to do, but … sorry I know I’m probably not helping much…I’ll leave you alone.”
“He can’t, fucking moaning bastard,” Johnson said. “I do all the work and he gets all the glory.”
Jurors heard that days later in a call with HSBC forex trader Ed Carmichael in Hong Kong, Johnson told him that HSBC’s London forex trading desk, “just had a bonanza” on the Cairn deal, and described his response when Cairn sought an explanation on the less than stellar result for the oil and gas developer.
Of course, when HSBC’s client complained about their less than stellar execution price, Johnson admits that he blamed all the usual suspects: “Russians, other central banks, all that sort of stuff.”
“And they said, well you know it jumped up a bit, who else was buying? And we said the usual Russian names, other central banks, all that sort of stuff,”Johnson said on the call.
As we noted last week, nearly a dozen HSBC traders around the globe netted over $8 million in profits by allegedly front-running their own client.
Of course, while the DOJ will undoubtedly celebrate their conviction in the media, there is little doubt that Mark Johnson’s “pre-hedging” scandal is hardly unique for an industry that has been built on front-running clients.

"The National Football League is starting to learn what happens when you let your paid employees disrespect The United States of American and all she stands for.
Our boycott is working folks. The NFL’s TV ratings were once again down again in week two. A Jefferies analyst has projected that its TV partners could lose out on $200 million or more, in earnings, if its rating troubles persist in a double-digit way. During week two the NFL saw a 4% drop from 2016’s week two in live and same-day average viewers of Sunday games and a 14% drop in viewers for Monday Night Football.
I am sure NFL spokesmen will deflect the blame by saying there are too many penalties or that the games are too long. But patriotic Americans know very well what’s going on, and it’s not the games. It’s the players disrespecting our nation, her flag and all of us, by refusing to stand for the national anthem.
The National Football League is in the midst of turbulent times as ratings for the second week of the football season received less than promising returns.
After a 12 percent dip during the kickoff weekend from 2016, week 2 saw a 15 percent slump from the previous year. The NFL on CBS singleheader on Sunday afternoon brought in an 8.4 rating and 14.5 million viewers, which is down 24 percent from last year’s broadcast on FOX that brought in an 11.0 rating and 19.2 million viewers. CBS’ 8.4 rating is the lowest its had since 1998. CBS’ 8.4 rating is the lowest its had since 1998, and has seen double-digit drops for two straight weekends this year.
Some are arguing that the situation between Colin Kaepernick and the NFL is a reason why viewership is dropping. Progressives with big followings like social justice writer Shaun King have called for a complete boycott of the NFL for its “anti-blackness.” Meanwhile, conservatives like actor James Woods is boycotting the NFL, too, for allowing Kaepernick’s protest of the flag to happen in the first place.
The four networks who broadcast NFL games, CBS, ESPN, Fox, and NBC will generate a total of around $2.5 billion in NFL ad revenue this year alone. This would mean that a 10% drop in ratings over the course of the season could cost those networks a total of $200 million cut in earnings.
Every NFL Player Who Has Protested During the National Anthem this Season
If you were under the impression that Colin Kaepernick’s continued unemployment would cause NFL players to think twice before protesting during the national anthem, think again.
Last year, Kaepernick sat (and later kneeled) during the anthem to protest police brutality and racial inequality. Several other players joined him throughout the season. Yet despite the blowback Kaepernick received in some quarters, NFL players appear even more eager to protest than last season. Perhaps the biggest story of the 2017 preseason has been the willingness of players to demonstrate during the pregame rendition of the anthem.
After the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., earlier this month, momentum only seems to be growing. What started with Marshawn Lynch and Michael Bennett this preseason has grown to a wide range of players, mostly black but also white. During one preseason game, the Browns staged the largest group protest to date, with at least 10 players demonstrating.
Here’s a look at the players who have knelt, sat or demonstrated in some way during the national anthem so far this season.

 Other Browns players, such as Jason McCourty and Shon Coleman, stood near the group of kneeling players on Monday night in an apparent show of support.
 About 30 Browns players stood with their arms linked together before their game against the Buccaneers
It was only a matter of time until the American people got smart and started to see these rich elite spoiled brat players for what they really are. They make more money in one year than most of us will see in an entire lifetime. But instead of rising with beaming pride for the flag that stands for the nation that provides their unmatched wealth just for tossing a ball around, they decide to bow in disrespect because they want to protest a police officer having to kill a drug dealing gang banger who pulled a gun on them.
Please share if you are boycotting the NFL until the disrespect stops….",1

"Shares of Equifax shed more than 13% of their value in Friday trading, one day after the credit reporting companyrevealed that personal data on nearly half of all U. S. consumers potentially had been compromised.
The Atlanta-based company said Thursday that about 143 million U. S. consumers could be affected by a cybersecurity attack carried out by suspected criminal hackers. That's about 44% of the U.S population.
Equifax shares closed down $19.49 or nearly 13.7% at $123.23.
Raj Joshi, a Moody's vice president and senior analyst, in a Friday note termed thecyberattacka negative credit factorfor Equifax ""because it will impede the company's solid earnings growth over the next three to four quarters and hurt its reputation as a custodian of consumer data for over 200 million consumers.""
However, Moody's maintained Equifax's Baa1 senior unsecured rating and stable outlook ""because we expect the impact of the security breach will only modestly erode"" the company's ""solid credit metrics and liquidity,"" wrote Joshi.
The hacking attacks occurred from mid-May through July 2017 and primarily involved names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some cases, driver's license numbers. Equifax said it first detected the cyberbreach on July 29.
The hackers gained access to credit card numbers for roughly 209,000 consumers, plus certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 consumers.
While it took Equifax more than a month to reveal the attack, three of its top executives, including the chief financial officer, sold shares after the companyfirst learned of the breach, its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.
Two days after Equifax learned of the attack, CFO John Gamble sold shares with a market value of nearly $946,400, while Joseph Loughran, president of Equifax's U. S. Information Solutions, exercised options to sell nearly $584,100.
Rodolfo Ploder, president of business unit Workforce Solutions, sold shares valued at nearly $250,500 on Aug. 2, the filings show. The three executives continued to hold tens of thousands of Equifax shares after the transactions.
Equifax said the officials ""had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred"" at the time they sold their shares.
Atlanta-based Equifax is one of the nation's largest credit-reporting companies, along with Experian and TransUnion. Equifax says it analyzes data on more than 820 million consumers and more than 91 million businesses worldwide.
The company established a dedicated website,www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, to help consumers determine whether their personal information may have been accessed and sign up for credit file monitoring and identity theft protection.
""Given the important role credit scores play in the lives and financial futures of hardworking Americans, Congress must diligently examine the way our credit reporting agencies are operating and impose additional statutory and regulatory reforms to protect the integrity of the country’s credit reporting system,"" Rep.

"Do you recall that a hospital actually paid hackers $17,000 ransom for the release of the hospital’s data? That was the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, which paid using Bitcoin in February 2016. Another hacked company didn’t get off so cheaply! The South Korean web hosting company Nayana paid 397.6 Bitcoin, which was equivalent to almost a million dollars! That’s not all.

So what does the above have to do with AMI Smart Meters?
A smart meter hack is the unauthorized access of a smart meter or its data transmissions for the purpose of obtaining user information or altering communications between the device and the responsible utility. [….] An external party, on the other hand, might hack the device’s data transmissions to obtain information about activities within the premises. [….] There are a number of ways to interfere with smart meters. [….] If data transmissions aren’t sufficiently protected, external hackers can interrupt communications between a smart meter and the utility to access useful information. [….]
The potential also exists for a malware attack that would disrupt the energy grid. According to Raj Samani of the Cloud Security Alliance, smart meter security breaches to date include “insecure meters, hacking of customer details, denial of service attacks and suspected infiltration by foreign intelligence services. IoT Agenda [10]
AMI Smart Meters are nothing short of computers, which will have to be replaced for updated models every 5 to 6 years with utility customers paying for each and every replacement over the years, versus the safe, dependable and unhackable, analog meters that lasted for decades without update-replacements needed!
The operating system for AMI Smart Meters is microwave technology—think cell phones—and those systems and grids are porous, very porous. Any computer-savvy kid or dyed-in-the-wool hacker will be able not only to hack into the electrical network via smart meters, they will be able to ‘cyber stalk’ individuals for nefarious reasons. It’s only a matter of time, since the utility companies do not have safety measures preventing hacking built into their systems run by microwaves. That’s either cost prohibitive or they don’t have the technology available to make them hack-proof, as I understand.
However, what happens when hackers start a concerted effort to take down a utility or a town or a government using the porous AMI Smart Meters as their portal into the nation-wide electrical system? Will ransoms be demanded, and who will pay? Sound familiar? Remember, the USA takes the position it will not pay for the release of hostages.
You may think all the above to be outlandish gibberish, but gung-ho tech enthusiasts don’t bother with designing anti-hacking systems with the next high tech upgrade they think up and implement. Otherwise, AMI Smart Meters would never have been invented since they leave a lot to be desired in many areas.
Safety issues of all sorts, especially those regarding human health affected by non-thermal radiation waves spewed out thousands of times a day by AMI Smart Meters have not been addressed and probably will not be until some drastic event or problems occur for utility companies and the public utility commissions that approved them.
Early in January 2017, security researcher Netanel Rubin stated smart meters are “dangerously insecure” because the gear uses weak encryption, relies on easily pwned [sic / owned] protocols, and can be programmed to explode. [7]
If an attacker could hack your meter, he could have access to all the devices connected to the meter. The smart meter network in its current state is completely exposed to attackers. [7]
The entirety of the electricity grid, your home, your city, and everything in between will be in control of your energy utility, and that’s a bit scary. [7]
Does all this sound “too out of touch with reality”? Well, here’s the real clincher: A smart meter hacking tool has been built and released! It’s called the “Termineter,” an open-access tool to assess the security of smart meters! [8]
Then there’s this hi-tech hacking device: the Power Pwn, “a DARPA-funded power strip that will hack your network for launching remotely-activated Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Ethernet attacks.” [9]
Now, what do you think about that AMI Smart Meter forced on to your utility service?

"Over a million truck drivers could soon be out of work as self driving vehicles start taking over the roads
The rise of automation and the impact AI software and robots will have on the global workforce is increasingly on the minds of both economic analysts and everyday citizens.
Automation stands to fleece 80 million American jobs in the next 10 to 20 years. One of the staples of the American workforce, the trucking industry, could be the next to see the impact of this new economic game changer. New forecasts indicate that over the next ten years, 1.7 million trucker drivers could lose their jobs to robots.
Analysts say that within the next decade, giant automakers and ridesharing companies will easily be able to replace their human employees with driverless trucks. If this happens, it will eliminate one of the only remainingmiddle-class jobsthat does not require a college degree.
The likelihood of this happening is greater than one might think. Earlier this month, Uber announced it would be testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh. The ride-sharing company said its beta rollout would include humans behind the wheel in a supervising capacity. Many took this news as an anomaly, assuming the technology is still far from being utilized. The reality is,autonomous cars are actually closer than you may think from hitting the roadways. It seems integration and monetization are the major unknown factors that remain.
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick believes driverless cars won’t destroy jobs so much as replace them with new jobs. The only examples he gives to support this claim are that peoplewillbe necessary for “maintaining the fleet” and assisting with dangerous road conditions. However, in the same statement, he projected some bleak numbers:
This would suggest one human driver for every 10 vehicles in a fleet. This means major job losses, and it would seem the trucking industry is going to be the first to sustain these losses. Stanford analyst and lecturer, Jerry Kaplan, explains why.
“We are going to see a wave and an acceleration in automation, and it will affect job markets,” says Kaplan. “Long-haul truck driving is a great example, where there isn’t much judgment involved and it’s a fairly controlled environment.”
Taxis, buses, and delivery vehicles — which account for another 1.7 million jobs — will likely be in next in line, along with ride-sharing drivers.
Such prognostications are spurring some to question whether America will have to implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI) in order to protect people who lose their jobs to robots.",1

A few weeks ago the Board of Trustees of Social Security sent a formal letter to the United States Senate and House of Representatives to issue a dire warning: Social Security is running out of money.
Given that tens of millions of American depend on this public pension program as their sole source of retirement income, you’d think this would have been front page news…
… and that every newspaper in the country would have reprinted this ominous projection out of a basic journalistic duty to keep the public informed about an issue that will affect nearly everyone.
The story was hardly picked up.
It’s astonishing how little attention this issue receives considering it will end up being one of the biggest financial crises in US history.
That’s not hyperbole either– the numbers are very clear.
The US government itself calculates that the long-term Social Security shortfall exceeds $46 TRILLION.
In other words, in order to be able to pay the benefits they’ve promised, Social Security needs a $46 trillion bailout.
That amount is over TWICE the national debt, and nearly THREE times the size of the entire US economy.
Moreover, it’s nearly SIXTY times the size of the bailout that the banking system received back in 2008.
So this is a pretty big deal.
More importantly, even though the Social Security Trustees acknowledge that the fund is running out of money, their projections are still wildly optimistic.
In order to build their long-term financial models, Social Security’s administrators have to make certain assumptions about the future.
What will interest rates be in the future?
What will the population growth rate be?
How high (or low) will inflation be?
These variables can dramatically impact the outcome for Social Security.
For example, Social Security assumes that productivity growth in the US economy will average between 1.7% and 2% per year.
This is an important assumption: the higher US productivity growth, the faster the economy will grow. And this ultimately means more tax revenue (and more income) for the program.
But -actual- US productivity growth is WAY below their assumption.
Over the past ten years productivity growth has been about 25% below their expectations.
And in 2016 US productivity growth was actually NEGATIVE.
Here’s another one: Social Security is hoping for a fertility rate in the US of 2.2 children per woman.
This is important, because a higher population growth means more people entering the work force and paying in to the Social Security system.
But the actual fertility rate is nearly 20% lower than what they project.
And if course, the most important assumption for Social Security is interest rates.
100% of Social Security’s investment income is from their ownership of US government bonds.
So if interest rates are high, the program makes more money. If interest rates are low, the program doesn’t make money.
Where are interest rates now? Very low.
In fact, interest rates are still near the lowest levels they’ve been in US history.
Social Security hopes that ‘real’ interest rates, i.e. inflation-adjusted interest rates, will be at least 3.2%.
This means that they need interest rates to be 3.2% ABOVE the rate of inflation.
This is where their projections are WAY OFF… because real interest rates in the US are actually negative.
The 12-month US government bond currently yields 1.2%. Yet the official inflation rate in the Land of the Free is 1.7%.
In other words, the interest rate is LOWER than inflation, i.e. the ‘real’ interest rate is MINUS 0.5%.
So their assumptions are totally wrong.
And it’s not just Social Security either.
According to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston Collage, US public pension funds at the state and local level are also underfunded by an average of 67.9%.
Additionally, most pension funds target an investment return of between 7.5% to 8% in order to stay solvent.
Yet in 2015 the average pension fund’s investment return was just 3.2%. And last year a pitiful 0.6%.
This is a nationwide problem. Social Security is running out of money. State and local pension funds are running out of money.
And even still their assumptions are wildly optimistic. So the problem is much worse than their already dismal forecasts.
Understandably everyone is preoccupied right now with whether or not World War III breaks out in Guam.
But long-term, these pension shortfalls are truly going to create an epic financial and social crisis.
It’s a ticking time bomb, and one with so much certainty that we can practically circle a date on a calendar for when it will hit.
Waiting on politicians to fix the problem is not one of them.
The government does not have a spare $45 trillion lying around to re-fund Social Security.
So anyone who expects to retire with comfort and dignity is going to have to take matters into their own hands and start saving now.
Consider options like SEP IRAs and 401(k) plans that have MUCH higher contribution limits, as well as self-directed structures which give you greater influence over how your retirement savings are invested.
These flexible structures also allow investments in alternative asset classes like private equity, cashflowing royalties, secured lending, cryptocurrency, etc.
Learning how to be a better investor can increase your investment returns and (most importantly) reduce losses.
And increasing the long-term average investment return of your IRA or 401(k) by just 1% per year can have a PROFOUND (six figure) impact on your retirement.
These solutions make sense: there is ZERO downside in saving more money for retirement.
But it’s critical to start now. A little bit of effort and planning right now will pay enormous dividends in the future.

Russian Warning Issued Over Controlled Comet Headed Towards Earth
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
A chilling report prepared for President Medvedev by Minister Serdyukov of the Russian Defense Ministry on the building of an additional 5,000 underground bomb shelters in Moscow warns that even though progress is being made, the appearance of the new Comet Elenin [photo top left] in our Solar System means additional resources will have to be added immediately as the 2012 timeline for completion may not be soon enough.
Sparking the fears of Minister Serdyukov, he says in this report, is that based upon the new orbit calculations for Comet Elenin, it appears in all likelihood that this celestial object is under some type of intelligent control and will approach our Earth much closer than originally thought this coming fall season.
Comet Elenin was discovered by Doctor-Scientist Leonid Elenin [photo 3rd left] on 10 December 2010 from his research facility in Lyubertsy utilizing images acquired from the 18-inch (45-cm) telescope at the ISON-NM Observatory near Mayhill, New Mexico and confirmed by Doctor-Scientists Aleksei Sergeyev and Artem Novichenko from the Maidanak Observatory in Uzbekistan.
Upon its discovery Comet Elenin was traveling very near the ecliptic plane at more than 4 Astronomical Units (375 million miles) from the Sun and headed inbound towards it.  Its original perihelion [point in the orbit of a planet, asteroid or comet where it is nearest to the Sun] was calculated to occur well inside Earth's orbit at about 0.45 Astronomical Units (42 million miles) from the Sun to occur on or about 5 September 2011 making it visible to the naked eye in the pre-dawn skies in the Constellation of Leo.
Most ominous in Minister Serdyukovs report is his assertion that Comet Elenin appears to be in direct contact with the mysterious Jupiter-sized planet discovered beyond the orbit of Pluto that is, also, headed inbound towards our Sun.
American scientists Daniel Whitmire and John Matese from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette have named this mysterious planet Tyche, but as we had previously stated in our 18 February report, Russian Leader Confirms To Pope New Planet Arrival In 2012, the ancient peoples of our Earth new it by other names as well.
Interesting to note about Comet Elenin is that even though the American space agency NASA has said Because of the possibility that the comet's orbit slightly deviate from, there is no guarantee that Earth will be missed, they have, also, in contradiction, stated that Comet Elenin will come nowhere near the Earth. At its closest (on 10 September 2011) it will be more than 25 million km from our planet.
To the identity of those extraterrestrial forces controlling Comet Elenin our world had been forewarned about by the former Canadian Defense Minister, Paul Hellyer, who stated about them: Decades ago, visitors from other planets warned us about where we were headed and offered to help. But instead we, or at least some of us, interpreted their visits as a threat, and decided to shoot first and ask questions after.
As to those visitors from other planets referred to by Minister Hellyer we can further glean from the memo sent to President Franklin Roosevelt (1882-1945) by his Army Chief of Staff George Marshall (1880-1959) [reprinted below in its entirety] about what is now referred to as The Battle of Los Angeles where American Forces fired upon a UFO fleet shortly after their countries entrance into World War II.
From the United States initial firing upon these UFOs in The Battle of Los Angeles they continued to appear over both the European and Pacific Theaters of Operation during World War II and were dubbed as Foo Fighters by the US Army Air Forces 415th Night Fighter Squadron.
The most famous modern historical account of these UFO/Foo Fighters occurred in the summer of 1947 when at least one of them was shot down, or crashed near the Roswell Army Air Field in New Mexico which was home to the US Army Air Forces 509th Bomb Group that dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, and is known today as the Roswell Incident.
Though initially reported to the American public by their government that a flying saucer had, indeed, been captured, the US Military almost immediately contradicted themselves by denying what just 24-yours earlier they had admitted.
Most important to note about the Roswell Incident, however, was that its investigation was headed by the first US Air Force Secretary, and close personal friend of then President Harry Truman (1884-1072), Stuart Symington (1901-1988) who reported his findings to the first US Defense Secretary James Forrestal (1892-1949).
Throughout 1948, and into 1949, Secretarys Forrestal and Symington repeated clashed leading President Truman to replace Forrestal on 28 March 1949. Within two months (22 May 1949) Forrestal was reported dead by suicide after having jumped out the window of Bethesda Naval Hospital where he had been forcibly detained.
More interesting, however, is the report of the last meeting between Forrestal and Symington on the Roswell Incident, and as, in part, we can read:
Forrestal accused Clark of having the FBI shadow him, which Clark denied, but which according to all of Forrestals biographers could well have been true. Forrestal finally left office in a formal ceremony on March 28th, his last public appearance.
What followed after the ceremony remains mysterious. ""There is something I would like to talk to you about,"" Symington told Forrestal, and accompanied him privately during the ride back to the Pentagon. What Symington said is not known, but Forrestal emerged from the ride deeply upset, even traumatized, upon arrival at his office. Friends of Forrestal implied that Symington said something that ""shattered Forrestals last remaining defenses."" When someone entered Forrestals office several hours later, the former Secretary of Defense did not notice. Instead, he sat rigidly at his desk, staring at the bare wall, incoherent, repeating the sentence, ""you are a loyal fellow,"" for several hours.
As we have attempted to detail in many recent reports, including Greenland Sunrise Shocks World As Superstorms Pound Planet, Poisonous Space Clouds Slamming Into Earth Cause Mass Bird And Fish Deaths, New Superstorms Warned Have Doomed World Food Production and Pole Shift Blamed For Russian Air Disaster, Closure Of US Airport, the greatest fears Forrestal had after Symingtons final Roswell report was given to him are, indeed coming true in our times today.
Though the masses of the American people are still not being told the truth about the dire state of our world, the same cannot be said about their elite masters, who according to new evidence gathered by independent researchers are building for themselves vast underground bunkers to protect themselves when the times of trouble come.
One such company building these underground survival bunkers for the US elite is the American Reassurance Communities (ARC), and who describe their efforts as follows:
Each ARC Bunker Complex consists of a 300,000 sq ft subterranean self-contained community survival shelter complex designed to accommodate 2500 people for up to 60 months in military grade bunkers complete with schools, medical/dental, greenhouses, theater, recreation, everything needed for a large group of people to live in a safe, comfortable environment and survive almost any disaster.
ARC Bunkers are manufactured to withstand a direct nuclear hit, EMP (electro-magnetic pulse) attacks, biological attacks, hurricanes, tornados, volcanos, earthquakes, floods, solar flares, meteorites, and ground assaults.
For anyone thinking they can order such protection for themselves (even allowing that they have the hundreds of thousands of dollars it would cost) an ARC spokesman said in a recently released conversation (listen to audio here) that it would take over a year for them to be able to build anything because of the tremendous backorders they are now filling due to what he says is because everyone is freaked out about something.  And this is aside from the US governments recent purchase of over $1 Billion in survival food to protect Americas leaders.
To what those in the knowing are so freaked about it is in our knowing too, but is, also, so complex and shrouded in shadows as to make it nearly indecipherable to all but the most informed, and which, most assuredly, the masses of people today arent even close to.
The complete story, and the knowledge you have a right to know, is only going to be gained by yourself as those who rule over you will tell you nothing, even to the point of disparaging those, like us, who believe not only in your right to know the truth, but how simple it can really be to protect yourself and your families from the many horrors yet to come.
This report, therefore, like all the others before it, is but another puzzle piece to be put into place so that when added to the many others to come will show you the shattering truth being kept from you.
Our efforts to keep you informed, also, come at great cost, but which you are able to help out with by going to this Link.
The great German romantic writer Jean Paul Richter (1763-1825) once said, A timid person is frightened before a danger, a coward during the time, and a courageous person afterward.  And these are, indeed, the times one has to choose which they are, we hope you are courageous, they will be the only ones to survive.

The old traitors and Nazis just don’t get it, do they?The traitorous Nazi stooges in Japan have been trying everything in their power to steal money from the Japanese people in order to hand it to the Federal Reserve Board crime syndicate. According to Black Dragon Society members the traitors trying this are: former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and his son, former Prime Minister Koizumi, former BOJ vice president Toshiro Muto, former BOJ governor Fukui, former Finance Minister Heizo Takenaka, and Yoshifumi Nishikawa, ex-president of the Sumitomo-Mitsui Banking group. They are trying to cash Kennedy silver and gold-backed bonds. The Japanese police and yakuza have been informed and we strongly recommend to these traitors that they resume their lives of retired gentlemen of leisure instead of going to jail.
On a different front, although it is still not fully confirmed, we have reason to believe George Bush Senior and his wife Barbara have been killed. That means the new Nazi leadership consists of Henry (Heinz) Kissinger, Paul Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney, Ben (deputy Fuhrer) Bernanke and that whole crowd of neo-con neo-Nazis. If I were them, I would be very scared right now.
When Paul Wolfowitz came to the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, I asked him the following question: “In the Plan for a New American Century you called for a huge military build-up despite the end of the cold war. Shouldn’t that money have been better spent say, ending poverty and stopping environmental destruction?”
The entire assembled press and diplomatic corps issued a loud nervous giggle on hearing this question while Wolfowitz for a second displayed an expression of sheer terror. Wolfowitz later used 911 and the “war on terror,” as his excuse but that look on his face told me what I need to know. He knows he is being a very bad boy. I would like to tell you Wolfowitz that you had better surrender before it is too late. You can surrender now and appear before a truth committee in exchange for amnesty or you can wait until the wheels of justice slowly but inevitably grind their way towards you and you get the death penalty. The same goes for all of you Nazis. Surrender now with dignity or end up like Mussolini or worse.
Obama’s rule will end in January or February as part of desperate Fed gambitThe Nazi’s and Zionazis who have taken over the US government are planning to take down President Obama in either January or February according to both CIA and MI6 sources. The take-down will either be through a trial about his citizenship due on January 26th (MI6) or else through “acute terminal cancer(CIA).” Vice President Biden may also suffer from a heart attack at around the same time, opening the way for Mossad agent Nancy Pelosi to be President and Mossad agent Rahm Emmanuel to be vice President, the two sources concur.
In the meantime the Federal Reserve crime syndicate and the Bank of England are trying to prolong their lives by lying once again about the gold coated tungsten bars shipped to the Chinese (we have now been able to confirm with high level Chinese sources the tungsten was sent to China) and elsewhere. The story is now “those tungsten bars were just for security and the real gold is located somewhere else; don’t worry, we will get it for you soon.” Now the Feds are scouring the earth trying to locate people who are dumb enough to trade gold for their toxic financial waste. The owner’s of the world’s gold are determined not to give them even an ounce. They have been receiving desperate calls from the World Bank, the IMF and many central banks but none of them will get gold, the gold owners say. So, meetings due on January 6th and January 29th about settling gold futures contracts may well trigger the bankruptcy of the Federal Reserve Board and the Bank of England.
There are three major factions ready to replace the Fed, the owners of the world’s gold who want a gold backed financial system, the Chinese and their allies who want a convertible renminbi backed by a basket of commodities and the Feds who just want to reboot the Fed minus the garbage. Ultimately the Chinese and the gold owners are likely to cut some sort of compromise deal, most likely centered on the Hong Kong dollar.
Meanwhile, the Pentagon rank and file is close to open rebellion, according to the CIA source. “It will be up to the Colonels and the majors because all the decent people are usually purged from the ranks at the level of generals,” the source says. We are also now hearing that many of the US underground bases are no longer under Nazi control.
As things come to a head, the desperate, satanic Nazis will no doubt try to pull off some murderous stunt to prevent their inevitable collapse. We must remain extremely alert and ready for any crazy surprise they try to pull off.
The Feds may be planning to dump all the toxic garbage on Bank of AmericaThe desperate, cornered criminal rats who own the Federal Reserve Board are now planning to take all their toxic financial waste and dump it on Bank of America and make it the fall guy, according to a CIA source. That is why they have been unable to find a new CEO. However, that is not going to be enough to save the criminals.
Multiple, reliable sources including MI6 and the Chinese government now confirm that the Federal Reserve Board and the Bank of England were using gold-plated tungsten to “back up” their massive selling of gold futures. As the contracts came due for the delivery, the scam was unveiled.
This means that as long as the US remains under the control of fascist gangsters, it will be treated as a pariah state. Unless the Federal Reserve Board control of the United States ends, the United States is expected to be cut off from the international trading system in January. Sources both within the N. W.O. and MI6 and in China say the dollar will fall to under 6 cents by that time. In such an event, the Feds will try to implement martial law and detain millions of US citizens in concentration camps, according to CIA and other sources.
However, if the US returns to a constitutional democratic form of government, their debts will be paid off in gold and huge amounts of money will be invested in rebuilding the US economy. In that event, the US dollar should rise in value.
Meanwhile, the Feds have sent N.W.O. agent Dragi Emseriev (of Macedonian descent carrying a Swiss Passport) to Japan along with fellow with fellow Turkish and Bulgarian Turks and possibly 1 Turkish Intelligence Officer in an attempt to sabotage the Japanese economy. They are believed to be trying to cash the 134.5 Billion USD Kennedy bonds seized in Italy this summer. A Bulgarian Turk named Emroullah is possibly carrying the bonds. This group is notorious for running fraudulent Private program games in Switzerland and is now in Japan so we must stay alert. Some well known Japanese are also part of this but we will keep their names to ourselves for now.They know who they are and we know who they are so we suggest they surrender or face the consequences.
A Turkish man by the name of Dragi Emseriev is due to arrive in Japan soon to carry out economic sabotage with big denomination bonds. He must be detained at the border.
US military faction seeks to start new wars in order to solve financial crisisWith the bankruptcy of the Federal Reserve Board imminent, a powerful faction in the Pentagon and the CIA would like to start several wars in a desperate attempt to keep the United States of Amerika corporation going, a CIA source says. The problem with this plan, of course is that wars cost money and the US has no money to pay for them.
The Black Dragon Society is offering a much better alternative: $6 trillion to invest in developing the over 6,000 patents suppressed by the Washington D.C. satanic establishment. The fund would be available only after the criminal organization known as the Federal Reserve Board is dismantled.
The short-sighted criminally insane gangsters who infiltrated and took over the United States have held back human progress by at least 100 years. Once they are gone, the genie of new technology will be released from its bottle.
China has stealthily introduced a new financial system based on the renminbi which is well on its way to becoming fully convertible, according to a high-level Chinese source. In addition, China is purchasing 10,000 tons of gold to back up a new fund designed to develop and market heretofore forbidden and suppressed technologies. The fund will be based outside of China and will be controlled by prominent members of the Chinese overseas community. The gold purchase will take some time because of the logistics of transporting it and the Chinese wish to test it thoroughly. Both the Chinese government and MI6 now confirm reports that much of the gold sold by the Federal Reserve Board over the past decade is in fact gold plated tungsten.
For its part, the renminbi is now convertible with South American currencies, the rouble, Middle-Eastern currencies, the yen, South East Asian currencies and African currencies. “We will slowly introduce our new financial system in parallel with the old one and hope that people steadily migrate towards it,” the Chinese official says.
Meanwhile, the latest G20 meeting ended in acrimony and chaos. The leadership of the West is in total disarray and will remain so until the Federal Reserve Board’s bankruptcy becomes visible even to brainwashed section of the Western public. This is now expected by January or February. Both MI6 and a senior Chinese government source now predict the collapse of the Federal Reserve dollar by that time.
We are also hearing various reports that many Pentagon and other US alphabet suit agency figures with both US and Israeli citizenship have recently fled to Israel. Things are coming to a head.",1
"As the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is getting out of control, there are developing reports blaming the US for manufacturing Ebola and HIV viruses as part of its military’s bio-weapons projects using African people as guinea pigs.
Reports have pointed out that the US and a number of Western countries are using the Ebola outbreak to expand their military presence in mineral-rich Africa, challenge China’s growing engagement across the continent and offer their pharmaceutical companies the opportunity to gain financial benefits from development and sale of potential treatment drugs.
Leading the charge on the role of the US military in the development and spread of the Ebola virus in Africa is Liberian scientist, Dr. Cyril Broderick, who alleges that the US Department of Defense (DoD) is engaged in funding Ebola trials on humans that commenced only weeks before the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone and Guinea last January.
According to Broderick, a former professor of Plant Pathology at the University of Liberia who also taught for many years at the Agricultural College of the US-based University of Delaware, the Pentagon granted a USD 140 million contract to Canadian pharmaceutical company, Tekmira, to perform Ebola research, which involved “injecting and infusing healthy humans with the deadly Ebola virus.”
“Hence, the DoD is listed as a collaborator in a ‘first in human’ Ebola clinical trial, which started in January 2014 shortly before an Ebola epidemic was declared in West Africa in March,” Broderick wrote in a September 9 article in Liberia’s largest newspaper, Daily Observer.
“Disturbingly,” he added, “many reports also conclude that the US government has a viral fever bioterrorism research laboratory in Kenema, a town at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.”
This is while the US government has been experimenting with deadly diseases on human beings for a lengthy period of time.
One clear instance took place between 1946 and 1948 in the Central American nation of Guatemala, where the administration of then US president, Harry Truman, collaborated with the client state’s authorities to deliberately infect more than 1,500 soldiers, prostitutes, prisoners and even mental patients with syphilis and other sexually-transmitted diseases.
Insisting that the U S, Canada, France, and Britain are “all implicated” in the development of the Ebola epidemic, Broderick also blamed the World Health Organization (WHO) and Doctors Without Borders of bringing Ebola to Africa through vaccination programs.
Meanwhile, other press reports allege that the US views the Ebola outbreak as a “perfect opportunity” to achieve a long-held Western objective to expand a US military presence in Africa to challenge growing Chinese investment and influence across the continent.
This is while the Washington Post reported in August that China “has arguably become the most formidable of the foreign players in Africa” in recent years by surpassing the US as Africa’s largest trading partner in 2009.
Further pointing to the US military agenda in Africa, media reports have underlined statements made by US Vice Admiral Robert Moeller in a 2008 Africom conference held at Washington’s Fort McNair, saying that Africom’s mission also aimed at preserving “the free flow of natural resources from Africa to the global market.”
Moeller also wrote in a 2010 opinion piece in the Foreign Policy Journal, titled ‘The Truth about Africom’ that “Let there be no mistake. Africom’s job is to protect American lives and promote American interests.”",1
"Climate alarmists and mainstream media are trying to convince everyone that President Trump condemned the planet to ruin by refusing to sign the expensive and pointless Paris Climate Accord, butone very influential man — John Coleman, founder of the Weather Channel — has hit back at the phonies and called them out on their self-serving lies.
In a series of tweets and emails Coleman sent to Al Gore and various Democratic supporters and organizations, he called out climate alarmists with a barrage of facts based on actual science and not politically correct liberal groupthink.
As it turns out, if you chart global temperatures back into the ’70s, there is absolutelyno sign of global warming.
There’s been less than one degree temperature change since 1978 and no warming to speak of since 1998. So where was the Democratsand their propaganda mouthpieces in the mainstream media getting their information from?
Yovav Gad reports: It turns out that the government has been manipulating climate computer models. This means that the American taxpayers are being charged $4.7 billion a year in taxes that are being used to fund organizations that carry out meaningless studies based on bad science.
Basically, the American people are paying fake scientists to lie to them.
Spread this everywhere. Donald Trump deserves our support. He wants to help this nation. We can’t live in lies anymore. Trump’s move will save $100 billion and jobs! We can not afford luxuries now. Share this post if you support our President’s policy!
Gore said that on Sept. 21, 2007, “scientists reported with unprecedented alarm that the North Polar icecap is, in their words, ‘falling off a cliff.’ One study estimated that it could be completely gone during summer in less than 22 years. Another new study to be presented by U. S. Navy researchers later this week warns that it could happen in as little as seven years, seven years from now.”
Former Vice President Al Gore basically started the “Global Warming” movement after producing a documentary film in 2006 “An Inconvenient Truth”. According toMichael Bastasch atthe DailyCaller.com Al Gore may have some other hidden incentives pushing his aggressiveGlobal Warming agenda —Liberal billionaire George Soros gave former Vice President Al Gore’s environmentalgroup millions of dollars over three years to create a “political space for aggressive U. S. action” on global warming, according to leaked documents. A document published by DC Leaks shows Soros, a Hungarian-born liberal financier, wanted his nonprofit Open Society Institute (OSI) to do more to support global warming policies in the U.S. That included budgeting $10 million in annual support to Gore’s climategroup over three years.
“U. S. Programs Global Warming Grants U.S. Programs became engaged on the global warming issue about four years ago, at George Soros’s suggestion,” reads a leaked OSI memo.“There has been a budget of $11 million for global warming grants in the U.S. Programs budget for the last several years,” the memo reads. “This budget item captures George Soros’s commitment of $10 million per year for three years to Al Gore’s Alliance for Climate Protection, which conducts public education on the climate issue in pursuit of creating political space for aggressive U.S. action in line with what scientists say is necessary to put our nation on a path to reducing its outsize carbon dioxide emissions.”
It’s unclear what year the memo was sent, but the Gore co-founded Alliance for Climate Protection (ACP) was established in 2006 and lasted until it became The Climate Reality Project in July 2011. In 2008, the Alliance launched a $300 million campaign to encourage “Americans to push for aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,” The Washington Post reported.
ACP got $10 million from the Open Society Institute (OSI) in 2008, according to the nonprofit’s tax filings. OSI handed over another $5 million to ACP in 2009, according to tax filings. The investigative reporting group ProPublica keeps a database that has OSI tax returns from 2000 to 2013. The DCNF could not find other years where OSI gave money to ACP.
Other reasons for changes in temperatures could also be related to things such as the Sun Solar variationand Aerosols forcing—scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming express varied opinions concerning the cause of global warming. Some say only that it has not yet been ascertained whether humans are the primary cause of global warming; others attribute global warming to natural variation; ocean currents; increased solar activity or cosmic rays. The consensus position is that solar radiation may have increased by 0.12W/m2 since 1750, compared to 1.6 W/m2 for the net anthropogenic forcing.
“The combined change in radiative forcing of the two major natural factors (solar variation and volcanic aerosols) is estimated to be negative for the past two, and possibly the past four, decades.“
A few studies say that the present level of solar activity is historically high as determined by sunspot activity and other factors. Solar activity could affect climate either by variation in the Sun’s output or, more speculatively, by an indirect effect on the amount of cloud formation. Solanki and co-workers suggest that solar activity for the last 60 to 70 years may be at its highest level in 8,000 years.",1

"The number of Americans without health insurance shrunk by about 500,000 in the first three months of 2017 from the same period in 2016, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The CDC found 28.1 million people or 8.8 percent of the population was uninsured in the first quarter of 2017. The dip from 2016 isn't statistically significant, when 28.6 million people or 9 percent of the population was uninsured, the CDC noted.
The uninsured population has declined from 48.6 million people, or 16 percent of the population, before the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare passed in 2010. The coverage rate has stayed relatively stable in the last few years, according to CDC's data. The CDC based its estimates for the first quarter of 2017 from data for 19,846 people.
But coverage rates are much higher in states that chose to expand Medicaid. In the first few months of 2017, states that expanded Medicaid had an uninsured rate of 8.6 percent for adults. States that chose not to expand Medicaid had an uninsured rate of 18.4 percent, the CDC's data shows.
Since 2010, the CDC found the uninsured rate has dipped the most for poor adults and children. In 2010, more than 40 percent of people below the poverty line were uninsured. In the first few months of 2017, 23 percent of poor adults were uninsured.
The downward trend in the number of uninsured people has proven difficult for Republicans in Congress to find a way to continue. All of the Republican plans proposed so far have increased the number of uninsured Americans by at least 20 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Without the CBO's figures in their favor, Republicans have dismissed the scores as unreliable or misleading. in July, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said a CBO finding that one Senate GOP plan would lave 22 million more people uninsured, ""bogus,"" saying, ""it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan; it's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want.""
President Trump has blamed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, among other top Republicans, for the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare. But as Congress returns next month, facing a debt limit and decisions on funding for Hurricane Harvey damage in Texas, the chances of reviving the health care debate look slim.",0

In the 1920s, French art collector Pierre Vérité began building -- almost in secret -- one of the world's most impressive stashes of African and Oceanic masterpieces. And over the years he developed an equally impressive client list.
When Vérité opened an art gallery in the Montparnasse area of Paris with his wife Suzanne in 1934, he saw the likes of Matisse and Picasso walk through the door to buy his pieces.
""Never before has anything like this been offered at auction.""
Alain de Monbrison
But he kept the crème de la crème off the shelves, according to Alain de Monbrison, an expert of African and Oceanian art, and a personal friend of the Vérité family.
""He used to sell art to some very important collectors,"" Monbrison said over the phone. ""He would sell some good items, but never the best ones -- those he would hide away.""

'Extremely rare' pieces
Now, almost 200 of those masterpieces are up for auction at Christie's in Paris, with a combined estimate of approximately $8 million. This is the second time that pieces from the Vérité collection have been offered for sale, coming after a 2006 auction broke records by bringing in more than $50 million.
Monbrison, who curated that sale, is back for this one, too: ""We sold a very important part of the collection in 2006. This time we're selling the pieces that Claude, Pierre's son, had kept for himself,"" he said. The top lot, a Hawaiian figure from the late 18th century, is expected to fetch up to 3 million euros ($3.5 million).

The carving represents the Hawaiian god of war, Ku-ka'ili-moku (meaning ""land snatcher""), with whom the first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Kamehameha I, associated himself in his mission to unite the islands. It bears the hallmarks of the traditional ""Kona"" style, including a wrestler-like posture and a broad eight-shaped mouth as a display of aggressiveness.
The figurine closely resembles a piece from the British Museum's collection, acquired by the London Missionary Society in 1822. Likely to have been carved by the same hand, the sculptures are both made of metrosideros wood, which is mostly found in the Pacific region.
""This is an extremely rare piece,"" said Monbrison. ""Never before has anything like this been offered at auction. All the other ones of this kind are in museums or institutions.""
A pioneering collector
Most of the pieces for sale haven't seen the light of day for decades, due to a tradition of secrecy in the Vérité family. Even though the collection was largely complete by the end of the 1930s, it was only revealed to the public for the first time in 1950: ""Pierre had bought a house that belonged to the painter Eugène Delacroix, about 30 kilometers outside of Paris. Most of the masterpieces were kept there, where nobody could see them,"" said Monbrison.
One item at the upcoming auction has escaped the public eye for nearly a century. The Uli figure, which is a type of wooden statue carved only in the villages of New Ireland in Papua New Guinea, was last seen in public in 1930.
This Uli figure will shown at an upcoming Christie's auction in Paris. Credit: Christie's Images Ltd, 2017
While he continued to loan items and contribute to academic studies of African and Oceanic art, Vérité stopped linking his name to his pieces in 1954. Loans were labeled as anonymous henceforth, adding to their mystique.
Although most of Vérité's African art was sold in the 2006 auction, a few remarkable pieces remain available. Among them is a figure from the Democratic Republic of Congo which was part of a 1935 exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art before being bought by Vérité. It belongs to an artistic style called Hemba, of which so little known at the time that it was incorrectly identified in the exhibition catalog. Most of these statues only found their way into collectors' hands from the 1970s.
It is testament to Vérité's pioneering vision that he acquired these pieces nearly 100 years ago. The value of these artworks has been rising ever since, according to Monbrison.
""We have never seen tribal art falling in value -- it always grows,"" he said. ""That's because it's rare: There are more and more museums, but fewer and fewer pieces.
""I don't like to speak in terms of investment, but buying tribal art anytime in the last 40 years would have been a great idea.""",0
"From the Roman Breviary of 1529, the conclusion of the sermon for the feast of All Saints.
We believe that this day’s festivity is also made renowned by the priests, doctors, and confessors of Christ, who spiritually nourish the hearts of the faithful, like heavenly waters, so that they may be able to bring forth in abundance the incorruptible fruit of good works. They have taken care not only to give back the talents entrusted to them, but also to increase them with interest, … ; for the good which they learned and understood through the grace of the Holy Spirit, they strove to impart not only to themselves, but to the minds of those subject to them. … Celebrating the sacred and holy mysteries of the Body and Blood of Christ upon the altar, in the depths of their heart they cease not to offer a living sacrifice, and pleasing to God, that is, themselves, without blemish or admixture of any evil deed. And although they did not feel the sword of the persecutors, yet through the merit of their lives, they are worthy of God and not deprived of martyrdom. For martyrdom is accomplished not only by the shedding of blood, but also by abstaining from sins, and the practice of God’s commandments. … Very many have shone forth with signs and wonders, restoring sight to the blind, strengthening the steps of the lame, giving hearing to the deaf, conquering demons, and raising the dead.
All Saints in Glory, by Giovanni da San Giovanni, 1630, in the apse of the church of the Four Crowned Martyrs in Rome.
Therefore, dearest brethren, with the full intention of our minds let us ask for the protection of the mighty intercessors of whom we have spoken, so that through the temporal feast which we keep, by their merits interceding, we may be able to come to eternal joy. All things pass away that are celebrated in time. Take care, all that take part in these solemnities, lest you be cut off from the eternal solemnity. For what profiteth it to take part in the feasts of men, if it befall you to miss the feasts of the Angels? (The words from “All things pass away…” to the end are added from a homily of Saint Gregory of Great for the Octave Day of Easter.)
From the Breviary of St. Pius V, 1568, the end of the treatise on mortality by St. Cyprian of Carthage, bishop and martyr, read on the Octave Day of All Saints.
We must consider, most beloved brethren, and continually reflect upon the fact that we have renounced the world, and in the meanwhile live here as guests and pilgrims. Let us embrace the day which assigns each of us to his own home, which restores us to paradise and the heavenly kingdom, delivered hence and freed from the snares of the world. What man that has been placed in foreign lands would not hasten to return to his own country? What man that is hastening to sail back to his friends desireth not the more eagerly a prosperous wind, that he might the sooner be able to embrace those dear to him?
We regard paradise as our country, already we begin to deem the patriarchs as our parents: why do we not hasten and run, that we may see our country, that we may greet our parents? There a great number of our dear ones awaits us, and a dense crowd of parents, brothers, children, longs for us, already assured of their own immortality, and still solicitous for our salvation. To attain to their sight and their embrace, what gladness both for them and for us in common! What delight there is in the heavenly kingdom, without fear of death; and how lofty and perpetual the happiness with eternity of living!
There the glorious choir of the apostles, there the host of the prophets rejoicing, there the innumerable multitude of the martyrs, crowned for the victory of their struggle and passion; there the triumphant virgins, who subdued the desire of the flesh and of the body by the strength of their continency. There are the merciful rewarded, who by feeding and helping the poor have done the works of justice, they who, in keeping precepts of the Lord, have transformed their earthly patrimonies into the heavenly treasures. To these, beloved brethren, let us hasten with eager desire; let us long quickly to be with them, that quickly we may come to Christ.
November 8th is also the feast of the Four Crowned Martyrs, the titular Saints of a very ancient but much-rebuilt church on the Caelian Hill in Rome. Every year on the feast, the altar is covered with a very beautiful frontal, and silver reliquary busts of the martyrs are displayed in the sanctuary.
Among the many inscriptions preserved in the church, this one records that Pope Leo IV (847-55) placed under the church’s altar the relics of the Four Crowned Martyrs, and a great many others; in addition to those listed by name here, he placed “many other bodies of Saints whose names are known to God.”

"Recently, a man filed a $100-million lawsuit against Little Caesars Pizza for allegedly feeding him pork instead of halal pepperoni. However, it only took 4 words from the franchise manager to have him dropping the lawsuit as quickly as he could.
According to the left, Muslims simply want tolerance and acceptance of their religious beliefs. Of course, their pleas for coexistence quickly turn to demands for Sharia recognition, special privilege, and accommodation of their endless religious compulsions. When these demands go unfulfilled or simply fail to meet their standards, threats and legal action are sure to follow.
While the tiny Muslim minority in the U. S. is perfecting the manipulation of our laws against us, we are finding that many of their grievances are either frivolous or completely fabricated. Unfortunately for one Muslim man, he forgot to tie up the loose ends in one of the most corrupt lawsuits in recent history.
Earlier this year, Dearborn resident Mohamad Bazzi and his convert wife, Michelle Meade, acquired the legal services of attorney Majed Moughni, a fellow Muslim who gained notoriety for suing a local KFC for serving a Yemeni-American couple bacon on their chicken sandwiches.
Hoping for a massive payout and to serve as a warning to Americans not to violate Sharia law, Bazzi and Moughni demanded a whopping $100-million in compensation for ingesting the pork product. However, they won’t be seeing a penny after hearing the franchise manager’s simple response.
In an unexpected twist, Moughni and his Muslim client have dropped the $100-million lawsuit shortly after the Dearborn-based restaurant manager revealed to the media that Bazzi had “ordered a regular pepperoni” but wanted a halal sticker placed on the box to make it seem as if the restaurant had sabotaged his order, Fox News reports. Not only will Moughni and his clients receive nothing for their relentless efforts, but Little Caesars also recently filed a counter lawsuit against Bazzi for “frivolous actions.”
Of course, Moughni wasn’t about to admit his attempt to scam the chain out of millions, instead claiming that he chose to drop the case because he has received multiple death threats against him and his 11-year-old daughter, according to the Detroit Free Press.
Majed Moughni, who is Muslim and of Arab descent, said he decided to drop the two remaining lawsuits after receiving threats on social media from a man who sent him an instant message on Facebook on Oct. 26 that read: “You better stop your lawsuit against Little Caesars you” followed by an expletive and a racial slur used against Arabs and blacks.
In addition, the man then posted to his Twitter account a tweet with photos of Moughni and family members, including his daughter, that read: “Muslim lawyer who wants to sue #LittleCaesars for $100,000,000 and his wife’s Facebook, daughter goes to” followed by the name of a school she attends, according to screenshots taken by Moughni.
While most lawyers would summon their aptitude for the law by taking these threat-makers to court instead of kowtowing to their demands, Moughni suspiciously threw out his clients’ major lawsuit simply because of a few threatening messages sent via social media, which almost anyone who speaks ill of Islam receives on a daily basis.
Of course, Moughni knows that it’s Muslims who tend to make good on these types of threats. Still, he makes a teary-eyed attempt to gain sympathy and direct our attention toward “Islamophobia” and anti-Muslim hate crimes, most of which turn out to be purely fabricated or committed by fellow Muslims.
The man who made the threats openly describes himself as a “white nationalist,” “homophobe,” and Donald Trump supporter, which gives off the stench of a fake account created to make Moughni the victim. The terms used by the social media account echo the exact lingo that leftists and their Muslim allies specifically use toward conservatives but that conservatives do not use to describe themselves.
Much to Moughni’s dismay, the police informed him that they won’t be pursuing his case against the man because they didn’t believe the messages contained actual threats. Expectedly, Moughni resorted to the typical rhetoric utilized by Muslims, accusing the police of Islamophobia.
For them, “it’s not a crime to threaten a Muslim attorney and his family,” Moughni said.
This only provides further evidence that not only was Moughni likely spearheading a fraudulent suit but also that he’s not very good at his job. In fact, the Muslim attorney already had this lawsuit thrown out of court for failure to provide evidence of their claim.
“Little Caesars is extremely pleased with the court’s complete dismissal of this meritless claim,” the company said in the statement.
Moughni and his Muslim clients are demonstrating the ideal form of conquest in a powerful, progressive democracy. While Muslims have vanquished societies by the sword for over 1,400 years, they’ve discovered that using our laws, liberties, and political correctness against us is a more effective way to bring the West under Sharia rule.",1

"In an obvious attempt to commit collective suicide, the NBA or the National Basketball Association, for those of us who actually have a life outside of watching rich spoiled brats throw a ball for a living, is now asking their players to be more vocal when it comes to addressing social issues. From denouncing anti-transgender bills to promoting gender equality in hiring.
This malarkey was sent by NBA commissioner Adam Silver as a letter the same day that Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett claimed that a Las Vegas cop racially profiled and harassed him.
The letter Silver wrote read, “None of us operate in a vacuum. Critical issues that affect our society also impact you directly. You have real power to make a difference in the world.”
Do these people even realize they just simply toss a ball for a living?
Silver didn’t go into specifics such as citing Black Lives Matter or Antifa, which are both Anti-American groups, but he went on to state that he believes that his ball players have a platform that reaches far beyond their athletic talents.
Again, they toss a damn ball for a living and hardly know how to read and write.
His letter actually went on to say that the NBA is about much more than a game. He added that NBA players have to continue to use the NBA’s “incredible” platform to help and engage with people everywhere.
Ummm, when did you engage when so many of us lost our health insurance coverage thanks to your party Silver? Oh, Sorry, forgot, Former President Barack Huessin Obama was black, so he’s untouchable to you and your illiterate players.
The letter follows a similar one sent by the NBA before the start of last season, right around the time Colin Kaepernick’s national anthem protest began.
With 21.8 million NFL fans tuning in, the kickoff of the 2017 regular season was down 13% for the NFL and NBC from last year’s opener. Not only does that represent a very real smack down for the league and the net coming off a previous season that saw double-digit declines in its early months, but it is the worst an opening game has done since 2009.
In fact, with Hurricane Irma evacuations in Florida likely having an effect on viewership in the Sunshine State, this is the first time in five years that the total audience of the kickoff game has fallen below 25 million. And, while the most watched network show in three months, even with streaming and other NBC platforms bumping things up to 22.2 million, the game still fell short of the 25 million mark.
All of which means a lot more is now riding on Sunday Night Football’s NY Giants and Dallas Cowboys match-up on September 10. Because if those two mega-market teams can’t score ratings-wise, the NFL has a real re-think on its agenda.
PREVIOUSLY, 6:51 AM: The consensus was that last night’s NFL kickoff game would see the favored New England Patriots win at home – but the defending Super Bowl champions currently sit in last place.
In a 42-27 win over Tom Brady and crew in a game that went to midnight on the East Coast, the Kansas City Chiefs brought some real drama to the start of the 2017-18 regular season. But last year’s AFC West champs took some real hits too, with cornerback Marcus Peters getting blowback on social media and more for sitting in protest during the national anthem and Pro Bowl safety Eric Berry suffering a season-ending ruptured Achilles tendon in the matchup at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, MA.
Still, with a 14.6/25 in meter-market ratings, the beginning of the new NFL season was not exactly a winner for the league and NBC.
While better than anything on the Big 4 has done in the overnights in months, those numbers are down a sobering 12% from the early results of the Denver Broncos’ tight 21-20 victory over the Carolina Panthers in last year’s kickoff game on September 8, 2016.
Long season short, that’s not a good start for either the NFL or networks hoping to gain some traction from last year’s NFL ratings blows.
To put some greater context, the 2016 kickoff game, which was down from both the 2015 and the 2014 openers, went on to snare a 9.4/33 rating among adults 18-49 and 25.2 million viewers. With the eventual Super Bowl 50 champs 10 points down at one point before surging for the win, the Broncos-Panthers opener was the fourth year in a row that an NFL kickoff game topped 25 million viewers. With 27.5 million sets of eyeballs, the 2010 kickoff between the New Orleans Saints and Minnesota Vikings still holds the record for most-watched season opener since the traditional Thursday openers started in 2002.
Of course, last night’s 8:45 PM – midnight ET game comes off last season’s sacked ratings, as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell — who was booed and mocked by clown nose-sporting Patriots fans at last night — the Comcast-owned net and others are more than aware. Starting out in a 12% decline, a generous analysis had ratings for the 2016-17 season down around 8% overall from the year before in the end.
Before last night’s results, a sliver of hope had seemed to emerge as this year’s preseason games were up 5% over the 2016 exhibitions. Heading into Sunday Night Football on NBC this weekend, a lot of stock will be put in the big-market matchup between the NFC East rival New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys delivering the goods and the numbers to turn things around.
Until then, we’ll update with more of Thursday’s kickoff ratings as we get them throughout the day, along with Big Brother, Battle of the Network Stars and Beat Shazam results too. In the meantime, here are the Top 10 markets for last night’s game:
And, because we can all use a bit more Game of Thrones, since the Season 7 finale of the HBO blockbuster last month, here is a little something to put Patriots’ head coach Bill Belichick’s Thursday night in context:
Down 16% overall in the key demo from last year’s early numbers, which was down from the year before, those 8 – 11 PM results will surely change as time adjusted final numbers come in later today. Right now the game itself is delivering a 7.2/26 rating and 20.81 million viewers. That’s a 15% decline from the fast affiliates that the September 8, 2016 match-up between the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers pulled in. Again, if past kickoffs and live sporting events in general are any indication, expect Thursday’s demo and total viewership to change, especially being that the game went until midnight.
Having said that, the Kansas City Chiefs 42-27 victory over the New England Patriots in last night’s NFL kickoff game isn’t going to change and it is unlikely, based on the metered-market results earlier today, that the start of the league’s 98th season will bounce up to beat or match last year.
Adam Silver is correct, Millionaire NBA and NFL players have all the right to whine about how bad the United States of America treats them, but us Patriotic American Citizens also have the right to boycott the NFL, NBA and their sponsors.

"Nikki Haley told UN member states that Donald Trump will take a vote on his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital “personally,” and warned that she will be reporting back to him on those countries who vote against the US at the UN General Assembly.
Her warning was contained in a letter ahead of the General Assembly’s emergency session on the status of Jerusalem, scheduled to take place on Thursday.
Earlier the US ambassador to the UN also warned that the US plans to “take names” of its critics ahead of a GA session to debate Washington’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.
At the UN we’re always asked to do more & give more. So, when we make a decision, at the will of the American ppl, abt where to locate OUR embassy, we don’t expect those we’ve helped to target us.

On Monday, the Unites States was the only state out of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council to use its veto power to block a resolution that called on all states to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem.
The US continues to defend its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. The day before the emergency session, US envoy Nikki Haley sent a letter informing other countries’ representatives that all those objecting to the US position will be reported to President Donald Trump. Haley said the US leader will be “carefully” following the vote, according to Haaretz newspaper.
“As you consider your vote, I encourage you to know the president and the US take this vote personally,” the letter stated, according to the newspaper. “The president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those who voted against us,” she added.

Delivery delays also marred Amazon’s debut in July, when on-the-ground operations began with Prime Now two-hour deliveries. When accounting for orders placed on its main U. S. website, Amazon lags behind local web-store Lazada and its parent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
For the island country’s consumers, a store or a shopping center is usually just minutes away. In fact there are too many stores, with mall operators scaling back operations after years of over-expansion. While retailers blame a weaker economy and increased web shopping, the country of 5.6 million trails most of the developed world when it comes to e-commerce. Just 4.6 percent of Singapore’s retail sales took place online last year, compared with 15 percent in the U. K. and 10 percent in the U.S., according to Euromonitor International.
“Singaporeis a very small city-state, so shopping is one of the favorite pastimes for all Singaporeans,” saidChan Hock Fai, a fund manager at Amundi Asset Management. Because retailing is a more mature market in the country, compared with emerging retail and e-commerce markets, “growth rates are harder to come by,” he said.
At stake is a Southeast Asian e-commerce market that’s projected to reach $88 billion by 2025, according to a report by Google and Temasek Holdings Pte. While Amazon is firmly established in Japan, the web retailer has mostly ceded China to Alibaba and JD.com Inc. India remains a top priority, with Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos committing $5 billion to expand and vanquish local rival Flipkart Online Services Pvt. Australia could soon be another new market for Amazon.
“We’ve launched Prime Now in 50 cities across nine countries and Singapore is our biggest launch ever,”said Amanda Ip, a spokeswoman at Amazon Prime Now. “We are grateful for the exciting response from customers.”
Jin-Yan Ang, 29, is an Amazon Prime shopper who decided to use the service when he wanted to buy a Go-Pro action camera two days before going on vacation. After that, he also ordered chilled wine for a party and other daily necessities. “On the down side, Amazon Prime Now needs to improve the variety of offerings,” said Ang, a procurement manager.
In terms of scale, Lazada dwarfs Amazon locally, offering more than 30 million products compared with tens of thousands via Prime Now. The Asian online retailer, originally founded by Rocket Internet SE in 2011, has more than 6.6 million unique visitors a month and has seen orders triple from 2016.
“There is huge potential for the e-commerce industry in Singapore,” said Alexis Lanternier, Lazada Singapore’s CEO. “Online shopping in this market is certainly gaining traction here with 3 out of 5 people shopping online, and we believe this is the direction forward for the retail industry in Singapore.”
Although Singapore-based online retailers are relatively new, consumers there have been shopping online for years, getting their merchandise shipped directly from the U. S., China and other places. That’s why Lazada-Alibaba’s web stores had 988,000 unique visitors in August, followed by 698,000 for Amazon and 432,000 for Giosis Pte’s Qoo10, according to ComScore. Because the numbers don’t account for mobile orders, Amazon’s Prime Now sales aren’t included and weren’t disclosed by the company.
“While online shopping is really convenient, I prefer to buy things in-store.” said Lisa Tan, 32, a small business owner. “I like the experience — sights and even sounds — of shopping in stores. It’s definitely more convenient in Singapore; everything is pretty much within reach. I only shop online for things I can’t easily buy in Singapore and on sites like Taobao and Amazon.”
Amazon’s decision to introduce Prime Now first in Singapore underscores the need to get merchandise into the hands of shoppers as soon as possible. Usually, the web retailer introduces the rapid-delivery service after a market matures, when it’s able to build up a fast logistics network. In its limited free trial, consumers in Singapore can get tens of thousands of items delivered to their door with free delivery on orders of more than S$40 ($29). Previously, Singaporeans were only able to order select items on Amazon’s website, with some products subject to costly international shipping fees.
For web retailers, the lure of opening a physical store to cater to Singaporean shoppers is proving hard to ignore. Vivre Activewear, an exercise clothing brand that was first launched online in April 2014, decided to open a store two years ago because customers prefer to see “the real things,” according to Kevin Chia, the apparel maker’s co-founder. Now, 80 percent of the brand’s total revenue is derived from store sales, he said.
“You just need to be present for your shopper whenever she feels like she’s ready to buy,” said Ali Potia, who runs McKinsey & Co.’s Asia Consumer Insights Center.
Lazada has already teamed up with Singapore real-estate operator CapitaLand Ltd., letting people shop online and pick up merchandise at a nearby mall. “This closes the online-to-offline loop and gives customers the full shopping experience,” Lanternier said.
Amazon’s$13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods shows that it’s increasingly open to having a physical presence. In India, Amazon recently took a 5 percent stake in Shoppers Stop Ltd. with plans to open experience centers at the retailer’s stores for customers to try out products that are sold online.
“The main reason that shoppers continue to shop in a physical store is due to the in-store experience – something irreplaceable by e-commerce,” said Tan Kee Yong, managing director at AsiaMalls Management Pte, which operates six shopping centers in Singapore. The company’s Singapore malls attract a combined 7.2 million people each month, according to its website.",0
"Kid Rock’s name popped up at the Michigan Republican Party convention as a potential candidate for that state’s upcoming Senate race during their last party convention in February.
Yesterday morning the predictions came true. Musician Kid Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, officially announced his bid for the U. S. Senate in Michigan. He stated he has had a ton of emails and texts asking him if this website that had been leaked was indeed real, http://kidrockforsenate.com.
I have had a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real… https://t.co/RRVgISDFeq The answer is an absolute YES. pic.twitter.com/uYCUg6mjW1
So yesterday afternoon he twitted his answer, “The answer is an absolute YES.” And he later when on to twit, “I will have a major announcement in the near future.”
This is really great for our nation and the Republican Party. Kid Rock not only is a stand-up guy who has done a lot for our military, he also appeals to the dimwitted left side of the political aisle because you know, he sings.
If you research his songs and look into his lyrics, you can see that since he grew up in a middle-class setting in Northern Michigan himself, he perfectly captures the spirit of the American middle class. The very class that thanks to years of being neglected and stepped on by politicians on both sides of the political spectrum, is all but extinct in today’s America. These are the very people who came out in droves to vote for President Donald Trump during the 2016 Presidential Election, many of whom had never cared to vote before. In fact, if you watch his videos, many are loaded with Americana. I bet he wins in a landslide!
Kid Rock is an American singer, musician and record producer who came to fame with his unique blend of rap, heavy metal, and country rock.
Kid Rock’s musical journey is one that has encompassed underground Detroit rap, heavy metal and country rock, and by finding the perfect blend of all three, he turned an underwhelming career into a huge success. From early controversy over sexualized lyrics to selling 35 million records worldwide and marrying (and divorcing) Pamela Anderson, it’s been a wild ride for one of the wild men of rap.
Kid Rock was born Robert James Ritchie on January 17, 1971, in Romeo, Michigan, a small rural town north of the Detroit metro area. His father was a car dealer who owned a six-acre orchard where the young Ritchie would work along with his three siblings. He became interested in hip hop in the 1980s, joining a breakdance crew and teaching himself to rap and DJ. From there he began performing at local parties as part of a rap group called The Beast Crew and met D-Nice, a member of KRS-One’s Boogie Down Productions. This led to an opening slot at a BDP concert, and D-Nice, who was signed to Jive Records, helped Kid Rock land a deal with the same label.
Heavily influenced by the Beastie Boys and their classic Licensed to Ill, Kid Rock’s debut, Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast, was released in 1990. Rolling Stone would later include it in a list of “20 terrible debut albums by great artists,” criticizing it for being “so insistently generic it’s like he tossed everything current about hip hop in 1990 into a giant colander and sifted out all the individuality.” With production from Too Short and D-Nice, it achieved notoriety when an uncensored version of the album’s single “Yo-Da-Lin in the Valley” — a paean to oral sex — was played on a college radio station, leading to an FCC fine. Rock was released from his contract by Jive shortly afterwards.
His next two albums The Polyfuze Method (1993) and Early Mornin’ Stoned Pimp (1996) contained lyrics too filthy to play on the radio, but relentless touring and a gift for self-promotion earned Kid Rock a cult following. He’d also started to lean more heavily on country and rock in his samples, and decided to form his own band, Twisted Brown Trucker. He then signed to Atlantic Records, and in 1998 his fourth album, Devil Without a Cause, sold over 14 million copies in the wake of his breakthrough single, “Bawitdaba.” “We got such a diverse record,” Rock told an interviewer on its release. “I’m kicking old school rap songs and then I do a metal thing.” He started to open tours, and his Woodstock 1999 performance gave him even more exposure. Despite his 10 years as an artist, he was nominated for the best new artist award at the Grammys in 2000 — one of two nominations he failed to win that year.
His band member Joseph “Joe C” Calleja died in his sleep in 2000 — he had suffered most of his life from celiac disease — but Rock was able to keep the momentum going after a slow start on 2001’s Cocky, thanks in large part to the crossover country ballad “Picture,” which featured Sheryl Crow. The album featured more ballads than Devil Without a Cause, signaling another slight shift in sound. It sold more than 5 million copies, with Entertainment Weekly’s Rob Brunner calling it a “blend of low-rider hip-hop and strip-mall heavy metal.”
His self-titled Kid Rock album in 2003 was Ritchie’s last long-player that was recognizably hip hop. By early 2004 he was embroiled in controversy when he performed at the Super Bowl XXXVIII wearing a poncho made from the American flag. He was criticized by some groups for desecrating the flag, but much of the furor was ignored because of the bigger clamor around Janet Jackson’s “wardrobe malfunction” during the same show.
Rock n Roll Jesus (2007) said goodbye to hip hop and hello to Kid Rock’s first ever No. 1 album on the Billboard 200, selling over 5 million copies. He went even more country on 2010’s Born Free, produced by Rick Rubin and featuring Sheryl Crow and Bob Seger. Rebel Soul in 2012 was a reunion with the Twisted Brown Truckers band and his last album for Atlantic Records. His most recent release, First Kiss, came out on Warner Bros. Records in February 2015.
Kid Rock’s personal life has overshadowed his career at times. He began dating the former Baywatch actress Pamela Anderson in 2001. They became engaged in April 2002, ended their relationship in 2003, then reunited and married in July of 2006. Four months later both he and Anderson filed for divorce.
As for Kid rock’s legal troubles, he had been charged with assaulting a DJ in a strip club in 2005. Two years later, he was arrested with five members of his entourage outside a Waffle House in Atlanta after getting into a scuffle with a male customer. Rock was taken into custody on a misdemeanor charge of simple battery and was released that afternoon. This came only a month after he had brawled with the Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee — Pamela Anderson’s other ex-husband — at the 2007 Video Music Awards (Lee later referred to Rock as a “jealous country bumpkin”).
Rock has also clashed with animal rights activists over his love of hunting and was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump in the 2017 presidential election.
He still lives in Michigan, and is now a grandfather. His grown-up son, Robert James Ritchie Jr. — whose mother is Rock’s ex-girlfriend Kelley South Russell — has a daughter, Skye, born in 2014.
I have been saying this very thing for years. Take my home state of California for example, the only way we Republicans here can beat the ruthless California Democrat machine and their friends in the media is by running some kind of celebrity. We have an election for governor coming up where that pervert Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, who is being challenged by a bunch of duds from the Republican party, is a shoe-in to get at least 60% of the vote. Unless we can manage to get a celebrity to run.
Calling, Rob Lowe, Gary Sinise or Tom Selleck…. Please help us save our dying state like Chris Rock is trying to help Michigan.
Please share if you want to see Senator Rock….",1
"In 1995, the restaurateur Jonathan Morr opened a 3,800-square-foot noodle shop called Republic on Union Square Westin New York City, paying an annual rent of $220,000. “The rent was relatively inexpensive for what it was,” he said. “But remember, when I opened, Union Square was very different than it is today. There was very little therealong with the drugs in the park. At the time we were taking a risk.”
Twenty-two years later, Union Square has been gentrified beyond recognition. It'shome to a Whole Foods supermarket and an apartment building whose penthouse sold for more than $16 million.And now Republic ison its way out. Morr said he expects to close the space by the end of 2017, three and a half years before the lease expires. “It’s just a fact of life—there’s no way that we’re staying there after the lease is up,” he said. Taking advantage of an impatient landlord, Morr plans to leave the space earlyand will ""split the difference between what [the landlord] gets from us and what he’ll get from the next tenant, and call it a day,"" he said.
Republic is joining a slow but distinct restaurant exodus from the area, following in the footsteps of Danny Meyer's Union Square Cafe, whose prohibitively high rent forced it to search for a new space in 2015. ""There's no such thing as a New York restaurant that's immune to real estate,"" said Richard Coraine, the chief of staff for Union Square Hospitality Group. He notedthat the original, 1985 rent for USQ was $4,500 a month. A roughly fivefoldincrease over 30 years is whatpromptedMeyer to move his beloved restaurant to its current home, on a corner a few blocks northeast of Union Square.
The space currently occupied by Blue Water Grill, also on Union Square West, is being formally marketed to potential tenantsfor close to $2 million a year, according to Leslie Siben, a principal at LB Realty Services LLC, who has been approached about the property. ""There’s no way there won’t be a lot of turnover there as tenants who have been there for a really long time face the notion of 'fair market value,'"" she said, adding that the astronomical rents are an unsurmountable barrier to many potential food serviceoccupants. ""Think about those numbers: That area is going to have to become a food desert, [because] no normal restaurateur with any experience would touch that as it is now.""
""The rent at this location was just recently raised to well over $2 million,"" wrote a spokesperson for Landry's, the owner of Blue Water Grill.""Even though this is one of New York's most successful restaurants, it can't be successful with a $2 million plus rent; therefore, we will be relocating within the next year. In the meantime, it is business as usual.""
Rising rents and real estate turnover are hardly new phenomena, but Union Square West—along with other desirableresidential areas of New York such as Smith Street in Brooklyn and lower Bleecker Street in Manhattan—have seen their rents become so prohibitive that most of their restaurants—with the exception of chains, or flagship “loss-leaders”—are forced to move elsewhere.
Twenty years ago, Union Square West representedthe most dynamicculinary blocks in New York. Republic was a very early pan-Asian restaurant with a focus on noodles and bowls,where thebestselling Pad Thai cost about $6 and the most expensive dish was marinated salmon on rice for $8.Blue Water Grill, set in a former bank, specialized ingrand seafood tableaus. The Coffee Shop Bar, which opened in 1990,featured towering models servingmojitos, plantain chips, andpressed sandwicheslate into the night. (Coffee Shop Bar looks like it will remain open, but the original Heartland Brewery, which hadlived next door to Republic since 1995, closed on New Year's Day2015.) For people looking for future food trends around the city, Union Square West was the place to be.
Nowthe storefronts around those restaurants have been taken up by Starbucks and Dylan's Candy Bar, and rumors are that yet more spaces will soon have a For Rent sign out front.“When rents go up, it makes the viability of restaurants harder,” said Stephen Sunderland, the senior managing director of Optimal Spaces, a tenant broker in the city. “You have to think of restaurants as artists, or neighborhood pioneers,” he explained. “They come into a neighborhood, it becomes hip, and that’s the source of their demise,” he said. “They create the trends that undo them.”
Restaurant leases tend to be on 15-year terms, which means that to outside observers,a ""food desert""can appearto creep up without warning. A neighborhood is seen as upandcoming, and exciting restaurants begin to move in. Roughly two decades later, when leases come up, prices spike because gentrification followed, and those restaurants are forced out. The net effect is a replacement ofindependentfood entrepreneurs with a smattering of chain restaurants.
“What happens to a retail neighborhood where there’s nowhere to eat?” asked Sunderland rhetorically. “The desirability goes down” for future residents.
Morr, the co-owner of Republic, said that about 80 percent of his revenue comes from foodand only 20 percent from alcohol, which is traditionally much more lucrative. “Republic was about the food, not the alcohol,” he said, which meant that to pay rent and turn a profit, it had to serve a vast number of dishes a day. “The volume was tremendous,” he said. “Like 1,200 bowls [of noodles] a day” to diners who crowded into long bench tablesand shuffled in and out relatively speedily.
For restaurants that lack the space or the ability to turn over customers as quickly, the math is even more daunting. “The simple math used to revolve around rent being 10 percent of sales at most,” said Robert Guarino, the manager partner of 5 Napkin Burger, which has four locations in New York, one of which is around the corner from Union Square.
“So take the example of a $1.5 million annual rent,"" Guarino explains.""That means you need to make $15 million a year in sales.” Break it down on a daily basis, he said, and assuming the restaurant is open 365 days a year, you need 822 customers a day spending $50 per person, on average, or, if the fare is cheaper, 1,644 people a day spending $25 a day, on average. “It's not easy to get to $15 million in sales by just serving lunch and dinner in a standard sit-down format,” he said.
Laurent Gras, a chef and consultant who opened the restaurant L2O in Chicago, said the financials can be punishingwhen it comes to fine dining. “You’re supposed to make your rent in one night,” he said. For example: a $1.5 million annual rent means that a single day’s rent is $4,100. On top of that, there are additional costs namely labor and food, Gras said, meaning that on a single day a restaurant would need to bring in tens of thousands of dollars more than its daily rent.
For Morrand Republic, recent rent increases represented a tipping point, whereby he was profiting less from his business than his landlord. “When we opened Republic, we made six, seven, even eight times what the landlord made,” he said. Nowthat's changed dramatically.“Even if you do the math and make money a little bit, you don’t want to make less than what the landlord’s making.""
Marty Feinberg, whose company Winner Communications owns Republic's building, noted that taxes have gone up dramatically on the building since the restaurant first signed its lease. ""Taxes have gone from $90,000 to $476,000,"" he said. ""Yes, it's gone up in value since I bought it in 1983, and rents have escalated dramatically, but people are paying them,"" he continued. ""And people are paying because they can still make money. People aren't renting space to lose money.""
Not many neighborhoods in New York or Brooklyn are left to gentrify.As a result, Sunderland, the broker, said that both landlords and restaurateurs are looking for alternative business models. One of the most appealing, he said, is food halls: “They lower the barrier to entry,” he said. “Instead of spending $300,000 to $500,000 in fixed costs, they’re probably paying a slightly higher percentage of their revenue, but they can open in a food hall for very little money.It’s limited risk, both incoming and outgoing: If the landlord takes someone and no one wants their food, after a couple of months they can just say, ‘hey, I can’t pay my rent,’ and leave.”
Because restaurant leases are on a 15 year cycle—avirtual eternity in the ever-changing character of a neighborhood—the impact of rent increases can last for decades. “There are always trends and countervailing trends,” said Sunderland. “Look at Madison Avenue: How many restaurants are there? Very few. And chances are the ones that are there are equity owners in the buildings. You don’t see new restaurants moving into that area.”
""Everyone isn't leaving,"" said Feinberg, the building owner. ""But even if they do, in due time rents would stabilize at a level that people feel comfortable with, and they'll all fill up again. It's not going to be the end of the neighborhood.""
Morr, for his part, isn’t sure if he’ll reopen Republic once he leaves. “Listen, if the rents weren’t that crazy, we could have stayed there forever,” he said. “Maybe we should all just become landlords instead.”",0

"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Chelsea Handler took a shot at President Donald Trump when she hosted the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's annual grants dinner on Wednesday.
""Let's celebrate the three things Donald Trump hates the most: Foreigners, the press and actually giving money to charity,"" Handler said at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where more than a dozen film and TV stars helped the group behind the Golden Globe Awards share proceeds from the show with some 55 film schools and arts organizations.
Dustin Hoffman, Patrick Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Ava DuVernay, Elizabeth Moss, Chrissy Metz, Bob Odenkirk, Anthony Mackie and Mark Hamill were among the entertainers who appeared to discuss the various charities that benefit from HFPA grants.
Stan Lee seemed to enjoy the spotlight, playfully going off-script as he appeared alongside ""Black Panther"" star Chadwick Boseman.
""I got news for you: I'm half deaf and half blind, so forgive whatever I say,"" the 94-year-old Marvel mastermind said as he took the stage. ""Chad is gonna be my crutch, so be kind to him. I need the guy.""

After Finding US Troops Embedded With ISIS, Russia Issues Blunt Warning: Leave Syria Now, Or Die
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
An absolutely stunning Ministry of Defense (MoD) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, this past week, held an unprecedented secret face-to-face meeting with US Secretary of Defense James Mattis at the Al Udeid Air Base, in Qatar, where the Americans were bluntly warned by Russia: leave Syria now, or die.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, Secretary of Defense of Mattis used the cover of his trip to India this week to meet with Defence Minister Shoigu in Qatarand that the US mainstream propaganda media was not aware of as the Pentagon has cut off nearly all contact with their military leader and the press.
Necessitating this unprecedented face-to-face meeting, this report continues, were the events surrounding the death of Captain Kurban Kasumov, of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), on 2 Augustand who was operating in the Deir ez-Zor battle zone of Syriathat the MoD has previously designated as the Battle For The Monastery they have said will decide the fate of the world.
Upon the battlefield death of Captain Kasumov, this report details, the MoD ordered a massive drone surveillance operation to be conducted over the entire Deir ez-Zor regionand that between 8-12 September, shockingly revealed US Special Operations troops embedded, aiding and fighting with ISIS terrorists.

In publically releasing, just hours, ago the drone surveillance photos proving US Special Operations forces are working hand-in-hand with ISIS terrorists in Syria, the MoD further stated that despite the strongholds of these US Special Forces being located where ISIS troops are currently deployed, there are not even signs of the organization of a battle outpostmeaning that these US military troops felt absolutely safe in the area held by these Islamic terrorists.
After these US-led Islamic terror forces launched a brazen attack upon Russian Military Police Forces on 20 September, this report continues, the Americans were further warned by Russia that they faced swift retribution for their actionsbut with the US military blaming the CIA for these atrocities, not themselves.
In his meeting with Defense Secretary Mattis, however, this report says, Defense Minister Shoigu stated that Russian military forces operating in Syria would not make such distinctions about which American entity should be retaliated against (either US military or CIA), and his warning that all of them would be targetedand that caused the key American military base in Syrias southwestern desert region (Zeqaf Base) to be rapidly abandoned and destroyed by fleeing US military forces and their Islamic terror allies, and further battlefield reports showing the Americans are rapidly planning to abandon and destroy their Al-Tanf Base in Syria too.
With Russia pouring into Syria massive numbers of tanks and military fighting vehicles, along with deploying advanced Russian-made air defense systems, this report notes, the US-backed Islamic terror forces in Syria are continuing their vast withdraw before Syrian Arab Army forces in both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa Provincesand to such an extent that Russian allied forces in Syria have now reached the milestone of crossing the Euphrates River.
In preparation for this war nearing its end, this report further details, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has, once again, told the Americans to leave Syriabecause unlike Russia, the US is operating there in violation of international law.
In the furtherance of peace in Syria, too, this report continues, Saudi Arabian King Salman Al Saud is in the final preparations for his historic trip to Russia, while at the same time, Defense Minister Shoigu will make a rare visit to Israel to meet with his counterpart, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Libermanand with the agenda of both of these meetings seeking to find a way to end the United States catastrophic Middle East wars that have killed and maimed millions.
Astonishingly, this report concludes by noting that the American people are still being kept from knowing the true facts of what is now occurring in Syriaand who are, instead, having their heads filled with yet another hysterical mental breakdown generated by their mainstream propaganda media having to do with football players kneelingthat is confusing to understand as when Christian football players (like Tim Tebow) kneeled to honor God, the leftists became outraged, but who today, and after President Trump derided them, football players kneeling to disrespect the American flag are now being praised.
American football players are slammed by the leftist media if they kneel to honor God
but praised when they kneel to disrespect the American flag.

"The United States has concocted a new terror threat, known as the Khorasan Group, to satisfy the UN Charter which allows the use of force without authorization in case of an “imminent threat,” says an analyst.
“The very idea of the Khorasan Group is a fiction spun out of thin air to satisfy the UN Charter, which specifies that one nation may not attack another without UN Security Council approval, unless it is confronted by an ‘imminent threat’,” political commentator James Henry Fetzer told Press TV via email on Monday.
Fetzer, professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota Duluth, explained that the fabrication of this latest threat by the US to justify its bombing campaign in Syria is in line with “a reversal of US foreign policy” since Sept.11, 2001 attacks.
“We must bear in mind that 9/11 was brought to us by the CIA, the neo-cons in the Department of Defense and the Mossad to justify a reversal of US foreign policy where we had never attacked any nation that had not attacked us first to one in which we became an aggressor nation — and our military engagements have not let up, where we are carrying out the plan to destabilize six Arab nations.”
In recent weeks, the Khorasan Group has been described by US intelligence officials as posing the most immediate threat to the US homeland.
FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the United States was preparing for an imminent attack by the Khorasan Group.
Army Lt. Gen. William C. Mayville Jr., the Pentagon’s director for operations, warned late last month that the terrorist group was nearing “the execution phase of an attack either in Europe or the homeland.”
“The claim by the new director of the FBI that the Khorasan Group is planning to attack the US (but he can’t say whether that might be in days, weeks or months) is simply more transparent nonsense being espoused by government officials in their fabricated attempts to justify US bombing in Syria, which is designed to weaken President Bashar al-Assad, not destroy ISIL which is a creation of the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel,” Fetzer said.
“As Victoria Nuland of the Department of State confirmed during a national news program recently, we are not there to help Assad but to bring about regime change,” he added.
“Playing upon the gullibility of the American people, this non-existent threat was created for the sake of being able to claim non-violation of the UN Charter,” the analyst emphasized.
The US and several of its Arab allies — Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, — have been conducting airstrikes against ISIL militants inside Syria since Sept. 22 without any authorization from Damascus or a UN mandate.
Fetzer stressed that the air campaign is primarily aimed at Syria’s infrastructure “to leave Assad in a severely weaken condition.”",1

Cleopatra wore them. Elizabeth Taylor loved them. Egyptians believed they could bring eternal life. Though diamonds enjoy the reputation of being a girl's best friend, emeralds in fact are more rare -- and more valuable.
""Sought after for their rich color, regal history and identifiable look, emeralds are one of the most iconic gemstones in the jewelry industry,"" Amanda Gizzi, a spokesperson for Jewelers of America, a New York-based trade association, said in an email.

On April 25, the public will have the opportunity to own some of the most magnificent and valuable emeralds in the world, when they go up for sale at Guernsey's auction house in New York.
With more than 20 cut and raw stones and 13 spectacular pieces of jewelry, the rare emeralds on offer all come from a single collection that was compiled by emerald specialist Manuel Marcial de Gomar throughout his long career in the emerald industry.

One of the highlights of the sale is a collection of cut emeralds from the great Spanish shipwreck Nuestra Seora de Atocha, a galleon that sank off the Florida coast in 1622. The wreck is considered ""the most valuable known shipwreck in history,"" according to the catalog accompanying the sale, largely thanks to its numerous Muzo emeralds, which are prized for their deep, clear green.
Sunken treasure
When treasure hunter Mel Fisher set out to retrieve the galleon's lost bounty in the 1980s, he hired Marcial to help him appraise the stones and jewels salvaged from the ship's wreckage.
Several of these stones, given to Marcial as payment for his work, are on offer in the Guernsey's sale, and include the Nine Pillars of Andes, a group of nine rough stones totaling over 91 carats and carrying an estimated price of $2.5 million to $3.5 million; and the 4.39 carat Queen of the Sea, estimated to sell for $250,000 to $350,000.

Also included in the sale is the 887-carat La Gloria, which Guernsey's bills as ""one of the largest museum-quality emeralds in the world,"" (estimate $4-5 million); and the Marcial de Gomar Star Emerald, the largest star emerald ever found (estimate $2-3 million), notable for its double-sided cabochon, and one of only 11 star emeralds known to exist.

Also included in the sale is the 887-carat La Gloria, which Guernsey's bills as ""one of the largest museum-quality emeralds in the world,"" (estimate $4-5 million); and the Marcial de Gomar Star Emerald, the largest star emerald ever found (estimate $2-3 million), notable for its double-sided cabochon, and one of only 11 star emeralds known to exist.
Unique and untouched
Trends in jewelry that see a rising popularity in colored stones have also made emeralds especially desirable in recent years. In fact, Gizzi predicted 2017 ""will be a big year"" for colored stones, including emeralds.
Members of the beryl family of minerals, emeralds obtain their rich green color through chromium, vanadium or iron deposits in the mines. In the process, most stones form inclusions, tiny fractures or bubbles within their structure that can make them especially fragile.

While the best emeralds, like the best diamonds, are ""clear,"" or inclusion-free, emerald connoisseurs generally also appreciate some inclusions, which they refer to as ""jardins,"" French for ""gardens."" Nevertheless, because the general buyer does tend to prefer clear stones, many commercial jewelers treat their emeralds to make the jardins less visible.

The gems of the Marcial de Gomar collection have not been subjected to such manipulations. The loose emeralds -- some cut, others rough -- represent some of the best natural stones to emerge from the world's mines, according to Guernsey's.
The making of a collection
Marcial's collection reaches far beyond the stones themselves, however. In addition to several gold and silver coins, also salvaged from the Atocha wreck, the Guernsey's sale features spectacular jewelry, designed by Marcial himself, such as the Corona de Muzo, which includes a 24.34-carat emerald from the wreck, combined with smaller emeralds and diamonds (estimate $5-6 million).

Or there is the extraordinary Conquistadora, crafted of 889 diamonds and 35 emeralds, which can be worn both as a necklace and as a tiara (estimate $150,000 to $250,000). That the auction is also being held online as well as in New York may seem odd to some: It is risky business, after all, to bid millions of dollars for a necklace or a raw gemstone you haven't seen.

However, Ettinger said, ""Some bidders do indeed purchase very expensive objects without viewing them in person."" Alternatively, he added, ""The emeralds are in our Manhattan vault, and can be seen any time between now and April 25.""",0

"According to the article headlined “US Army operated biological weapons in Germany,” the German newspaper Bild reported that the US military used deadly live anthrax spores in military exercises.
Sputnik News reports: The investigation revealed that several ofthe US military exercises onGerman soil involved “incidents” inwhich live anthrax spores were released. The incidents took place inthe town ofLandstuhl, nearFrance, Luxembourg and the Ramstein military base. The US military previously sent live anthrax spores toSouth Korea.
The German defense ministry told the newspaper that the spores were not sent toany German military laboratories. The US military previously admitted that since2005 it sent anthrax spores toSouth Korea, Australia and Canada, butnot Germany.
“According to current information, Bundeswehr servicemen were not put in danger,” the German defense ministry claimed in an inquiry to Bild.
The spores were supposed to be neutralized at the Dugway Proving Ground in the US state of Utah before being sent to the exercises, but the incident made “some spores even more active,” according to the newspaper.",1
"On June 8, a coalition airstrike on pro-Assad forces near al-Tanf destroyed a tank and several artillery systems.
Allied forces of the Syrian government army, which includes the forces of Lebanon’s Hezbollah as well as Iran, threatened the US-led coalition with a retaliatory strike.
On May 18, the US-led coalition struck pro-Assad fighters near al-Tanf in the area of an established de-confliction zone with Russia. The strikes occurred near al-Tanf, where US’ and British special operations forces have been training Syrian rebel fighters near the border with Iraq and Jordan. The second similar incident took place near al-Tanf on June 6.
The US State Department said that the strike was carried out as self-defense and was not indicative of an escalation.
“Nevertheless, the Pentagon’s strikes on Syrian forces have recently been regular, from the Shairat air base in April to al-Tanf in May and June. It does not seem to be self-defense,” Russian political commentator Alexander Khrolenko wrote in an op-ed for Sputnik.
The Syrian Foreign Ministry called the attack a crime committed bythe “illegitimate US-led international coalition.” Damascus stressed that forthree years the US and its allies have been carrying outan anti-Daesh operation withoutauthorization fromthe Syrian government.
An operational headquarters ofthe allied forces ofthe Syrian government army, which includes the forces ofLebanon’s Hezbollah aswell asIran, threatened the US-led coalition witha retaliatory strike followingthe attacks onDamascus positions.
Moscow slammed the coalition attack asa violation ofinternational law. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the move was an act ofaggression, undermining Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Currently, the Syrian Army and its allies are advancing tothe east alongthe Damascus-Baghdad highway, a strategic route insoutheast Syria. The highway is also a point ofinterest forthe US-led coalition inthe area ofal-Tanf, where Syria borders withIraq and Jordan.
The eastern part ofthe Damascus-Baghdad highway and border crossings are controlled byUS-backed opposition forces. If the Syrian Army enters al-Tanf the strategic situation inthe region will significantly change.
The US has a military base inal-Tanf, which facilitates the maneuvering offorces inIraq and enables control ofa large part ofPalmyra province.
“If necessary forces from al-Tanf could quickly reach Damascus along the highway. There are just 270 kilometers between al-Tanf and the Syrian capital. It is unlikely that Washington has completely abandoned the military scenario for the Syrian crisis,” Khrolenko wrote.
US-backed opposition forces will stay nearal-Tanf untilDaesh is completely defeated inthe area ofthe Euphrates. Nevertheless, the Pentagon said earlier that the build-up ofcoalition presence inthe region was due topossible threats fromSyrian forces.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Army and its allies have launched an offensive insouthern Syria, ina bid toreach the border withIraq and Jordan nearal-Tanf. At the same time, Syrian opposition forces moved fromal-Tanf towardDeir ez-Zor. Iranian news agency Fars News reported that over150 US and British military specialists entered Syria fromJordan tosupport the offensive.
The Pentagon said that the US-Russian channel onthe safety offlights overSyria did not work outnear al-Tanf due to “aggressive acts” ofpro-Damascus forces. At the same time, ina press release, the coalition described the attack asa strike onDaesh terrorists.
“It is clear that inSyria the US tries toweaken the capability ofthe Syrian Army and wants tostop its offensive onal-Tanf. The coalition strikes onthe Syrian Army and its allies were deliberate,” the author pointed out.
According toLebanese media outlet An Nahar, further developments inthe region will determine the decision onthe Syrian settlement.
Russia, Turkey and Iran are working onde-escalation zones inSyria and do not recognize so-called “de-conflict areas” unilaterally declared bythe US.
“If the coalition further creates problems forthe process ofpeaceful settlement open confrontation is possible nearal-Tanf. If so the Syrian Army and Iran may attack coalition forces and US-backed opposition groups,” Khrolenko concluded.",1
"An earlier version of this story gave an inaccurate amount for the possible annual salary Ellen Pao might have earned as a senior partner at Kleiner Perkins.
SAN FRANCISCO — The very large sums of money at stake for those working at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins were discussed on the stand Thursday in the third day of a gender discrimination case that has Silicon Valley agog.
Ellen Pao, a former junior partner, is suing the well-known venture capital firm for $16 million in back pay and future wage losses after, she says, she was dismissed from her position in October 2012.
In 2011, Pao made more than $500,000, Kleiner attorney Lynne Hermle said.
Junior partners get paid a salary as well as bonuses. Senior, or general partners, get profits from Kleiner's investments, Kleiner Perkins' chief financial officer, Susan Biglieri said from the stand.
If Pao had been promoted to senior partner, like the three male counterparts hired around the same time as her, she could have made as much as $2.6 million a year.
Biglieri confirmed that senior partners at the VC firm, which funds early-stage companies, make between three and five times what junior partners do.
Pao became the CEO of Reddit, a popular news aggregation site, in November. Her salary there has not been reported.
Pao's complaint asserts that at Kleiner Perkins she was denied promotion, wages and profits because she was a woman, and that she and other women were excluded from business meetings and opportunities, and from managerial functions because they were female.
The trial is of great interest to the technology industry because of rising concerns over the lack of women, African Americans and Hispanics in Silicon Valley in positions of power and influence.
Each day reporters from multiple media and technology sites write and Tweet from the courtroom, detailing the allegations and revelations made.
Kleiner Perkins general partner Ted Schlein took the stand in the afternoon. He became her manager in 2009.
Several times he said Pao was difficult to get along with, saying at one point, ""Ellen usually had issues with junior partners, and sometimes senior partners.""
Alan Exelrod, one of Pao's lawyers, went over a crucial 2011 performance review of Pao that Schlein helped put together, which her complaint characterized as ""biased.""
Exelrod introduced as evidence several iterations of the review, showing that it had grown progressively less positive with each revision.
During the afternoon's proceedings, details also emerged about a 2011 flight that Pao, Schlein and others took in a private jet. During the trip, Pao alleges, she was subjected to discussion of porn stars and visits to the Playboy Mansion, and senior staff present did nothing to bring the discussion around to more appropriate topics.
Exelrod asked about the plane ride, during which Dan Rosensweig, whose company Chegg Kleiner Perkins had invested in, spent time talking about ""matters relating to porn stars and Playboy bunnies,"" in Exelrod's words.
Schlein said that he recalled, ""Dan telling me he met Christie Hefner at the Playboy Mansion.""
When Exelrod asked if Schlein remembered Rosensweig talking about going to a Victoria's Secret lingerie show, he replied, ""I don't remember.""
When Exelrod asked if he'd done anything to try to get Rosensweig to end the conversation, Schlein testified, ""I don't remember trying to stop it.""",0
"A nation that winks at criminal activities is a society on the decline.Criminals and those who benefit by their actions often resort to efforts to downplay the seriousness of the offenses or even to assert that the crimes being committed are of an alleged benefit.The bootleggers of the 1920s were well known for donating a portion of their ill-gotten gains to charitable institutions. That some benefited was true, but that doesn’t excuse the criminal acts themselves.
Problems with our border with Mexico involve more that just illegal immigrants entering the country.Drug lords ship their products into the our country over that border, or sometimes, under it as we are learning.
It turns out that,“Mexican cartels use a number of innovative means to smuggle both humans and drugs into the United States, though the latest discovery by the Border Patrol has many scared to death. The Border Patrol Entry Team, aka ‘tunnel rats,’ recently announced the discovery of 224 tunnels that run from Mexico into California and Arizona.”
That’s a lot of tunnels. And a lot of tunneling to create them. All you need is a building on either side of the border and some folks to dig the tunnel to connect them, and your illicit business’ most difficult distribution problem is solved. That is until some law enforcement agency discovers the tunnel and fills it up with concrete.
These things aren’t cheap to create either. In fact,“the Drug Enforcement Agency estimates that these tunnels cost $1 million to $2 million a piece and that they can generate several more millions in revenue if they are used without being detected. Some even have lighting and a rail system.”Someone is clearly making a lot of money if it pays to create over 200 of these things.
Donald Trump has been labeled xenophobic and racist for his promises to seal the border with Mexico such that only legal cargo and authorized individuals enter the country. Of course these accusations are nonsense. We are not talking about race, religion, or anything else here.
The point is to eliminate a distribution network whereby criminals bring cocaine, heroin, and marijuana into our country along with persons who have no permission to enter.Race or religion has nothing to do with the drugs, and those transporting them as well as those entering the country illegal are criminals regardless of their ethnicity or religion.
That this has to be explained repeatedly is not only a waste of time, but illustrates the obdurate attitudes of those on the left who cannot come to terms with the truth that some people do bad things and need to be stopped. Until they figure that out, we, and our president, have our work cut out for us.",1
"Which cities will lead the economy of tomorrow? And who will decide? Often it's an amorphous mass of companies and people over time, drifting to where land is cheap and weather is warm. Sometimes it's one company, choosing in one moment. Like now, when Amazon decides where to locate itssecond corporate headquarters.
The scale of Amazon.com Inc.'s undertaking -- over time, needing up to 8 million square feet of office space and 50,000 well-paid employees -- is unlike anything seen in recent memory. The only thing comparable would be cities bidding for the Summer Olympics. Amazon's Request for Proposalnarrows the list significantly in terms of the number of cities realistically able to bid for such a project.
First, the labor force needs for the headquarters dramatically shrink the number of metro areas able to bid. Amazon says it's considering metro areas of a million or more, but realistically to provide 50,000 employees a metro area is going to need to be significantly larger than that.
Consider a place like Pittsburgh. Its metro area is2.35 million people, and its labor force is1.2 million. But the size of its labor force hasn't grown in 25 years. Even with the talent its well-respected universities produce … is Amazon, a company that thinks of growth in terms of decades, going to locate a headquarters in a place where it might have to hire over 4 percent of the metro area's labor force with uncertainty over whether that labor force will ever grow?
The next factor that will reduce the list of possibilities is the need for a suitable international airport. It's hard to say what exactly constitutes an international airport -- you can fly from Hartford, Connecticut, to Canada -- but as with everything Amazon does, higher volumesor higher capacity will probably be seen as more favorable. The list of most-trafficked international airports is full of the usual suspects --large coastal cities and major airline hubs. One additional factor to consider is that the airlines with thehighest market share in Amazon's hometown of Seattleare Alaska Airlines, which serves primarily West Coast destinations, and Delta Air Lines, which is based in Atlanta.
Once you've winnowed the list to large metropolitan areas with robust international airports, other considerations come into play. Amazon says ""a highly educated labor force is critical and a strong university system is required."" Would that takecities like Dallas and Charlotte out of consideration, or would being a couple hours from highly respected universities be good enough?
Costs are stated as an important factor as well. It's ""easy"" to identify large metro areas with robust airports and deep, educated talent pools, but those tend to be tremendously expensive. Being in Seattle, Amazon surely sees how much being based in Seattle, which is cheaper than the San Francisco Bay Area, helps with recruiting. It might make sense for an expansion of five thousand employees, but will Amazon really try to hire 50,000 employees in a metro like Vancouver, San Francisco, Toronto, Boston, New York or Washington -- an area that's already expensive?
Tax incentives play a role too. To some extent this is a question of ""who wants it the most."" For all other considerations, Chicago would be an attractive destination. But the city and state are broke. Are Chicago and Illinoiswilling to offer billions of dollars in tax incentives, trying to compete with younger, ""hungrier"" Sun Belt metros? And Chicago's another metro area with no clear prospects for labor force growth, even if its existing talent base is large and deep.
There are some softer cultural factors that are difficult to quantify as well. Will flirtations with anti-gay laws under a guise of ""religious liberty"" (and anti-trans ""bathroom bills"") hurt the causes of the large metro areas in North Carolina, Georgia and Texas? Will Toronto's case be helped or hurt by the political environment under President Donald Trump? (After all, he has waged a personal war against Amazon.) Will Washington's case be strengthened by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos's purchase of the Washington Post? Will geographic diversity -- perhaps a place in a time zone other than Pacific -- be seen as attractive?
This is the Olympics of corporate relocations. The winning city will be able to offer a large metro area, a deep and educated talent pool with a strong local university system, a robust international airport, sufficient highway and transit infrastructure, a reasonable cost of living, a welcoming culture, a business-friendly environment, likely eye-popping tax incentives, and a local business and political community able to work together to make a convincing pitch.
By my tally, the options are: Toronto, Boston, Washington, Atlanta, Dallas or Denver.

"SAN FRANCISCO— As many as 126 million people — or one-third the U. S. population —may have seen material posted by a Russian troll farmunder fake Facebook identities between 2015 and 2017, according to testimony  presented by Facebook's general counsel at a hearing before the Senate on Tuesday.
The figure is the largest yet of the possible reach Russian operatives had on the giant social platformin the run-up to last year's presidential election and afterwardsand reflects Facebook's new disclosures that a Kremlin-linked misinformation agency used original content in users' feeds, as well as paid ads. Previously Facebook said 10 million people saw Russia-linked advertising that sought to sway U. S. voters.
The figures come as Capitol Hill readies itself for two more hearings on the ways Russia used social media to influence the U. S. 2016 election, scheduled to take place on Wednesday.
Social media companiesare under pressure to respond to demands by lawmakers that they follow the same regulations on political ads as advertisers in newspapers and on radio and television currently do, including disclosures about who paid for the ads and bans on foreignentitiesrunning election-related ads. Facebook, Googleand Twitter have all said they would begin doing so, though lawmakers have pushed for additional concessions.
More: Facebook makes political ads more transparent ahead of Russia hearings
Twitter, which originally said it found 201 accounts linked to Russiathat weresending out automated, election-related content, also increased its estimates of the reach these operatives had on its platform. It has now found36,746 such accounts, according to testimony to be presented by thecompany’s acting general counsel Sean Edgett.
In a blog post Monday about its testimony for Tuesday, Google reported that it had found18 YouTube channels it believes were associated with the campaign.
The companies'testimony beforethe Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorismshows that Russian attempts to influenceU. S. votersby usingthe power of social media platforms and an understanding of hot-button social issueswas much broader than originally thought..
The goal, said Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, was ""to try to sow division and discord — and to try to undermine our election process.""
The Russia propaganda machine used a mix of ads and original posts. Facebook says an estimated11.4 million people in the United States saw at least one ad that was paid for by the Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency between Jan. 2015 and August 2017.
More: House Intel leaders to release Facebook ads purchased by Kremlin-linked groups
But the number of U. S. residents who saw ads was dwarfed by the estimated 29 million people who got content the firm generated and sharedin their Facebook News Feeds.
And because people frequently share, like and forward material, Facebook estimates that approximately 126 million people might have seen this divisive material during the two years in which the group was using Facebook to placeads and distribute postings.
""Many of the ads and posts we've seen so far are deeply disturbing — seemingly intended to amplify societal divisions and pit groups of people against each other. They would be controversial even if they came from authentic accounts in the United States. But coming from foreign actors using fake accounts they are simply unacceptable,"" Stretch's testimony said.
Ads focused on issues across the ideological spectrum, ""from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights,"" Stretch said.
The Internet Research Agency is a St. Petersburg-basedorganization that posts Russia-government approved propaganda online, under fake identities, according to U. S. intelligence officials.
The postings werestill onlya small portion of the material that Facebook users see every day, he cautioned, equal to about0.004%or one in 23,000 pieces of Facebook content that users see in their News Feeds.
Twitter says the Russia-related accounts sent “approximately 1.4 million automated, election-related Tweets,” which were seen by approximately 288 million Twitter users.
Edgett emphasized these were just 0.012% of the total accounts on Twitter at the time and that the tweets sent by these Russian-linked automated accounts constituted less than 0.74% of all election-related Tweets.
Google found two accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency which spent a total of $4,700 on its platforms during the 2016 election cycle, it said in a blog post Monday.
The company also found 18 YouTube channels it believes were associated with the campaign. These channels uploaded political videos that represented 43 hours of content. They got 309,000 U. S. views from June 2015 to November 2016. The company noted that a single user might have viewed one video multiple times so it’s likely fewer people actually saw them.
It also found evidence that Gmail accounts “associated with the campaign were used to open accounts on other platforms” and has shared information about those accounts with the other platforms.
Facebook also revealed that in the late summer it began to see fake personas being created on the platform by a group linked to a Russian hacking group that has been publicly linked to Russian military intelligence services.
Those fake personas were being used to ""seed stolen information to journalists"" and were organized under the banner of a group that called itself DC Leaks, according to the Facebook testimony. The stolen information included information and files stolen by hacking into the email accounts of former White House chief of staffJohn Podesta'sand theDemocratic National Committee.",0
"Russia has said that US security services must provide a full response to WikiLeaks’ accusations regarding hacking by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday that US spy agencies must be held fully accountable followingthe recent revelationsabout the CIA’s hacking techniques, adding that if found to be truethe acts of espionage by Washington represent “a great” danger to the world.
“If this information is confirmed, it would be desirable for the US security services to respond fully and adequately to the released documents with specific facts,” Zakharova told a briefing, adding “And if this information is confirmed, then this is a great danger to the world and international security”
On March 7, whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks published the first part of the Vault 7 series, which constituted thousands of documents from the CIA that purportedly revealed the agency’s hacking and spying secrets.
The leaked files show that US spy agency appeared to have developed or collected techniques to hack into Mac OS X, Windows, Linux computer operating systems, as well as Android and iOS software for mobile phones. The agency had also apparently devised a technique to target smart TV sets, having them record audio and send it to CIA servers.
The whistle-blowing website says the Vault 7 series will be the biggest leak of secret CIA data.
“If this information is correct, and we periodically learn that what the US special services are doing and amusing themselves with has always been confirmed… it is extremely dangerous, first of all from the standpoint of simply undermining the existing system of international relations,” Zakharova said.
“Accordingly, if these actions are confirmed, they simply undermine the trust that has been built with such difficulty between the countries,” she emphasized.
The Kremlin has already said that it will take into account leaks about US attempts to wiretap Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“We naturally turned our attention to these published data together with the entire international community. Of course, they deserve attention and they must be carefully read,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday.
He added, however, that the latest leaks were nothing new.
“As you know, in Washington they do not hide the fact that they actively wiretap Russian officials. They wiretap our Ambassador [Sergei] Kislyak and so on. No one is hiding this. Therefore, one does not need opening WikiLeaks, one could have guessed,” Peskov noted.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has also described the revelations as “quite plausible.”
“As for reports on the CIA’s hacking arsenal, of course, we saw them… I proceed from the assumption that experts consider this information quite plausible,” Lavrov said on Thursday.
The US has yet to confirm the authenticity of the leaks, but the White House has slammed the release of data, calling for those responsible for the revelations to be held accountable.
Edward Snowden, former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor turned whistleblower, says the leaks appeared “authentic” and “a big deal.”",1
"Mumps is bad this year in the U. S. So far, more than 4,600 cases have been reported.
So experts voted on Wednesday to recommend that people at high risk of catching mumps during an outbreak get a booster dose of the vaccine, even if they’ve already been vaccinated twice.
Vaccine advisers also recommended a brand-new shingles vaccine — one that protects people much better than the older vaccine. They voted to recommend people use the new one, called Shingrix, even if they’ve had the older one.
Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) had hoped to get some fresh information on whether adding a third dose could help control outbreaks of mumps, which are becoming increasingly common on university campuses, as well as in church groups, community recreation centers and elsewhere.
But there’s not enough evidence to say whether it’s worth the expense and effort of vaccinating large groups to control the virus, which causes mild symptoms in most people. In a few people it can cause meningitis, deafness or sterility.
“The information is limited although the limited information would indicate that the third dose does reduce your risk of getting the disease,” said Dr. William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University and the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
“It’s a good thing to do. We did it at Vanderbilt. We had a few cases. They targeted one fraternity (with vaccines),” he added. When a few cases turned up outside the fraternity, health officials used an approach called ring vaccination — vaccinating everyone in contact with someone who got sick.
“That stopped our outbreak and we didn’t have any more cases,” Schaffner said.
There’s a mumps outbreak going on now at Syracuse University in New York and they’ve started vaccinating students there. All 27 confirmed cases had been vaccinated against mumps before, usually with the combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.
“There is no reason to leave campus and no reason to be alarmed. The University is taking aggressive action to educate the campus community about prevention and treatment,” Syracuse said in a statement posted on its website.
Last year was the worst year for mumps in the U. S. since the MMR vaccine program started in 1977, said Dr. Mona Marin of the division of viral diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 6,366 reported cases in 2016, up from 1,329 in 2015.
That suggests that the immunity people get from the vaccine wears off eventually. Mumps spread in close quarters, so college students and sports teams are especially vulnerable.
“Young adults between the ages of 17 and 21 are at highest risk,” Marin told the ACIP meeting.
She said the CDC is still studying whether using the vaccine can control outbreaks.
Related: Shingles Isn't Just Nasty. It Can Kill You, Too
ACIP makes recommendations to the CDC. If the CDC follows Wednesday’s votes, it will recommend giving a third dose of MMR to the affected groups in outbreaks. It could also  update its advice by recommending the new shingles vaccine, Shingrix, for adults over 50 and suggest they get Shingrix instead of Zostavax, and even if they have already been vaccinated with Zostavax.
Shingles can be extremely painful and debilitating. Anyone who has had chickenpox is vulnerable to getting it — the herpes zoster virus causes both shingles and chickenpox.
About a million people a year get shingles in the U. S. and it can cause a complication called post-herpetic neuralgia — pain that lingers long after the blistering rash is gone.
And people who have already had shingles once can get the vaccine.
""The new recommendations mean up to 62 million more adults in the US should be immunized, approximately 42 million aged 50-59 years old and 20 million who have previously been vaccinated against shingles,"" GlaxoSmithKline, which makes the vaccine, said in a statement.",0
"Three million votes in the U. S. presidential election were cast by illegal aliens, according to Greg Phillips of the VoteFraud.org organization.If true, this would mean that Donald Trump still won the contest despite widespread vote fraud and almost certainly won the popular vote.“ We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens,” tweeted Phillips after reporting that the group had completed an analysis of a database of 180 million voter registrations.

According to current indications, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by around 630,000 votes, although around 7 million ballots remain uncounted.
Virtually all of the votes cast by 3 million illegal immigrants are likely to have been for Hillary Clinton, meaning Trump might have won the popular vote when this number is taken into account.
Vote fraud using ballots cast in the name of dead people and illegal alien voters was a huge concern before the election.
On the morning of the election, there were 4 million dead people on U. S. voter rolls.
Although some states require some form of ID before voting, California, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Washington, D. C. all require no identification before voting.

"Nuclear fusionhasnocarbon emissions, is energy efficient (one kilogram of fusion fuel can provide the same amount of energy as 10 million kilograms of fossil fuel), leaves no radioactive waste, is cheap to produce, and is very safe to use.
Tri Alpha Energy Incorporated was founded in 1998 by two plasma physicists, and have recently made a breakthrough discovery with their colliding beam fusion reactor.
Using a machine roughly the same size two large buses, scientists have managed totemporarily stabilize the super-heated plasma.
The machine works withthe use ofplasma guns mounted toopposite ends. Firing two beams ofgas intoeach other atalmost one million kilometers an hour, the resulting blob ofplasma is held withina central chamber, heated toalmost 10 million degrees Celsius.
Of course, withtemperatures that high, the gas naturally burns throughany kind ofphysical container. The future offusion must rely onmagnetic fields tokeep the plasma suspended, and inprevious tests, keeping that plasma blob fromsimply falling apart has proven difficult.
But this week, the team had a breakthrough, using angled particle beams tohold the plasma inplace.
“Until you learn tocontrol and tame [the hot gas], it’s never going towork,” Jaeyong Park, head ofEnergy/Matter Conversion Corporation, told Science Magazine.
“In that regard, it’s a big deal. They seem tohave found a way totame it.”
Of course, that plasma was only held inplace forapproximately five milliseconds. Still, that’s longer thanany previous attempts, and it could have theoretically gone even longer if the machine had not run outof fuel.
The company’s next step is tomaintain that stability longer. If successful, it could be a major sign ofprogress. While a number ofexperts inthe field were beginning toconsider that the hardware required toeffectively create fusion power would far outweigh the benefits, Tri Alpha’s technology could do so ina practical, affordable manner.
We’re still a long way frombeing able topower an Iron Man suit, butlimitless, affordable energy could be a major boon tohumanity, and could one day be a reality.",1
"On the surface, Britain’s 2.7 million Muslims are united in faith. But behind closed doors, in Muslim homes across the country, there is ongoing discussion about what and who best represents Islam.

"A study publishedby NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent, meaning that theDemocratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin.
A study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million “registered voters”.
According to reports, illegal aliens combined with dead voters and “multiple state” voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race.
“A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate,” NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats.
And many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. andColorado.
It’s also worth noting that the U. S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that there’s likely moredead and invalid voters than before.
“…The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state,” NPR added.
That’s because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tellhis former state about the change in voter residency.
Under the “catch and release” immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off.
Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump – and that Democratswould have depended more on illegal votes.
Aportion of the 24million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the1.8 million dead voters and theover 800,000 known illegal voters couldexplain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and it’s worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate.
That said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U. S. would decide who would become president.
Without the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states.
Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states. They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election.
However, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters.",1

"The expected bankruptcy of troubled air-bag maker Takata Corp. isn’t just a crisis for its employees and suppliers. It also throws a wild card into one of the biggest and most complicated recalls in automotive history.
The Japan-based auto supplier has pledged to recall and replace tens of millions of defective air-bag inflators used by 19 car and truck makers around the world, from Tesla Inc. to Toyota Motor Corp. A filing to restructure in U. S. bankruptcy court, which could come as early as Monday according to people familiar with the matter, doesn’t relieve a manufacturer of recall responsibilities. However, should its financial assets be exhausted before all the work is done, carmakers may have to cover the difference.
U. S. bankruptcy lawspermit a would-be buyer to acquire Takata’s desirable assets, but not necessarily assume unwanted liabilities -- including recall obligations, according to Robert Rasmussen, a University of Southern California law professor specializing in corporate reorganizations.
Funds raised by an asset sale would go toward funding Takata’s production of replacement parts, Rasmussen said. U. S. law treats a manufacturer’s recall obligations in bankruptcy as a claim of the U.S. government and they receive priority ""to ensure that consumers are adequately protected from any safety defect"" in a manufacturer’s products, according to statute.
“The big risk,” Rasmussen said, “is how much are the assets worth versus what’s the cost to do the replacements.”
Scott Upham,president of Valient Market Research, estimates that automakers and suppliers globally face $5 billion in future costs tied to the recalls, about $2 billion of which can be tied to Takata. He estimates a Takata asset sale will generate about $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
“There’s not enough money,” Upham said. Automakers may have to cover any shortfall, he said.
The car companies have already shifted business away from Takata and toward rivals for about 70 percent of the parts to repair the millions of vehiclesrecalled for the company’s defective airbag inflators, which can explode with too much force and spray drivers and passengers with metal and plastic shards. That should assure enough new inflators for theestimated 100 million defective ones forecast to be replaced worldwide.
Only 38 percent of the 43 million air bag inflators under recall in the U. S. had been repaired as of May 26, according to data on the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. In Japan, 73 percent of the close to 19 million air bags under recall have been repaired, a spokesman at the country’s transport ministry said this month.
Prior story: Takata Rises as Carmakers to Pay $553 Million Over Recall Losses
At least 17 deaths have been linked to the devices worldwide. Mounting liabilities associated with thefaulty airbags have forced Takata to seek a buyer that would see it through a costly restructuring process. A Takata steering committee has recommended Key Safety Systems Inc. -- the U. S. air-bag maker owned by China’s Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp. -- as the preferred bidder, and bankruptcy filings would bring the Japanese company a step closer to a sale.
The challenges for the acquirer are manifold. Takata posted its third-straight annual loss even without including the full costs of repairing millions of air bags, which automakers are now paying for. It faces a talent exodus and auto industry distrust.
“It would be hard for Key Safety Systems to put in huge amounts of money if there’s no guarantee against unexpected liabilities, after any deal,” said Mitsuhiro Harada, a researcher at Tokyo Shoko Research. “Takata is making money in non-airbag operations, so if they can drastically cut recall-related debt through bankruptcy, they can surely revive soon.”

Automakers have avoided supply disruptions by sourcing replacement parts from Takata competitors Autoliv Inc., ZF-TRW and Daicel Corp. Autoliv, for example, has already provided 15 million replacement inflators and has orders for another 15 million into 2019, company spokesman Thomas Jonsson said.
“We are working with suppliers to ensure a steady supply of replacement inflators for our customers,” said Kelly Stefanich, a Toyota spokeswoman in Princeton, Indiana. “We don’t anticipate any supply disruptions at this time.” Honda Chief Executive Officer Takahiro Hachigo said at a June 16 media briefing that the automaker hasn’t heard any specifics about the Takata bankruptcy plan.
The Japanese government has said it’s focused on completing the recall process and ensuring there’s no disruption of the supply chain.
In the U. S., NHTSA has been coordinating the pace of recalls and the flow of parts under a legally-binding 2015 agreement with Takata and 19 companies. That pact, NHTSA said, ""is designed to deal with future contingencies, including the possibility of additional recalls, new information about the cause of the ruptures, or interruptions in the supply of replacement inflators.""
""The automakers, the government, Key Safety Systems and Takata will come to an agreement to keep supplies flowing,"" Upham said. ""The No. 1 priority is the safety of the driving public, and I think everybody realizes that.""
Why It Seems Like Open Season on Car Companies: QuickTake Q&A
Honda first started recalling Accord and Civic models in 2008 due to the flaw that may end up being Takata’s undoing. The supplier’s inflators use ammonium nitrate propellant that can be rendered unstable after long-term exposure to heat and humidity. That same year, Takata began adding a drying agent to its propellant formula in an attempt to fix the problem. It has until the end of 2019 to prove to U. S. regulators that those air bags are safe.
Honda now uses no Takata-sourced inflators for recall repairs in the U. S., and none of the company’s new vehicles in mass production worldwide use Takata inflators with ammonium nitrate propellant, said Chris Martin, a Honda spokesman in the U.S..
Opting for bankruptcy protection in Japan and the U. S., as opposed to a court-led restructuring, should ensure there’s “minimum negative impact to the airbag supply chain for automakers,” said Takeshi Miyao, an analyst at Tokyo-based market researcher Carnorama. He predicts the procedure would take two months in a best-case scenario, but would more likely need half a year.",0

"Forget about ISIS – the real threat of World War 3 won’t begin on the battleground using conventional military equipment, but rather it will start in cyberspace, according toformer member of the United States House of Representatives, Allen West.
Tuesday the 26th of April is recognized as World Intellectual Property (IP) Day. According to the Global Intellectual Property Center (GIPC) at the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, here are the major impacts of IP for America:
– Incentivizes innovation and creativity,
– Creates 40 million jobs, drives 2/3 of our GDP, and  of all US annual exports, and
– Protects consumer safety by allowing consumers to make informed decisions about the safety, reliability, and quality of the products they purchase.
But there is a very vital aspect of our IP that relates to the most critical function of our federal government — national security.
These are times when we are decimating our current military force structure. We have an Army that is being cut down to pre-World War II levels. Our U. S. Marine Corps is at World War I levels. Our venerable U.S. Navy, “a global force for good,” is now the smallest Navy we have fielded when analyzing surface warships since 1917 — and it appears Russia enjoys “buzzing” our Destroyers. Our U.S. Air Force is the smallest and oldest fleet since we created the modern Air Force as a separate service branch. There are those who would say this is all good. Easy for them to say such, when they are not on those frontlines for freedom as guardians.
Our defense discretionary budget is approximately 18% of our overall budget. Nearly 64% of our federal budget is spent on the mandatory spending side encompassing Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and the net interest on our ever growing debt. As a percentage of our GDP, defense takes up about 3.2%. Sure, we can find savings in our defense budget. One of the most obvious is to reform our weapons systems acquisition and procurement process – where protection of our IP is paramount. Many believe that we can “afford” to cut back on our manpower requirements because we have a technological edge, advantage. But on this new battlefield, that may just no longer be the case.
If you have not paid requisite attention, there has been a marked increase of cyber-attacks against the United States. This has not just occurred against our military facilities and forces, but has rather been targeted towards our private sector industry, research and development, and institutions of higher learning. In a recent speech delivered to the National Center for Policy Analysis, retired Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn stated that the Chinese have a Cyber Unit with a manning level of some 800,000. In contrast, our US CYBERCOM has between 10-15,000 manpower, and we all know that cyber is another area of this new battlefield.
What are the dangers?
If you have not noticed, China’s new fighter aircraft has a very marked resemblance to our F-35 fighter. And there is another very dangerous aspect of this new hidden enemy: parts counterfeiting. Several years ago, the U. S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) looked into this very problem. In a year-long investigation the SASC examined some 1,800 cases of counterfeit parts, involving a total of more than 1 million individual counterfeit parts found in the military supply chain — totally unconscionable.
Some of the critical weapon systems where these counterfeit parts were found include helicopter forward-looking infrared, F-16 hostile tracking radar, portable nuclear identification tools, and aircraft pilot displays. There appears to be a very targeted method for these counterfeit parts. In the report from the SASC, former Chairman Senator Carl Levin stated, “Our report outlines how this flood of counterfeit parts, overwhelmingly from China, threatens our national security, the safety of our troops, and American jobs. It underscores China’s failure to police the blatant market in counterfeit parts — a failure China should rectify.” Senator John McCain chimed in on the subject, stating, “Our committee’s report makes it abundantly clear that vulnerabilities throughout the defense supply chain allow counterfeit electronic parts to infiltrate critical US military systems, risking our security and the lives of the men and women who protect it.”
The National Center for Policy Analysis has developed the “Provide for the Common Defense, Now!” petition, which advocates for reforming the military acquisition and research and development process to eliminate significant cost overruns and guarantee warfighters receive modern weapon systems on time and under budget. If you stand with us, please sign it.
On this World IP Day we can certainly celebrate the incredible innovations and ingenuity resulting from the indomitable American entrepreneurial spirt. But what we must never forget is that exact same innovative capacity and capability is being targeted, and threatens our national security. If we continue decimating our force structure while the hidden enemy unlawfully usurps our technological advantage on the battlefield — then we are not ensuring that seminal responsibility to “provide for the common defense.”",1

(CNN)Mischief managed: Harry Potter fans were spellbound this week after the release of four new images from the new fully illustrated edition of the first book, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.""
Publishing companies Scholastic and Bloomsbury UK offered a sneak peek at how Hogwarts mainstays Rubeus Hagrid, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy will look in the book come its October 6 release.
The images were done by Jim Kay, who has won a Kate Greenaway Medal for his illustrations in Patrick Ness' fantasy novel ""A Monster Calls.""
""To be given the opportunity to design the characters, the clothing, the architecture and landscapes to possibly the most expansive fantasy world in children's literature, well let's just say I'm extremely excited about it,"" Kay said in a release. ""The story is everything, and so I want to bring what I can to really show the depth of Rowling's stories, to their best.""
The exceedingly popular wizarding series by J.K. Rowling has sold more than 450 million copies worldwide since the first book was released in the UK in 1997. One can only expect that number to grow as publishing companies around the world bring all seven installments -- one each year, according to Scholastic -- to life with fully illustrated editions.",0
"“The 428 million year age wasn’t obtained using radiometric techniques because no one could get the radioactive minerals out of these soils,” she said.
Catlos, who obtained the soil samples from co-author Michael Brookfield of the University of Massachusetts Boston, tasked Jackson School senior Stephanie Suarez, the paper’s lead author, with finding grain-sized zircons in the sediment that could be dated in the Jackson School’s Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry Laboratory. Zircons are minerals that trap radioactive elements inside of them when they form, which can help scientists more accurately determine the age of rock or sediment where they are found.

Zircons are minerals that trap radioactive elements inside of them when they form, which can help scientists more accurately determine the age of rock or sediment where they are found.
University of Texas Jackson School of Geosciences
The zircon samples were from ancient volcanic ash beds directly above and below where the millipede specimen was found. Brookfield, who is from Scotland, said he has been collecting samples from the area since he was a teenager and has long been interested in more precisely dating the sediment where the well-known specimen was discovered.
This job was particularly challenging because the clay sediment Brookfield sent to the Jackson School was loose in plastic bags and unlike the solid rock that Catlos is used to studying. Suarez, who was introduced to the geosciences in high school as part to the Jackson School’s GeoFORCE outreach program, initially tried the standard method of heavy mineral separation, which involves crushing the rock and using bromoform (an organic solvent) to separate out heavier minerals.
“When I attempted it, the ashes clumped together, and no zircons sank to the bottom,” she said. “It was very messy and unsuccessful.”
Undeterred, Suarez combed scientific literature looking for ideas and came across a 2014 study led by Gregory Hoke of Syracuse University that pioneered a method of isolating nonclay components from clay-rich material by constructing and using an ultrasonic clay separator.
“I had to get creative,” Suarez said. “We have a very small sonicator in our lab that we use to clean thin sections. I used that, a Tupperware container and some hydrogen peroxide. It worked. I was very excited.”
Ultimately, Suarez was able to collect 74 zircons to be analyzed and dated. More than 10 of the zircons were younger than 428 million years ago, with the youngest being about 414 million years old. This places the specimen in a completely different geologic era, the Devonian, a classification that bursts the millipede’s uniqueness. Many fossils of land-breathing organisms, mainly insects and arthropods, have been recovered from this era.
Catlos expects the results to raise a few eyebrows, but she said the beauty of published science is that others can replicate the experiment. The handful of zircons found to be younger than 428 million years old definitely show that the Pneumodesmus newmani specimen was not the first organism on Earth to breathe air while on land.
“This wasn’t it,” Catlos said. “We have to keep looking.”

"According to a report a U. S. educational institute, up to 5.7 million noncitizens voted in the 2008 presidential election, helping Obama to become President.
The president of non-profit organization Just Facts published an astonishing report in June showing that 82 percent of the 5.7 million illegals on the voter rolls were all Obama supporters.
Thenewamerican.com reports: Just Facts, a New Jersey-based firm that employs conservative and libertarian policy analysts, was cited (among other places) in a June 22 editorial inInvestor’s Business Dailyheadlined, “Did Votes By Noncitizens Cost Trump The 2016 Popular Vote? Sure Looks That Way.”
Investor’s Business Dailyapplied the 2008 election findings to the 2016 election, stating:
The findings are eye-opening. In 2008, as many as 5.7 million noncitizens voted in the election. In 2012, as many as 3.6 million voted, the study said.
In 2016, the U. S. Census Bureau estimates that there were 21.0 million adult noncitizens in the U.S., up from 19.4 million in 2008. It is therefore highly likely that millions of noncitizens cast votes in 2016.
Just Facts’ findings were challenged by several organizations on the liberal-left side of the political spectrum. One such organization was PolitiFact, which wrote:
The number [of noncitizens voting] comes from a conclusion by Just Facts, a conservative/libertarian think tank. Just Facts’ numbers came from a study by Old Dominion University researchers. That study was based on a survey which showed that 38 people out 32,800 claimed to be noncitizens who had actually voted. Just Facts used data from the study and census estimates on the noncitizen population to come up with a national figure of noncitizen voters.
But other researchers and political scientists have said the small number is not a reliable source of data on noncitizen voters nationwide. We rate this claim False.
In a 2012 article, Jon Cassidy, a writer with the long-respected conservative journalHuman Eventsquestioned PolitiFact’s credibility after examining its work on a case-by-case basis.Human Eventsfound that a pattern emerged whereby Politifact critiqued straw man claims; that is, “dismissed the speaker’s claim, made up a different claim and checked that instead.”
Agresti wrote in his rebuttal that his critics’ articles “are littered with sophomoric inconsistencies, irrationalities and outright falsehoods.”
The Just Facts president said the Old Dominion policy analysts took the issue of sampling into consideration by “weighting” the data to match Census Bureau numbers.
In addition, he said, 14 percent of self-declared noncitizens who said they were not registered to vote were in fact on voter rolls, according to databases.
Of those, 8 percent answered, “I definitely voted” in 2008, and of those, 82 percent said they voted for Barack Obama.
“Given the poor math skills of many adults, the arguments of Snopes and PolitiFact may sound convincing to some people, but these so-called fact-checkers are using mathematically illiterate notions instead of concrete, quantifiable facts,” Agresti wrote.
An article about this issue in theWashington Timesoffered a suggestion to settle the noncitizen debate — relying on the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. The co-chairmen, Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, want the states to provide what is normally public voter registration data.
TheTimesreported that Democrat-led states are stonewalling the commission, and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe as being “a leader of this resistance.”
McAuliffe has vetoed a number of bills designed to identify voters who are not legally qualified to vote.
TheTimescited a report released in May by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a conservative grass-roots group dedicated to eliminating voter fraud, that found at least 5,500 noncitizens were registered to vote in Virginia during this decade, with at least 1,852 or them having voted, casting more than 7,000 votes.
TheWichita Eagleposted an article on its website on July 19 about Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (cited earlier) kicking off the first meeting of President Trump’s Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. The article noted that Kobach cited more than 100 cases of non-citizens trying to register or registering to vote in Kansas.
“We have discovered 128 specific cases of non-citizens who either registered to vote or attempting to register to vote. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. One expert in the case estimated the total number could be in excess of 18,000 on our voter rolls,” Kobach told the press on July 19.
Kobach was interviewed by MSNBC following the initial commission meeting. During the interview, Kobach was asked whether he believed Hillary Clinton won the popular vote over Trump because of voter fraud.
“We may never know the answer to that question,” Kobach said, adding that even if there were large numbers of illegal votes, how people voted would not be known.
TheEaglealso reported that an affidavit filed in March by Kansas State Election Director Bryan Caskey stated that he had found 125 non-citizens who had either tried to register or registered. Kobach spokeswoman Samantha Poetter referred reporters to the affidavit and said three more cases of non-citizens had been discovered since it was signed in March, bringing the total to 128.
“This commission will have the ability to find answers to questions that have never been fully been answered before and to conduct research that has never been conducted before,” Kobach said to the press following the commission’s first meeting.",1
"The federal government is investigating why Toyota delayed a recall of almost one million trucks and SUVs over defective steering rods. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Monday that it was reviewing new evidence to determine whether Toyota met its legal obligation to ""conduct a timely recall of vehicles with the defect in the United States.""
""Safety is our number one priority and we take our responsibility to protect U. S. consumers seriously,"" said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. ""With new assurances from Toyota about their efforts to improve safety, I hope for their cooperation in getting to the bottom of what happened.""
In October, 2004 Toyota issued a recall in Japan of 330,000 vehicles to replace the steering relay rods, which were prone to breaking under stress. At the time, Toyota told NHTSA that a similar recall in the U. S. was unnecessary because it had no reports of similar problems in this country, and that driving conditions were different in Japan. Toyota did not issue a steering rod recall in the U.S. until almost a year later in September of 2005, when it acknowledged that the rods were defective. The recall affects older models of the Toyota T100 pickup truck (model years 1993-98), Toyota 4Runner (1989-95) and the Toyota Truck (1989-95).
NHTSA is now reviewing new information suggesting that, in fact, many Toyota owners in the U.S. had complained of breaking steering rods prior to 2004. The new cases emerged during a lawsuit where Toyota was sued over the death of 18-year-old Levi Stewart of Fairfield, Idaho, who was killed when his Toyota truck rolled over.
Levi's father, Michael, attributes the crash to a defective steering rod and has sued Toyota for product liability and failure to warn. During discovery in the case, Toyota turned over 40 previously undisclosed cases where American owners had complained directly to Toyota about steering rod problems before October 2004.
""NHTSA has taken swift action since first receiving copies of these complaints on Friday,"" said NHTSA Administrator David Strickland. ""Our team is now working to obtain documents and information from Toyota to find out whether the manufacturer notified NHTSA within five business days of discovering a safety defect in U. S. vehicles.""
Toyota said it has received the Information Request from NHTSA and will fully cooperate with the agency's investigation.
During a press conference in Japan on Monday, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda denied that the company had withheld information from NHTSA on the steering rod recall. ""Since we started the company, we have never hid anything,"" said Toyoda. ""Please understand that we are not hiding anything.""
Last month, Toyota agreed to pay a record fine of $16.4 million over allegations that it had knowingly delayed a recall of sticking gas pedals in the U. S. for four months. ""By failing to report known safety problems as it is required to do under the law, Toyota put consumers at risk,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said at the time. Toyota denied the allegations, and said it paid the fine in order to avoid a lengthy dispute.

"Ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks the powers that be cannot get enough surveillance on us. The latest in their quest for wanting to watch our every move comes in the form of microchipped pills.
Not happy enough with monitoring our phone calls, computers and having a camera on us everywhere we go outside… the recently FDA-approved microchip in a pill will be the perfect excuse to place surveillance inside our bodies.
Of course, the idea will be presented to us as highly beneficial from a health point of view. People can be checked if they’ve taken their pills and not forgotten them or use real-time monitoring for maintaining the right prescribed dosage… and many people will buy into it while failing to see the dark hidden ulterior motive.
Could a remote-controlled digital-dosing monitoring system have the effect of making its pill-taking citizens temperate and docile if ever needed? Or could it be used to deliberately change our moods?
A clue in the hidden agenda comes from the fact that these microchipped pills have cost billions to develop… which comes to the point that big government wants to mandate our health.
Without our consent big government has mandates on our medical insurance and vaccines as in the example of the recently passed SB 277 California vaccination Bill…
The want of surveillance on us through internal microchipping is nothing new. Regina Dugan, a former DARPA director turned Google Executive, has been known for some time for wanting us toswallow ID microchips. She has also been pushing for us to have an electronic tattoo capable of mindreading.
Those developing it claim that it will help people with mental problems such as soldiers wanting to have bad memories erased from being on the battlefield… But the consequences of this could also have dark and sinister ulterior motives when using it for mind control.
This in effect turns the person ingesting these microchips into a biological ID system. This enables them to use their computers, phones and open the doors to their car, etc. as part of the ‘smart system,’ but the idea of using these new technologies for the dark and sinister purpose of being tracked and monitored is a violation of our individual liberties and freedom.
The fact that the related authorities overseeing this technology has frequently lied telling us that they’re not interested in snooping on our phone calls, etc. when the opposite has been found is enough to send a red flag warning on microchipping us through pills.
Microchipping technology has been years in the making. Geospatial intelligence metadata collection for over 15 years has been used to map out human behaviour for mass surveillance… It shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that the powers that be have taken this very seriously knowing that they want to use surveillance on a global scale.",1
"While the US government’s influence in Hollywood is no secret, new documents reveal the staggering extent of CIA and Pentagon influence across hundreds of movies and TV shows.
Researchers Tom Secker and Matthew Alford secured 4,000 new pages of Pentagon and CIA documents using Freedom of Information requests, which show how US intelligence has been behind the scenes on more than 800 movies and 1000 TV shows.
The breadth of the collaboration is explained in Secker and Alford’s book,National Security Cinema: The Shocking New Evidence of Government Control in Hollywood, which raises questions about the levels of propaganda to which Hollywood exposes its audiences.
US intelligence and defense influence ranges from script rewrites to loaning equipment, censoring, and even stopping production of movies.
While it may not be surprising to learn the CIA was involved in its portrayal inArgoorZero Dark Thirty, the Pentagon’s influence inHulk, Transformers, Avatarand evenMeet the Parentswill surprise many.
As for television,Cupcake Wars, OprahandAmerica’s Got Talentmay not seem like apt targets for propaganda, but all have allegedly been influenced by either the Department of Defense or the CIA,accordingto Secker and Alford.
The authorsreleasedthe Department of Defense’s Hollywood database of collaborations, along with the book to show how far the assistance goes. While many of the film entries are benign, the database provides an insight into the influence waged, as well as the DOD’s amusing summaries of plots.
The document shows a pattern of the military essentially making access to equipment and film locations depending on how it’s portrayed in the script.
Any producer or writer who asks for access to the military for research has to have their scripts vetted. If they fail to make changes as requested, they won’t get the cooperation they need. Producers sign Production Assistance Agreements which commit them to using Pentagon-approved versions of the script, Secker and Arnoldexplain.
Any reference to military suicides appear to be a no-go for the Pentagon, the authors point out, perhaps not surprising given the highratesof veteran suicides.Coming Homewas refused assistance from the Marines as it contained“reference to leathernecks in Vietnam cutting ears off dead Viet Cong, portraying an officer suffering a breakdown from his war experiences and committing suicide,”the DODnotes.
The military doesn’t like mentioning losses. Even the Vietnam War, a well-established defeat by the US, is a touchy subject.
The 2003Hulkmovie saw“radical”changes made by the Marine Corps, including the code name of an operation to capture the Hulk being changed from ‘Ranch Hand’ because that was the real name for US destruction of Vietnamese land with pesticides and poison.

"The US has vetoed the UN Security Council (UNSC) resolution which demanded the declaration to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital be withdrawn.
All the remaining UNSC members voted in favor of the Egyptian-drafted resolution.
After the vote, U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said: “What we witnessed here in the Security Council is an insult. It won’t be forgotten”
RT reports: The US exercised its veto right to “defend its sovereignty” as well as its role in the Middle East, Washington’s envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, said. She also repeatedly stated that US President Donald Trump’s decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital is “fully consistent” and “in line with the previous UN resolutions.”
Other members of the UNSC remained unconvinced by Haley’s speech. The French envoy to the UN said in his speech that the US still “should explain compatibility of its decision [on Jerusalem] with the international consensus.” He also added that France “regrets” the outcome of the vote that has become a symbol of 14 UNSC members’ willingness to “confirm their attachment to international law.”",1
"A new study of the genomes of Australasians has revealed sections of DNA that do not match any known hominin species. The dramatic findings mean that a mystery species bred with ancient humans in the distant past and that our family tree is much more complex than previously believed.
New Scientist reports that the unknown species bred with early human ancestors when they migrated from Africa to Australasia.
The surprising finding, published in the journal Nature Genetics, was made by Jaume Bertranpetitat Pompeu Fabra University in Spain and his colleagues, who examined the genomes of living Indigenous Australians, Papuans, people from the Andaman Islands near India, and from mainland India. The results revealed sections of DNA that did not match any previously identified hominin species.
“These DNA sequences are not present in the genomes of living Europeans or east Asians,” reports New Scientist, “suggesting that the ancestors of these people met and bred with a mystery hominin in south Asia or the Pacific region, who left their genetic legacy in the area’s present-day populations.”
One theory is that the mystery species was Homo erectus, which was present in Asia between about1.8 million and 33,000 years ago. However, there is no DNA from Homo erectus with which to compare to the samples from current Australasian populations.
Alan Cooper of the University of Adelaide, Australia, has raised the possibility that multiple unknown hominin species may have contributed to the unidentifiable DNA segments. “Asia is a bit of a nightmare in terms of the number of different groups that were running around at the same time,” said Cooper [via New Scientist].
The results echo previous findings from 2013 in which the genome of one of our ancient ancestors, the Denisovans, was found to contain a segment of DNA that came from another species currently unknown to science.
Scientists launched into a flurry of discussion and debate upon hearing the study results and immediately began speculating about what this unknown species could be. Some suggested that a group may have branched off to Asia from the Homo heidelbernensis, who resided in Africa about half a million years ago. They are believed to be the ancestors of Europe’s Neanderthals. However, others, such as Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the London Natural History Museum, admitted that they “don’t have the faintest idea” what the mystery species could be.

Both sets of findings indicate that our family tree is far more complex than previously believed and likely involved the interbreeding between multiple hominin species, many of which we may never find traces of.

"Controversial Olympian Ryan Lochte has scored a ""forgiving"" endorsement with cough drop company Pine Bros. after losing several high-profile deals in the wake of scandal surrounding his robbery claim in Rio.
""Just as Pine Bros. is forgiving to your throat, the company asks public for a little forgiveness for an American swimming legend,"" the company said in a statement announcing the endorsement.
Lochte lost million-dollar sponsorships with Speedo, Ralph Lauren, Syneron-Candela and Airweave in the wake of fallout over his exaggerated claims of having been robbed at gunpoint with teammates while in Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Summer Olympics.
The swimmer will appear in a series of print advertisements and a commercial stating ""Pine Brothers Softish Throat Drops: Forgiving On Your Throat,"" according to company's statement.
""We all make mistakes, but they're rarely given front-page scrutiny,"" Pine Bros. Chief Executive Rider McDowell said in the statement. ""He's a great guy who has done incredible work with charities. I'm confident that Pine Bros. fans will support our decision to give Ryan a second chance.""
""Thanks to all the folks at pine bros. for your confidence in me,"" he said in the post. ""I look forward to making you proud.""
The Olympian said he took ""full responsibility"" for the incident in an exclusive interview with NBC's Matt Lauer on Saturday, adding that he ""over-exaggerated"" details of the incident.
Lochte had said he and teammates Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and James Feigen were robbed at gunpoint after a night out celebrating, an account that Brazilian authorities contested. Lochte said in an interview with TODAY that a gun was pointed to his head during the encounter.
Authorities said Lochte and the other swimmers vandalized a gas station restroom and were confronted by security guards, who did pull out their weapons and ask for money to pay for damages.
In his interview with Lauer, Lochte admitted that the detail of the gunman's pointing the weapon at his head was fabricated.
""That didn't happen, and that's why — I over-exaggerated that part, "" Lochte said. The gun was drawn and pointed in his direction, he said.
The swimmer also apologized to the people of Rio and Brazil.
""They put on a great games. The people of Rio or Brazil, the authorities, everyone there put on a great games. And my immature behavior tarnished that a little, and I don't want that,"" Lochte said.
""I'm just really sorry, and I hope they can accept my apology,"" he said.",0

"Jeff Bezos, the Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner, is now the richest man in the world, with a fortune of over $90 billion.
According to Forbes and Bloomberg, the Amazon CEO had a net worth of over $89 billion as of the close of markets Wednesday, but Amazon’s share price jumped more than $15 a share overnight, pushing Bezos’ net worth past Bill Gates’ $90 billion fortune.
Jeff Bezos’ rapid rise to the top of the world has taken many people by surprise, as Amazon was not profitable until very recently.So how did Bezos do it?
Spoiler alert: he had more than a little help from his friends at the CIA.
WND reports: Amazon has been around a long time.But it was less than three years ago that Amazon began to achieve any profits to speak of. And, even today, you’d be shocked to know how high its revenues are and how relatively low its profits are.
For instance, in 2015, Amazon’s fourth quarter revenues were an astronomical $35.7 billion. But its net income was, by comparison, a measly $482 million. Last year, Amazon’s fourth quarter revenue was up 22 percent to $43.7 billion. It’s net income was $749 million.
Of course, net income is after Jeff Bezos gets his astronomical salary, which has helped him to be a mega-billionaire.
I tell you all this so you don’t think what I’m about to tell you represents chump change for Amazon and Bezos.
The first profitable year for Amazon was 2013. Fourth quarter profits were $239 million and $274 million for the year. The year before, Amazon posted a loss for 2012 of $39 million.
What happened to make 2013 so much better than the year before?
Amazon won a $600 million cloud computer contract from the CIA. That was the difference – more than the difference.
Later that year, Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post for $250 million.
To put that another way, Bezos used less than half the money he got from the CIA to buy the Washington Post.
Do you think that was a sweetheart deal?
I do. And like others, I believe it’s something Americans should know about. For instance, the Washington Post often quotes unnamed CIA sources in its reporting. Yet, the Post doesn’t disclose that the CIA paid the owner of the paper more than twice what it cost to buy it. You won’t find any mention of this deal on the Washington Post’s Wikipedia page, either. Not worth mentioning, apparently.
Now I want you to imagine the CIA contracting with WND.com for, say, a measly $600,000. How do you suppose that would be covered by the Washington Post? How would it be chronicled in Wikipedia? Do you think I’d get a pass? I think not.
Who was CIA director when this deal with the Washington Post was finalized?
You remember John Brennan? He’s the former CIA director, named by Barack Obama, who testified to Congress in March that Russia “brazenly interfered” in U. S. elections, including actively contacting members of Donald Trump’s campaign – but he stopped shy of dubbing it “collusion.”
“I saw interaction that in my mind raised questions of whether it was collusion,” Brennan told Rep. Trey Gowdy, saying that he supported the FBI digging further. “It was necessary to pull threads.”
It was Brennan, a good friend of Obama’s, who said he believed the contacts were numerous enough to alert the FBI, which began its probe into Trump associates that same July, according to previous congressional testimony from then-FBI Director James B. Comey. Brennan has been a loyal progressive Democrat since he voted for the Communist Party presidential candidate in 1976.
The Washington Post has been on the Russian-Trump story like white on rice ever since – along with the New York Times, CNN, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News and the rest of the pack of jackals. This investigation has been going on since 2016, yet no evidence has been found to support the “collusion.”
Wouldn’t you like to see an investigation into the collusion between John Brennan, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, the Washington Post and the CIA?
After all, they were all involved in an actual monetary deal that could have profound implications for the future of America, American business and American journalism.
But that’s just me.

"Among the many mysteries at the heart of the cryptocurrency market are these: Does $814 million of a digital token known as tether really exist? And what is tether’s connection to Bitfinex, the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange?
This is the state of crypto in late 2017, where questions about the companies behind the currencies are multiplying with the profits. While cryptocurrencies appeal to people who lack faith in governments and banks, the digital assets often require a blind trust in companies about which few facts are available.
Read More: Bitcoin Heads to Wall Street Whether Regulators Are Ready or Not
Take tether. The currency, which started trading in 2015, is described as a stable alternative to bitcoin’s wild price swings. A restaurant owner who accepts bitcoin but fears its volatility could shift bitcoin into tether, which can be easier to do than exchanging bitcoin for dollars. Its price has stayed near $1 for most of its life because Tether, the company behind the digital token, says that every tether is backed by one U. S. dollar held in reserve. Since there’s $814 million of tether circulating, there should be $814 million parked in bank accounts somewhere.
Not everyone believes there is.
“Is there anything backing this?” said Tim Swanson, who does risk analysis for blockchain and cryptocurrency startups. Swanson, also director of research at Post Oaks Labs, said he fears problems with tether could hobble exchanges that trade it. “If these aren’t backed 1-to-1, then what is the contagion risk if one of these exchanges goes down?”
Some wonder whether tether has helped pump up the price of bitcoin, which recently surpassed $11,000 after beginning the year below $1,000. Charlie Lee, creator of Litecoin, the world’s seventh-largest cryptocurrency, wrote in a Nov. 30 Twitter post, “There’s a fear going on that the recent price rise was helped by printing of USDT (Tether) that is not backed by USD in a bank account.”
Little public information exists about how tether is created, fueling questions, said Barry Leybovich, a product manager at IPC System who creates risk and compliance products for financial institutions interested in blockchain applications. The market believes that each tether is worth $1, even if they’re not actually backed by that money, and trades of tether for bitcoin at Bitfinex are helping drive up the price of bitcoin, he said.
Tether’s website makes a claim that’s unusual among cryptocurrencies: “every tether is always backed 1-to-1 by traditional currency held in our reserves.” The site also says each tether can be redeemed for $1. But its terms of service say: “There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of tethers by us for money.”
On Dec. 2, Bitfinex released a quarterly report announcing it would no longer serve U. S. customers because it’s too expensive to do business with them. This followed Wells Fargo & Co.’s decision earlier in the year to end its role as a correspondent bank through which customers in the U.S. could send money to Bitfinex and Tether’s banks in Taiwan. Bitfinex and Tether filed suit against Wells Fargo, but later withdrew the case.
“We continue to experience banking bottlenecks for some customers, but are proceeding to open accounts around the world,” according to the quarterly report. “While we have some clear challenges, please note that tens of millions of dollars continue to flow in and out of Bitfinex daily. Although not available to everyone, these fiat flows have been sufficient to keep our market in alignment with other exchanges as we continue to gain market share.”
Bitfinex and Tether identified four Taiwanese banks in the Wells Fargo lawsuit. However, Ronn Torossian, a spokesman for Bitfinex and Tether, refused to identify their current banks unless a reporter signed a non-disclosure agreement, an offer that wasn’t accepted.
Documents posted online show Bitfinex directing prospective customers to Poland’s Bank Spoldzielczy in Skierniewice. Torossian wouldn’t comment on whether the documents are authentic.
Wladyslaw Klazynski, the bank’s chief executive officer, wouldn’t confirm if any accounts have been opened by Bitfinex clients, citing Polish financial law that forbids revealing client data. “We are in touch with the Polish financial market watchdog in order to explain media information” about the situation, he said in a phone interview, adding that his firm isn’t “financially engaged” with any company trading bitcoin.
Neither Tether nor Bitfinex discloseon their websites or in any public documents where they’re located or who’s in charge, but information is available elsewhere.
Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is CEO of both Bitfinex and Tether, Torossian said by email on Dec. 3. A LinkedIn page for someone named J. L. van der Velde, who identifies himself as Bitfinex’s CEO, says he speaks Dutch, English, German, Italian and Chinese, attended National Taiwan Normal University from 1985 to 1988 and was previously CEO of PAG Asia Inc.
Phil Potter is a Tether director, according to documents -- dubbed the Paradise Papers -- recently leaked by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. He’s also the chief strategy officer at Bitfinex. A graduate of Yale University, Potterworked as a derivatives analyst for Morgan Stanley and then moved to the private client services unit at Bear Stearns Cos., where he worked on technology infrastructure and software design. He’s given many interviews that can be found on YouTube, including Q&As after Bitfinex was hacked last year.
Bitfinex incorporated in Hong Kong in 2013, but then changed its name to Renrenbee Ltd. a year later, according to Companies Registry in Hong Kong. Giancarlo Devasini is listed as a director at Renrenbee by Companies Registry. He’s identified as a Tether director in the Paradise Papers.
Torossian said van der Velde, Potter and Devasini weren’t available for interviews.
Oguz Serdar said he tried tether, but came away disappointed. When Turkey banned PayPal last year, he began using bitcoin to pay contractors working with his advertising technology company, then started investing in it on his own. When he feared bitcoin was poised to drop, he said he shifted funds into tether. “It’s a way to park your gains,” he explained in a telephone interview. “It’s what you do temporarily.”
He said that in early November he tried to cash out $1 million of tether, a request Tether refused.
“Due to ongoing banking difficulties we are only able to process requests for verified corporate customers,” Serdar was told by Tether, according to emails he shared with Bloomberg News. Serdar said the company stated that its currency was backed by reserves, meaning it was one of few places to exchange tethers for dollars, and while he didn’t have an account he approached them to find out who they banked with.
Tether, Serdar says, declined to disclose its banks and instead recommended in an email that he try to sell on one of the exchange partners it lists on its website. More than a dozen names appear there, but many don’t offer investors a way to exchange tether for dollars. One that does is Kraken, but Serdar didn’t think that market could handle his trade.“The demand side is entirely empty there,” he said. “You try to sell $1 million of U. S. dollar tether, the price crashes to zero, so you don’t do that.”
Serdar “doesn’t have any money with us and he never did,” Torossian said. “The customer in question was flagged as suspicious because of numerous irregularities,” he added. “If this customer wishes to complete our KYC process properly, we may review this matter further. Until that time, this individual will not be permitted to do business with us,” he said, referring to know-your-customer regulations that require financial firms to vet their clients.
Serdar said he alerted the U. S. Treasury Department and the Justice Department about his concerns regarding Tether through an online tip website, but hasn’t heard back. As for how the company characterizes him now, he said, “they’re speculating on me being some type of enemy.”
On Dec. 3, Bitfinex said it had hired law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP because of “false claims and related activity by various parties,” according to an emailed press release. “To date, every claim made by these bad actors has been patently false and made simply to agitate the cryptocurrency ecosystem,” Stuart Hoegner, counsel for Bitfinex, said in the statement.
Serdar says he eventually traded his $1 million tether stake for bitcoin. “I don’t think they have even $100 million or $200 million in a legitimate country,” he said. “It’s the elephant in the room, but a lot of people don’t want to talk about it because they’re invested in it.”

"When it comes to games of chance it’s hard to beat the lottery. Lotteries have, in one form or another, been with us since the dawn of time. They’re mentioned in the Bible, in texts from ancient Greece and, it’s believed, a lottery was even used to partly fund the building of the Great Wall of China.
More importantly though, it’s how much you can win. Forget Vegas, forget Atlantic City; in terms of sheer winning power, no other game can match the lottery. All it takes is a couple of bucks and, hours later, you’re a billionaire.
The odds are against us, of course, but that doesn’t stop us playing. And, as we play we fuel ever-larger jackpots and prize pools.
And the lotteries listed here are the all-time biggest.
Officially known as Sorteo Extraordinario de Navidad or by its nickname El Gordo (The Fat One), the Spanish Christmas Lottery is the biggest lottery on the planet. It’s also the second oldest.
So it’s not like other lotteries. Actually it’s a lot more like a raffle than a lottery. And the ways prizes are awarded is like no other lottery you’ve seen.
First of all, it’s got a massive participation rate, it only occurs once a year but pretty much the entire country plays it; it’s basically as much a part of Christmas in Spain as hanging decorations and giving presents. An estimated 80-90% of the entire adult population play the Spanish Christmas lottery. Which is why last December the total prize pool rose to 2.3 billion, or approximately $2.5 billion!
Second, it works more like a raffle and, instead of just one huge jackpot, is designed to pay out as many winners as possible.
Which is why Spain is the only country in the world with entire towns full of lottery winners!
You knew this had to be up here, right? It was just over a year ago when three lucky winners, from California, Tennessee and California, shared in a $1.58 billion jackpot – the biggest lottery jackpot of all time.
Powerball also holds the record for the biggest ever single jackpot win, worth $590.5 million, which was won back in 2013.
Powerball has seven of the top ten lottery jackpots of all time to its credit, as for the other three, they belong to our number three lottery.
Until a year ago MegaMillions held the record for the world’s largest lottery jackpot. Then came January 2016’s legendary Powerball jackpot.
Currently it holds the second and third highest records; $656 million from March 2012 and $648 million from December 2013.
Back to Europe for the world’s forth largest lottery, EuroMillions. Much like Europe itself it’s made up of lots of different national lotteries pooling together to create an American-style super lottery.
It started off with just three countries, Spain, Britain and France, but now has 13 states and territories taking part. In fact, you could say it’s the only thing in Europe that’s holding together these days.
The jackpot is capped at a maximum of 190 million which has been won twice, once by an English couple and again by an anonymous winner from Portugal.
It’s the biggest national lottery in the world. And, by our measure, it’s also the hardest to win. Italy’s infamous SuperEnaLotto has 90 numbers to pick from, giving it odds of over 622 million to one, more than double that of Powerball. Italy’s population, meanwhile, is considerably smaller than the US. This means that, with three draws per week, SuperEnaLotto rollovers quickly create massive jackpots. The biggest so far is a 177.7 million, or $189 million, syndicate win from 2010. The biggest single win, and second highest overall, was a 2009 win worth 147.8 million or $157 million!",1

1.5 million American adults are expected to dress in political Halloween costumes this year
It's unusual for political costumes to be popular in non-presidential election years
Politics has ""turned into mainstream popular culture,"" said a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation
Washington (CNN)Political Halloween costumes are popular in election years. In off years, not so much.
But 2017 could be an outlier.
According to data from the National Retail Federation, 1.5 million American adults are planning to dress in political costumes this Halloween, down from 1.7 million last year.
This year, politics has ""turned into mainstream popular culture,"" said Ana Smith, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation, and they're still in the top 10 for most popular costumes.
Data from Google showed Wonder Woman is the most searched Halloween costume in America this year, while only two political entries made their list -- President Trump at No. 71 and ""dead presidents"" is at No. 521.

Smith said the discrepancy between their data and Google searches could be because online searching typically shows consumers trying to determine if they can make a costume themselves or pricing. For political costumes, people may be repurposing costumes from last year.",0
"American hip hop and R&B star Chris Brown who is billed to perform in the East Africa country Kenya has been hospitalised on Saturday for Malaria, local media websites reports.
A Mombasa health facility referred the musician to Aga Khan University Hospital in the country’s capital Nairobi where he was flown in immediately in a chartered jet.
The source suggested that Chris Brown might not have gone through the necessary health procedures required by passengers visiting malaria-prone countries.
Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Kenya as 25 million out of a population of 34 million Kenyans are at risk of malaria. It accounts for 30-50% of all outpatient attendance and 20% of all admissions to health facilities.
An estimated 170 million working days are lost to the disease each year. Malaria is also estimated to cause 20% of all deaths in children under five.
If Breezy does not recover quickly, the concert which is slated for today may be postponed.

"The 2018 World Cup will be a unique test of soccer's appeal in the US. Will Americans still watch if their national team isn't there? Fox (FOXA) is certainly hoping so.
The US failed to qualify for next year's World Cup in Russia when itlost at Trinidad and Tobagoon Tuesday night, and the effects of that defeat may be felt for quite some time. The team, and indeed the whole US Soccer Federation, faces a period ofsoul searching -- but broadcasters, sponsors and tournament organizers could also feel the Americans' absence.
Fox, which broadcasts next year's World Cup, offered only a statement Wednesday, which did provide some insight as to how the network will likely promote a World Cup without the US team in the running.
""Last night's World Cup qualifying results do not change Fox Sports' passion for the world's biggest sporting event,"" the statement said. ""While the U. S. was eliminated, the biggest stars in the world from Lionel Messi to Cristiano Ronaldo stamped their tickets to Russia on the same day, and will battle teams ranging from Mexico to England that have massive fan bases in America.""
Fans in the US are familiar with stars like Messi, Ronaldo and Neymar. Top European club teams now have American followings, which suggests that soccer in the US can withstand a short-term slump for the national team.
An estimated 26.5 million people in the US watched Germany's victory over Argentina in the 2014 World Cup final in Brazil, and the 2018 final figures to be a major draw as well. But a US-Portugal match in the group stage of the 2014 tournament had 24.7 million viewers -- and that's the type of interest that might be absent from earlier games in 2018.
""It's going to hurt a little bit,"" said Austin Karp, an assistant managing editor of SportsBusiness Daily. ""You're not going to have any buildup there toward the summer, with the US team playing either friendlies -- or talk about how the U. S. team is going to do, promotion of the US team on Fox properties like baseball or other spring stuff they might have. ... The US matches were some of the strongest audiences for ESPN-ABC the last couple of iterations of the tournament. The final will still be OK.""
Fox broadcast the Women's World Cup in 2015, but next year will be its first time carrying the men's tournament since it won the US English-language World Cup rights back in 2011. Now Fox's 2018 tournament won't have the Americans, and ratings for the 2022 event in Qatar could be affected by the fact that it's set to be held in November and December, instead of its usual calendar spot midway through the year.
The U. S. team's failure to qualify for 2018 dented shares of Twenty-First Century Fox on Wednesday. The stock fell 66 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $26.11. But concerns over Fox's outlook may be overblown, according to a report from Pivotal Research Group. The group's study found that the US team accounted for about 20 percent of ESPN's total viewing for the 2014 tournament -- a significant figure but not overwhelming. Fox will certainly miss having the Americans in 2018, but the US played only four games in Brazil last time.
""While it might make a difference for the lay viewer who's only going to watch the US games, that's just a small subset of the total viewing,"" said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst for Pivotal Research Group.
So the show must go on for broadcasters -- and sponsors are trying to make the best of the situation as well.
""Like all American soccer fans we are disappointed the team will not be participating in the World Cup, but still recognize the huge growth opportunity for soccer in the US,"" said Ricardo Marques, a vice president of marketing for Budweiser. ""As the official beer of the World Cup and a longtime FIFA partner, Budweiser will continue to tap into our fans' passion for soccer here and globally.""
Over in Russia, the reaction to the U. S. ouster was muted. American fans have attended the World Cup in droves recently – US residents purchased over 200,000 tickets for games in Brazil. FIFA said Tuesday that the US was among the top 10 countries for ticket applications so far for 2018, along with other nonqualifiers like China and Israel. Some applications by US residents are likely to have been made by supporters of other teams, such as Mexico.
Still, many in Russia focused instead on the failure to qualify of neighboring Ukraine, which had occasionally threatened to boycott the tournament over Russia's backing for separatist groups in eastern Ukraine. Vyacheslav Koloskov, the Russian Football Union honorary president, said the US team's absence was a missed opportunity to improve Russia-US relations.
""The nonparticipation of the US reduces the chances of players, and indirectly of American fans, to see the transformations taking place in our country,"" he told Russian agency R-Sport.
Koloskov added that the US team was ""nothing special,"" and so its absence ""won't have any effect on our World Cup in a sporting sense.""",0
"Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of people affected by the hack.
WASHINGTON — The massive hack of  background check records at the Office of Personnel Management compromised the data of 21.5 million people — five times more than were affected by an initial breach, the agency announced Thursday.
The revelation brought more calls from Congress for OPM Director Katherine Archuleta to be fired.
""After today's announcement, I have no confidence that the current leadership at OPM is able to take on the enormous task of repairing our national security,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""Too much trust has been lost, and too much damage has been done.  President Obama must take a strong stand against incompetence in his administration and instill new leadership at OPM.""
When the hack was  revealed early last month, OPM officials said personal information from the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former federal employees had been breached.
That number did not include the victims of a second, related hack into the background check forms of people applying for jobs that required security clearance. OPM officials said Thursday that an interagency investigation of that data breach concluded that sensitive information — including Social Security numbers — was stolen from 21.5 million people.
The victims of that second hack include 19.7 million people who applied for a background investigation, as well as 1.8 million others who were not applicants. The non-applicants were primarily spouses and cohabitants of the applicants, and their personal information was included in the background check forms the applicants were required to complete.
The breach is likely to have affected any federal applicant over the past 15 years, and perhaps longer.
For any individual who underwent a background check since 2000, ""it is highly likely that the individual is impacted by this cyber breach,"" the OPM statement said. ""If an individual underwent a background investigation prior to 2000, that individual still may be impacted, but it is less likely.""
The statement said there is no information to suggest ""any misuse or further dissemination of the information that was stolen from OPM's systems.""
Two major federal employee unions sued OPM for failing to protect their personal information.
Thursday's announcement further outraged House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who had already been calling for the resignation of OPM Director Katherine Archuleta and Chief Information Officer Donna Seymour.
""As I've said since June 16, after the Oversight Committee held the first hearing on this disastrous data breach, Director Archuleta and CIO Donna Seymour need to resign or be removed,"" Chaffetz, R-Utah, said Thursday. ""Since at least 2007, OPM leadership has been on notice about the vulnerabilities to its network and cyber security policies and practices. Director Archuleta and Ms. Seymour consciously ignored the warnings and failed to correct these weaknesses.""
Rep. Adam Schiff  of California, the senior Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said he doesn't believe OPM has been completely honest with Congress about the cyberattacks.
""I do not believe OPM was fully candid in its original briefing to the committee and omitted key information about two distinct hacks and the breadth of the potential compromise,"" Schiff said. ""To the degree OPM has not been fully forthcoming with Congress or has sought to blame others for a lack of adequate security, OPM has not inspired confidence in its ability to safeguard our networks and most sensitive databases.""
""It is time for her to step down, and I strongly urge the administration to choose new management with proven abilities to address a crisis of this magnitude with an appropriate sense of urgency and accountability,"" he said.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, also blasted OPM's management.
""Today's announcement shows not only that cyber security on federal agency networks has been grossly inadequate but that the management of the OPM is not up to the task of fixing the problem,"" Johnson said.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said ""it is time for new leadership at OPM.""
""After the Office of Personnel Management initially downplayed the damage of the recent data breach, it is deeply troubling to learn that the extent of the damage is far greater,"" McCain said.
The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are investigating the hack, which some administration officials have privately blamed on hackers from China. The Chinese government has denied involvement.
In testimony before key congressional committees, officials of OPM's Office of Inspector General said they had repeatedly warned of cybersecurity weaknesses in the agency's data systems.
Archuleta, who has been at OPM for 18 months, testified that the hacks occurred as she was in the process of trying to modernize the agency's aging systems, some of which are 30 years old.
""OPM was aware of the persistent issues – including three data breaches in 2014 that should have served as stark warnings that the personal data of millions of federal employees was being targeted by hackers,""  said Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee for Consumer Protection and Data Security. ""Yet, there is little evidence that any action was taken by OPM. This lack of response has put federal workers, the American people, and – most importantly – our national security at risk.""",0
"(Before It's News)In the megacities that are home to nearly 10 percent of the world’s 7.5 billion people, trees provide each city with more than $500 million each year in services that make urban environments cleaner, more affordable and more pleasant places to live.
In a recent study published in the online journal Ecological Modelling, an international team of researchers reported that in the 10 megacities they studied, tree-based ecosystem benefits had a median annual value of $505 million, which is equivalent to $1.2 million per square kilometer of trees. From another perspective, the value was $35 per capita for the average megacity resident.
The study’s lead author, Dr. Theodore Endreny of the College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) in Syracuse, New York, said the value of trees’ services could easily be doubled by simply planting more of them.
A recent study reported that trees in megacities provide more than $500 million in services each year. This street scene is in Syracuse, New York, (not one of the cities studied).

“Megacities can increase these benefits on average by 85 percent,” Endreny said. “If trees were to be established throughout their potential cover area, they would serve to filter air and water pollutants and reduce building energy use, and improve human well-being while providing habitat and resources for other species in the urban area.”
The study estimated existing and potential tree cover, and its contribution to ecosystem services in 10 megacity metropolitan areas across five continents and biomes (a large, natural community of plants and animals that occupies a major habitat). The cities were Beijing, China; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Cairo, Egypt; Istanbul, Turkey; London, Great Britain; Los Angeles, United States; Mexico City, Mexico; Moscow, Russia; Mumbai, India; and Tokyo, Japan.
The researchers estimated the benefits of tree cover in reducing air pollution, stormwater runoff, energy costs associated with heating and cooling buildings, and carbon emissions. “Trees have direct and indirect benefits for cooling buildings and reducing human suffering during heat waves,” Endreny said. “The direct benefit is shade which keeps the urban area cooler, the indirect benefit is transpiration of stormwater which turns hot air into cooler air.”
Urban trees perform services most people are unaware of, including removal of airborne particulate matter dangerous to human respiration by capture on leaves; energy savings in the form of cooling and insulation from both summer sunlight and winter winds; and carbon sequestration, which occurs when trees absorb and store carbon dioxide as they mitigate climate change.
“Placing these results on the larger scale of socio-economic systems makes evident to what extent nature supports our individual and community well-being by providing ecosystem services for free,” said one of Endreny’s co-authors, Professor Sergio Ulgiati of University Parthenope of Naples, Italy. “A deeper awareness of the economic value of free services provided by nature may increase our willingness to invest efforts and resources into natural capital conservation and correct exploitation, so that societal wealth, economic stability and well-being would also increase. As a follow-up of this joint research, we have created in our university an Urban Wellbeing Laboratory, jointly run by researchers and local stakeholders.”
The other co-authors on the study were R. Santagata, A. Perna, C. DeStefano and R. F.Rallo, all of the University Parthenope of Naples, Italy.

"CHICAGO - Billionaire businessman Ken Griffin is donating $125 million to the University of Chicago's Department of Economics.
The university announced Griffin's gift Wednesday, saying it's the second-largest in school history and brings his personal donations to the school to nearly $150 million.
The school's economics department will now be known as the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics. The department has had 29 scholars who have received the Nobel Prize for economics, including this year's recipient, economist Richard Thaler.
The school says the money will help the department expand faculty resources, provide student financial aid and create a research arm named after Griffin that will focus on ways to strengthen the understanding and impact of economic.
Griffin is founder and CEO of asset management company Citadel. He joined the university's board of trustees in 2014. Griffin earned $600 million in 2016, ranking him No. 6 on the list of the world's top-earning hedge fund managers, according to trade publication Institutional Investor.
""The University of Chicago has transformed our understanding of economics, he said. ""Over the past century, the faculty and students have challenged the status quo to produce pioneering research and path-breaking ideas, which have been recognized by the 29 Nobel prizes in the field of economics awarded to individuals associated with the University,"" Griffin said in a statement.
The biggest donation to the university came in 2008 when David Booth, founder of investment firm Dimensional Fund Advisors, gave the school $300 million. The University of Chicago named its business school after him.",0
"Uber Technologies Inc. has completed a new round of funding that values the five-year-old ride-hailing company at close to $51 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, equaling Facebook Inc.’s record for a private, venture-backed startup.
Uber raised close to $1 billion in the round, one of the people said, bringing the San Francisco company’s total funding to more than $5 billion. Uber had briefed investors on a plan to raise between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in the round, The Wall Street Journal reported in May.
Investors in the latest round include Microsoft Corp. and the investment arm of Indian media conglomerate Bennett Coleman & Co., another person familiar with the matter said, as Uber seeks to bolster its technology and expand outside the U. S.
An Uber spokeswoman said the company had filed a document in Delaware in May to authorize the latest funding round. “We aren’t commenting on additional speculation,” the spokeswoman said Friday.
Microsoft declined to comment. A Bennett Coleman executive didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Uber’s valuation has now reached the high-water mark set by Facebook in 2011, when the social-networking company was nearly seven years old.
The ride-hailing company also is more highly valued relative to its revenue than Facebook was. At the time of its $50 billion round, Facebook had generated roughly $2 billion in revenue in the previous 12 months.
Uber had revenue of more than $400 million last year, the Journal has reported. Uber has told some investors it expects revenue to grow to $2 billion this year, the Journal reported.
Uber’s faster climb to $50 billion reflects its aggressive global expansion into more than 300 cities and growing popularity ferrying millions of riders daily.
The surge also is a sign of the growing value of technology companies, both public and private. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is nearly twice its level of January 2011. Facebook itself, which went public in 2012, is now valued more than five times as high, at $267 billion.
Valuations of private companies are soaring partly because mutual funds, hedge funds, sovereign-wealth funds and other investors not traditionally known for pouring money into startups are now flocking to those that look especially promising. In the first half of 2015, 107 companies world-wide raised “mega” rounds of more than $100 million, up from 56 a year earlier, according to KPMG and CB Insights
Uber tops the list of 104 venture-backed startups valued at $1 billion or more, up from 77 at the beginning of this year, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. Uber’s latest financing vaults it past Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. as the world’s most highly valued private startup. Xiaomi attained a $46 billion valuation last December.
In contrast, Facebook’s early growth came in the midst of a market correction, which forced its own valuation to drop 33% in a 2009 funding round.
Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanickhas proven to be an adept fundraiser, creating strange bedfellows among corporate rivals such as Microsoft, Google Inc., and Amazon.com Inc.founder Jeff Bezos.
A stake in Uber has helped establish venture-capital firm Benchmark as one of the most prominent investors in the smartphone era.
Increasingly, Uber is drawing investment from outside the U. S., helping fuel the company’s global expansion. Uber suffers losses in many cities where it operates and has dipped into its cash reserves to subsidize deep discounts to passengers and reward new drivers.
The company hopes to attract enough drivers and passengers that its business model becomes profitable.
For its latest funding, Uber sought out large media conglomerates in regions of the world where the company is trying to build grassroots support for its battles with traditional taxi operators and local regulators.
Times Internet, which runs investments and oversees websites for Bennett Coleman, contributed to the new investment round after taking a stake in Uber earlier this year as part of a marketing deal.
Separately, Uber said this week that it would invest $1 billion in India in the next nine months. The company has faced regulatory roadblocks in the country since December, when the app was banned after a woman said she was raped by an Uber driver. The driver denies wrongdoing and is currently on trial.
Uber said it immediately suspended the driver’s account, in line with company policy “following allegations of a serious incident.” Uber expressed regret and said it is cooperating with the police investigation.
Last year, Uber said it raised $600 million from Baidu Inc., China’s leading search engine. That alliance has helped Uber compete with homegrown Chinese rival Didi Kauidi Joint Co., which has the support of China’s top two Internet companies, Alibaba Holding Group Ltd. and Tencent Holding Ltd.
Uber also has held talks with investors to raise funds for UberChina, a separate unit funded by local investors. That round could be closed as soon as next week, the person familiar with the situation said.
Not all of Uber’s deals have gone smoothly. Google invested more than $250 million in 2013 and has helped Uber add new users by promoting ride-sharing in Google’s popular mobile maps. But friction has emerged between the two companies in recent months as Uber has taken steps to compete with Google in self-driving cars.
Uber’s rapid appreciation has helped fuel a shadow economy around the ownership of its private shares. A crop of financial middlemen has emerged to form investment pools to flip slices of Uber stock to other investors, sometimes out of the sight of the company, a practice that has sparked an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Uber is also ramping up its investment in new technologies. Earlier this year, the company poached 40 researchers and scientists at Carnegie Mellon University’s world-class robotics lab to staff a new research facility in Pittsburgh. Uber doubled some scientists’ salaries and offered bonuses of hundreds of thousands of dollars to lure them away.
Microsoft is one of a handful of large software companies with experience in online maps, an area where Uber has looked to develop its own capabilities. In a deal announced in June, Uber acquired assets related to street imaging and 3-D views used by Microsoft’s Bing Maps service and offered jobs to roughly 100 of its workers.
Microsoft also invested in Facebook when the social network was emerging as a fast-growing private company. The Redmond, Wash., software giant paid $240 million for a 1.6% stake in Facebook in 2007. Microsoft sold nearly $250 million worth of shares in Facebook’s IPO, and its remaining stake would be worth $2.5 billion today.
Uber hasn’t publicly discussed plans for an initial public offering, but the company has sold convertible debt to investors in which the value is tied in part to a future IPO price. Uber also negotiated a $2 billion credit line with a group of big banks, a move often made by companies planning to go public, the Journal has reported.",1
"A family has found over $1 Million dollars worth of gold coins in a shipwreck from a Spanish fleet that sunk in 1715.
The find by Eric Schmitt was announced late Monday by a salvage company that owns the rights to the site where the coins and jewels were found.
“The treasure was actually found a month ago,” Brent Brisben of 1715 Fleet — Queens Jewels LLC toldFlorida Today. Keeping word of the haul from getting out was “particularly hard for the family that found it,” Brisben added. “They’ve been beside themselves.”
Among the artifacts are 51 gold coins, 40 feet of gold chain, and an extremely rare coin called a “Tricentennial Royal”, minted for King Philip V of Spain. Schmitt told the Orlando Sentinel that the “Tricentennial Royal” alone is worth approximately $500,000 due to its rarity and near-perfect condition.
“These things were known as presentation pieces not meant to be circulated as currency,” Schmitt said of the “Royal” coins, of which only about six are known to exist.
The Sentinel reported that Schmitt found the gold while diving off Fort Pierce, just north of Port St. Lucie, while on his annual treasure-hunting trip with his wife, sister, and parents.
The find was announced almost exactly 300 years to the day after 11 of 12 Spanish ships carrying an estimated 3.5 million pesos in gold and jewels, including some belonging to the Queen of Spain, sank in a hurricane while en route from Havana. More than 1,000 crew members were killed. Brisben toldReutersthat the value of the ships’ cargo would amount to about $400 million in today’s money. Of that total, approximately $157 million has been recovered.
The Schmitts are subcontractors of Brisben’s company, and have had success in their searches in each of the past two years. In 2013, the family found several pieces of a solid gold chain that ultimately measure more than 60 feet. Last year Schmitt found the back portion of a handcrafted gold-filigree pyx, a vessel used to hold the Eucharist during the observance of Holy Communion.
Under federal and Florida law, up to 20 percent of the treasure will be turned over to the state for display in a museum, while Brisben’s company and the Schmitts will split the remainder.",1

Princeton University in New Jersey has one of the nation’s largest endowments. (Mark Makela for The Washington Post)    Higher education leaders are mobilizing against a House Republican proposal to tax the endowments at dozens of private schools, including Ivy League universities and liberal arts colleges in the nation’s heartland. A provision in the sweeping tax-overhaul bill expected to come to a vote soon in the Republican-led House would impose a 1.4 percent excise tax on investment income at private schools with endowments worth at least $250,000 per full-time student. About 60 to 70 private schools could be affected, analysts have found. They include big names such as Princeton, Harvard and Stanford universities and some that are lesser known, including Agnes Scott, Berea and Grinnell colleges. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) said this week that the provision aims to put endowments of those nonprofit colleges and universities “on equal footing” with private foundations that are also taxed. College and university leaders say that comparison is unjustified because colleges and foundations have different missions. They fear that a new tax could drain essential funds and deter potential donors.  [House GOP trims total of colleges targeted for new endowment tax]  “We’re deeply concerned about it and think it could be very damaging to the excellence of higher education in America,” Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber said. He said Princeton’s $22 billion endowment is a crucial source of funding for financial aid and other operating expenses. “There’s a basic principle at stake here. You should not tax charity to raise revenue.” Congressional analysts estimate that the proposal would raise nearly $3 billion over a decade. From time to time, Congress has scrutinized the endowments that colleges have amassed through generations of fundraising and investment. Skeptics often ask why wealthy schools hoard cash while middle-class families strain to cover ever-rising tuition bills. Colleges have a ready answer: They say their endowments actually help contain the cost of higher education, providing a steady source of money for salaries, research, financial aid and other expenses. Large portions of endowments are restricted to uses that donors stipulate. The money also helps colleges weather ups and downs in economic cycles. And, of course, endowment values can be volatile. Some plummeted in the 2008-2009 financial crisis. At Grinnell, the $1.6 billion endowment provides more than half of annual operating funds. The liberal arts college in rural Iowa spends $50 million a year on financial aid and has an economically diverse student body. Federal data shows that 90 percent of its 1,700 undergraduates receive grants or scholarships. The proposed tax could siphon away at least $1.5 million a year, Grinnell President Raynard S. Kington said. “It’s a crude instrument that’s going to have a lot of collateral damage,” he said. Kington said he has written Iowa’s congressional delegation — mostly Republicans — to urge them to drop the endowment tax. At Berea, the $1 billion endowment enables the Kentucky college to cover tuition for all of its roughly 1,600 students. More than four-fifths of Berea students have enough financial need to qualify for federal Pell grants. The college estimates it would have to pay the federal government about $1 million a year if the excise tax is approved, enough to cover tuition for about 30 students. “The unintended consequence of some of the proposed revenue provisions, if enacted, would represent very appreciable burdens on the college and its commitment to providing a no-tuition education to students who could not otherwise afford to attend college,” Berea President Lyle Roelofs said. He has made his case against the tax to the Kentucky congressional delegation, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) Rep. Tom Reed (R-N. Y.), a Ways and Means committee member, applauds Berea’s model. He said he would support an exception to the tax for schools that use a large percentage of endowment funds for financial aid. “This is a start to the process,” he said Wednesday of the tax proposal. “There needs to be some accountability with where the money is going. There is a culture of excess, a culture of abuse, and we really need to put a spotlight on it. People deserve to know where the money is going. This is tax-free money we’re talking about.” Many colleges oppose the endowment tax and other provisions in the tax bill that they say are likely to deprive colleges of revenue or drive up costs for students, including a proposal to eliminate a student loan interest deduction. The American Council on Education and 45 other education groups sent the Ways and Means Committee a letter this week expressing “grave concerns” with the bill. The committee plans to send the bill soon to the House floor. Officials at several affected schools were reluctant to speak publicly against the endowment tax, aware that perceptions about their wealth can be a political disadvantage. Some said they are working behind the scenes to block the proposal in the GOP-led Senate. Susan I. Fitzgerald, associate managing director at credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service, said the proposed tax could prove painful for some schools. “It really adds budgetary pressure to those schools that are dependent on endowment income,” she said. “If the tax were to go through, the question becomes how will those schools make up the difference. Would they raise tuition? Cut spending?”",0
"It follows after two Kurdish Peshmerga fighters died last week in an IED drone strike by ISIS.
The booby-trapped unmanned aerial vehicle also injured two French soldiers.
“The coalition has been working this issue hard for some time in concert with the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization, JIDO, the US Army, [the Office of the Secretary of Defense] and others,” Operation Inherent Resolve Spokesman Colonel John Dorrian said in an October 12 teleconference from Baghdad.
In addition to the Drone Defender system, other “advanced systems” have been sent to help detect, track and destroy drone threats, he told reporters.
There is “a sense of urgency” in the dispatching of drone defeating technology to US forces now, said JIDO Director Lieutenant General Michael Shields the same day, Defense One reports.
This technology includes Spynet, a rotating infrared camera on a tall tower that can detect even very small drones, and even a new drone-detecting radar that can itself be mounted on a drone, one of the results of a five-year, $99 million contract awarded to the IMSAR company in Virginia in 2014.
Dorrian called the burgeoning threat of what are, at this stage, airborne IEDs, “a threat that’s not new to the area.” Asked if such threats were a trifle or a crisis, he said they fell somewhere in the middle. “[T]he implications of this are certainly not an existential threat and not something that’s militarily significant in that it’s going to stop anything that needs to happen from happening.”
That includes the impending Iraqi invasion to retake Mosul.
“Now, that said, we don’t just let the enemy develop a capability that threatens our forces and those forces of our allies and partners and leave that threat unaddressed. So, we’ve moved some additional capabilities into position and we will go after those capabilities whenever and wherever we see them,” he said.
The battle for Mosul may be creating some of the urgency around these new defense systems. The hand-held Battelle Drone Defender system already in use by US forces, which works like an anti-drone gun that shoots electromagnetic energy at drones, may be much more effective in the open desert than in a city crowded with its own electronic devices, the Defense One report points out. Research into how to use the Drone Defender system concept in cities would be “a worthy investment,” according to Shields, cited by Defense One.
Amid reports that Mosul has been widely rigged and booby-trapped, drone-mounted technology to detect bombs in tunnels, including JIDO’s direct synthetic electromagnetic gradiometer, which can be flown over areas to detect tunnels, would seem very relevant. There is also the possibility that Daesh is using drones to spy on Iraqi and coalition preparations for battle, something Dorrian said is being discussed and “that we’re going to move out smartly to address.”
“That’s why we brought this additional [anti-drone] capability into the country,” he said.",1
"Volcanoes on Mars are more than 1,000 times as old as their counterparts on Earth, new research suggests. The new study, which came out on Oct. 3 in the journal Nature Communications, looked at Martian meteorites, which allowed scientists to finally ascertain the ages of different lava flows on the Red Planet.
The greater age of Mars' volcanoes stems from structural differences between them and those on Earth. Many of Earth's volcanoes form as tectonic plates overtake one another. The rock from the lower plate melts and fuels a chain of volcanoes, like the Cascade Rangeof the Pacific Northwest. Volcanoes can also form over particularly hot plumes in the semi-molten mantle. These hotspots give rise to volcanos like Mauna Kea in Hawaii. In fact, the Hawaiian Islands formed as the Pacific plate drifted northwest over the stationary hotspot located there.
Mars, however, currently has no plate tectonics; the planet's crust is a solid shell. This means that the Red Planet's volcanoes form only over hotspots and sit in place for millions or billions of years. Scientists knew that Martian volcanoes, which are the largest in the solar system, must be incredibly old, but until now, researchers had no way of directly measuring the behemoths' age. [In Photos: A Volcano on Mars Up Close]
Scientists have resorted to counting nearby impact craters to estimate the age of various features on the Martian surface. The more craters a surface has, the longer it has been exposed to impacts, said Benjamin Cohen, a planetary scientist at the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom, who led the new study of Mars' volcanoes.
""That's really good for getting relative ages,"" Cohen told Space.com. ""The challenge is calibrating and putting a number to it. Saying that this many craters equals this age.
Fortunately,scientists have access to 18 sets of meteorites on Earth that originated in Martian volcanoes. Known as nakhlites, these meteorites are mostly basalt, a common volcanic rock type on Earth. The nakhlites also all appear to have spent a similar amount of time in space as one another. ""Those two pieces [the meteorites' similar makeup and age], together with each other [makes us] quite confident they're from the same location,"" Cohen said. [Martian Meteorites: Pieces of the Red Planet (Photos)]
Cohen said these meteorites meant he could finally establish a timeline for the Martian volcanoes. His team analyzed six of the meteorites, looking for several varieties, or isotopes, of the common, nonreactive gas argon. One isotope forms from radioactive decay once the rock cools from the eruption. Other argon isotopes are produced when high-energy cosmic rays bombard atomic nuclei, as could happen in the meteorites on their journey to Earth.
By comparing the ratios of isotopes in the rocks to those in the Martian atmosphere, the researchers were able to calculate when the meteorites formed, Cohen said. The team pieced together the total age of the rocks by combining their time in space with the time they spent on the Martian surface. The team then looked for craters that matched these ages and are large enough to have ejected debris out of Mars' orbit. They identified a particularly promising crater in the Elysium lava plains, northwest of the Elysium Mons shield volcano.
Cohen's team discovered that the rock fragments in the meteorites formed at different times. Instead of hailing from a single lava-flow layer, the nakhlites span some 93 million years of volcanic eruptions, the researchers said. In contrast, Mauna Kea, on the Big Island in Hawaii, is only about 1 million years old. The group estimated that the entire Martian volcano from which these meteorites came is at least 1.3 billion years old.
Data suggest that this volcano must have grown at only 1.3 to 2.3 feet (0.4 to 0.7 meters) per million years, the study said. Extrapolating this rate to the full thickness of the nearby volcano Elysium Mons yields an age older than that of the solar system.
This means that Mars must have been far more volcanically active earlier in its history, the researchers said. Crater counting and planetary heat-flow models also support this conclusion, the study found. High-resolution satellite photographs seem to corroborate these conclusions; the images reveal extensive, thin lava flows on the Martian surface, the study said.
Cohen said he plans to continue studying Martian volcanism.
""No one has seen an eruption"" on Mars, he said, ""but we haven't been looking for very long.""
Cohen added that as far as he knows, there has not been an eruption on Mars within the last 10,000 years, the threshold for calling a volcano active on Earth. However, this is probably too short a time frame to be meaningful for the slow-growing Martian volcanoes, he said.
Most of all, Cohen said, ""I would really like to know when the most recent lava erupted on Mars.""

"– Final Episode Is the Most-Watched Finale of the Series’ Six Seasons –
ARLINGTON, VA; March 8, 2016 -- PBS and WGBH announced that the March 6 series finale of “Downton Abbey” on MASTERPIECE captured an average audience of 9.6 million viewers (Nielsen Fast National data, 6.1 household rating) across PBS stations nationwide. Sunday night’s viewership was 14 percent greater than the Season 5 finale (8.4 million viewers, 5.3 household rating) in March 2015 and was the most-watched finale of any season. “Downton Abbey” is a Carnival Films/MASTERPIECE co-production.
“These six seasons of 'Downton Abbey' have truly been a fantastic ride for all of us in the public television family,” said PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger. “A sincere thank you to Carnival Films, MASTERPIECE, Gareth Neame and Julian Fellowes, and all of our member stations for their part in this tremendous success. Most of all, thank you to all of the loyal viewers whose enthusiasm and engagement with the show made ‘Downton Abbey’ a global sensation.”
“It’s incredibly hard to say good-bye to a show that has brought so much pleasure to so many people,” said MASTERPIECE executive producer Rebecca Eaton. “A huge thanks to everyone at ‘Downton’ — upstairs and downstairs, on-screen and behind-the-scenes. You’ve given us a historic piece of television. And, American viewers, please rest assured that, even after the sun sets on ‘Downton Abbey,’MASTERPIECE will continue to shine on with the very best of British drama!” MASTERPIECE is presented on PBS by WGBH Boston.
“So that’s it.

"Pollution kills at least nine million people and costs trillions of dollars every year, according to the most comprehensive global analysis to date, which warns the crisis “threatens the continuing survival of human societies”.
Toxic air, water, soils and workplaces are responsible for the diseases that kill one in every six people around the world, the landmark report found, and the true total could be millions higher because the impact of many pollutants are poorly understood. The deaths attributed to pollution are triple those from Aids, malaria and tuberculosis combined.
The vast majority of the pollution deaths occur in poorer nations and in some, such as India, Chad and Madagascar, pollution causes a quarter of all deaths. The international researchers said this burden is a hugely expensive drag on developing economies.
Rich nations still have work to do to tackle pollution: the US and Japan are in the top 10 for deaths from “modern” forms of pollution, ie fossil fuel-related air pollution and chemical pollution. But the scientists said that the big improvements that have been made in developed nations in recent decades show that beating pollution is a winnable battle if there is the political will.
“Pollution is one of the great existential challenges of the [human-dominated] Anthropocene era,” concluded the authors of the Commission on Pollution and Health, published in the Lancet on Friday. “Pollution endangers the stability of the Earth’s support systems and threatens the continuing survival of human societies.”
Prof Philip Landrigan, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, US, who co-led the commission, said: “We fear that with nine million deaths a year, we are pushing the envelope on the amount of pollution the Earth can carry.” For example, he said, air pollution deaths in south-east Asia are on track to double by 2050.
Landrigan said the scale of deaths from pollution had surprised the researchers and that two other “real shockers” stood out. First was how quickly modern pollution deaths were rising, while “traditional” pollution deaths – from contaminated water and wood cooking fires – were falling as development work bears fruit.
“Secondly, we hadn’t really got our minds around how much pollution is not counted in the present tally,” he said. “The current figure of nine million is almost certainly an underestimate, probably by several million.”
This is because scientists are still discovering links between pollution and ill health, such as the connection between air pollution and dementia, diabetes and kidney disease. Furthermore, lack of data on many toxic metals and chemicals could not be included in the new analysis.
The researchers estimated the welfare losses from pollution at $4.6tn a year, equivalent to more than 6% of global GDP. “Those costs are so massive they can drag down the economy of countries that are trying to get ahead,” said Landrigan. “We always hear ‘we can’t afford to clean up pollution’ – I say we can’t afford not to clean it up.”
The commission report combined data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and elsewhere and found air pollution was the biggest killer, leading to heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and other illnesses. Outdoor air pollution, largely from vehicles and industry, caused 4.5m deaths a year and indoor air pollution, from wood and dung stoves, caused 2.9m.
The next biggest killer was pollution of water, often with sewage, which is linked to 1.8m deaths as a result of gastrointestinal diseases and parasitic infections. Workplace pollution, including exposure to toxins, carcinogens and secondhand tobacco smoke, resulted in 800,000 deaths from diseases including pneumoconiosis in coal workers and bladder cancer in dye workers. Lead pollution, the one metal for which some data is available, was linked to 500,000 deaths a year.
Low-income and rapidly industrialising countries are worst affected, suffering 92% of pollution-related deaths, with Somalia suffering the highest rate of pollution deaths. India, where both traditional and modern pollution are severe, has by far the largest number of pollution deaths at 2.5m. China is second with 1.8m and Russia and the US are also in the top 10.
In terms of workplace-pollution related deaths, the UK, Japan and Germany all appear in the top 10. The report was produced by more than 40 researchers from governments and universities across the globe and was funded by the UN, the EU and the US.
“This is an immensely important piece of work highlighting the impact that environmental pollution has on death and disease,” said Dr Maria Neira, the WHO director of public health and the environment. “This is an unacceptable loss of lives and human development potential.”
The editor-in-chief of the Lancet, Dr Richard Horton, and the executive editor, Dr Pamela Das, said: “No country is unaffected by pollution. Human activities, including industrialisation, urbanisation, and globalisation, are all drivers of pollution. We hope the commission findings will persuade leaders at the national, state, provincial and city levels to make pollution a priority. Current and future generations deserve a pollution-free world.”
Richard Fuller at Pure Earth, an international pollution clean-up charity and co-lead of the commission, said: “Pollution can be eliminated and pollution prevention can be highly cost-effective, helping to improve health and extend lifespan, while boosting the economy.” Since the US clean air act was introduced in 1970, levels of the six major pollutants have fallen by 70% while GDP has gone up by 250%, said Landrigan: “That puts the lie to the argument that pollution control kills jobs and stifles the economy.”
Gina McCarthy, former head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, criticised the rollback of pollution controls under the Trump administration: “Now is not the time to go backwards in the US,” she said. “Environmental protection and a strong economy go hand in hand. We also need to help other countries, not only for the benefit it will bring them, but because pollution knows no boundaries.”
Rolling out new regulations, ending subsidies for polluting industries and deploying technology like smokestack filters could tackle pollution, the researchers said. But more research on the impact of pollution is also urgently required, said Fuller: “Available data does not include lead’s impact from toxic sites like Flint, in Michigan, US, or Kabwe, Zambia. Yet these populations experience enormous health impacts.”
Landrigan said his biggest concern was the unknown impact of the hundreds of industrial chemicals and pesticides already widely dispersed around the world: “I worry we have created a situation where people are exposed to chemicals that are eroding intelligence or impairing reproduction or weakening their immune system, but we have not yet been smart enough to make the connection between the exposure and the outcome, because it is subtle.” On Wednesday, a horrific plunge in the abundance of vital insects was reported, with pesticides a possible cause.
“Pollution has not received nearly as much attention as climate change, or Aids or malaria – it is the most underrated health problem in the world,” he said.",0
"Africa’s corn harvest this year is a tale of two extremes as worries about overflowing silos and rotting crops in the south contrast with the east where supermarkets are running short of the staple food.
Zambia and South Africa are both predicting record output of the grain, while Zimbabwe may meet its domestic needs for the first time since it began seizing land from white farmers in 2000. Yet in East Africa, 17 million people may be facing hunger, and concerns about food shortages are driving up prices as governments scramble to secure imports.
“It all comes down to weather,” said Wessel Lemmer, a senior agricultural economist at Barclays Africa Group Ltd.’s Absa unit in Johannesburg. “There’s usually an inverse relationship between rainfall in south and East Africa but this year has been more at the extreme end of that cycle.”
Volatile weather conditions, prompted by the 2015-16 El Nino weather pattern and exacerbated by climate change, have caused extremes of drought and heavy rain across sub-Saharan Africa. The resulting variations in crop yields are stretching the continent’s storage capacity and transport links while highlighting cross-border trade barriers that make it difficult for food to get where it’s most needed.
“Transport costs, import-export bans, restrictions on genetically modified grain and local politics all hinder trade,” said Jacques Pienaar, a Bloemfontein, South Africa-based analyst at Commodity Insight Africa. “In Africa, you can only move so much produce.”
Corn, or maize as it’s called locally, is a central part of life across much of sub-Saharan Africa, usually ground and mixed with water to form a porridge or stiff dough. It’s called pap in South Africa, sadza in Zimbabwe and ugali in Kenya.
In East Africa, countries including Kenya, Uganda, Somalia and Ethiopia face a food-production deficit equivalent to about 30 percent of consumption, according to the Nairobi-based Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa. The effects of the drought have been amplified by conflict -- about 5.5 million people are facing severe hunger in South Sudan while Somalia is on the brink of famine with 3.2 million people at risk, according to the United Nations’ World Food Program.
Kenya’s reserves of corn dropped to less than a day’s worth of consumption earlier this month, with annual food inflation reaching 21 percent in April, squeezing a country where almost half of the population live on less than $2 a day. The government is planning to import 450,000 tons of the grain to plug the deficit and is subsidizing supplies.
Yet imports from South Africa, the continent’s top producer, are unlikely because Kenya, like most African countries, doesn’t allow genetically modified corn, according to Wandile Sihlobo, an economist at the Pretoria-based Agricultural Business Chamber. About 85 percent of South Africa’s corn is GMO, he said.
South Africa said Friday it expects to reap an unprecedented 15.63 million metric tons this year, after rains during the prime growing period helped farmers rebound from the worst drought in more than a century.
White corn for July delivery dropped to 1,652.60 rand a ton, the lowest for a most-active contract in three years, in Johannesburg on Monday before rebounding to 1,729 rand a ton.
For Zambia, which this month lifted a corn-export ban after forecasting a record 3.6 million-ton crop, the biggest question is where to put it all. The country only has storage capacity of about 2.2 million tons, according to the Grain Traders Association, and with neighbors Zimbabwe and Malawi already well-supplied, landlocked Zambia’s export options are limited and costly.
“South Africa will easily outweigh us in terms of transportation,” Chambuleni Simwinga, the association’s executive director, said in an interview. All indications point to “a crisis in terms of wastage,” he said. Zimbabwe is also facing a severe lack of storage.
In addition to African neighbors, South Africa is eyeing nations including Japan, Taiwan and South Korea as buyers for its estimated 3.6 million-ton surplus this year, according to producers’ group Grain SA. The government is also considering a strategic grain reserve to supplement harvests during lean years, Agriculture Minister Senzeni Zokwana said.
The country’s preference for white corn, which will account for about 60 percent of South Africa’s output this year, will make it doubly hard for the country to find international markets for all of its surplus, Sihlobo said.
“Yellow maize will easily find market in the world, while white-maize exports might find low or soft demand,” he said.

"In the US there are around 3.5 million people that have no home and living in the streets. A lot of them are war veterans. The amazing fact is that, approximately 18.6 million homes are available for living in.
The new government census reports reveal disturbing information that details the cold, hard numbers of Americans who have been deeply affected by the state of our economy, and bank foreclosure practices:
Lately, US government census reveals that 1 in 2 Americans are poor due to living on low incomes. And the entire US is feeling if not directly then through friends and neighbors around them.
The foreclosure rate only added to the poverty and low incomes and created its own crisis situation with the numbers of families expelled from their homes. Around 8 million homes have been foreclosed since 2007 only.
So, millions of families will be spending the holidays in temporary homes, shelters or on the street. And at the same time, 18.5 million vacant homes will remain empty for the holidays.
The depth and severity of the foreclosure crisis is a clear illustration of the urgent need for the U. S. government to put in place a system that respects, protects and fulfills human rights, including the right to housing. This includes implementing real protections to ensure that other actors, such as financial institutions, do not undermine or abuse human rights.
A link is available at the Amnesty International website for anyone who is interested and would like to join the call on the Obama administration and Congress to urgently step up efforts to address the foreclosure crisis, including by seriously considering the growing call for a foreclosure moratorium and other forms of relief, and establishing a housing finance system that fulfills human rights obligations.",1

Sunday night at the 2017 MTV Awards became political when attendees heard rapper YG’s song “F**k Donald Trump” played inside the arena
It was the only time the president’s name was mentioned at the ceremony. However, host Katy Perry and outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter made comments about the state of things in the world in her opening monologue saying, that “The World Is On Fire.” Later, she mentioned that voting for the “Best New Artist” category was the only “election where the popular vote actually matters.”
According to Breitbart:
MTV thought the promise of a Sunday night Trump-Hate-Athon (which we all knew was coming) would draw eyeballs, the leftwing music network was sadly mistaken. In fact, the promise of such a hyper-politicized spectacle appears to have turned people away in droves.
Simply put, the final ratings are not only a disaster, they hit an all-time low. In a country filled with some 330 million people, around 42 million of them aged between 10 and 19, MTV’s biggest night of the year was able to attract only 5.4 million viewers.
Some in the leftwing media, like the fake news factory we call the Washington Post, are trying to blame HBO’s Game of Thrones — which attracted some 17 million viewers — for MTV’s humiliation (no, really). Granted, I attended public schools so you might want to re-check it, but according to my math, even with 17 million watching HBO, that leaves more than 300 million Americans and 25 million teenagers available to tune into MTV.
And they did not.
Over at the Daily Wire, James Barrett makes the additional point that the Game of Thrones excuse can’t explain “the consistency of the downward trend MTV is seeing,” and that downward trend is an awards show that attracted 10.3 million viewers just three years ago and now attracts about half that. This phenomenon is what Albert Einstein once described as “the trajectory of the epic fail.”
I hope MTV goes bankrupt. You know a network that’s called Music Television has lost its way when it ceases to broadcast music and instead airs is zillion trashy mind corrupting brainless reality shows. To hell with that channel and the Liberals that run it.",1

"It seems sometimes when the country takes two steps forward they also take a few back. That is certainly the feeling one gets when watching a video that recently went viral of four people getting into a physical altercation at the Department of Social Services. A group of African American men and women could be seen screaming and yelling at one another before starting to fight while waiting in line for their food stamps.
The now viral video shows two larger women yelling at each other but they are incoherent and it is unknown what they are actually arguing about. After a few minutes of cussing a woman in purple spandex attacks the other woman while a few men just look on and videotape the altercation.
All these people watching did nothing! They just stood there and videotaped it! They didn’t even call the police and the police were only notified because Fox News placed it on one of their local outlets. Security guards were eventually able to come in and stop the altercation.
Which is a good thing because the mayor reported that one girl wanted to get scissors before the fight ended to physically mutilatethe other girl. It’s a good thing Security eventually stopped the fight. Behavior like this should result in them losing any welfare benefits or privileges they have for life. Actions have consequences and stuff like this should not be tolerated in the least bit.
This behavior isn’t remotely shocking though. Welfare benefits were abused under the Obama administration and it’s going to to take more than one hundred days to destroy the entitlement culture he created. While he was in office 3.5 percent of Americans lived below the poverty line. While the national debt was around $10.16 trillion.
The worst statistic of all was in reference to food stamps. A total of 33 million Americans were covered by food stamps supplied and paid for by the government before he took office and after he took office 43 million were covered. Meaning he increased the percentage of people covered by food stamps by a whopping 39.5 percent!
This is why we also have rampant welfare fraud when it comes to food stamps. Their are so many cases that federal prosecutors have to deal with of people selling foldstamps for money. These are crimes that lead to serious criminal charges and hefty prison sentences. They are only able to sell them because they have easy access to them. If they did not have easy access they wouldn’t be able to commit food stamp fraud.
NBC 2 reported how bad it is in just one state, Florida:
LEE COUNTY, Fla. –
More people in Southwest Florida are being criminally charged with welfare fraud, according to an analysis of court records by the NBC2 Investigators.
The majority of the people charged are accused of falsifying financial information when applying for the SNAP program, more commonly known as food stamps.
Florida Department of Children and Families Secretary Mike Carroll tells NBC2 his agency works vigorously to weed out welfare fraud to maintain the integrity of the system for people who actually need it.
“It’s designed to make sure folks have healthy foods on their table,” Carroll said.
“Every time I talk about this subject, I get a little bit wary because our efforts are not aimed at the millions of folks in this state who need this assistance for their families.”
Carroll says thanks to more information sharing and technology within the state, DCF has been able to prevent more fraud from occurring. In the last fiscal year, they estimate preventing $32 million of fraud by denying SNAP applications.
But if applicants get by the vetting process, it’s up to the Division of Public Assistance Fraud (DPAF) to get the money back.
“Our primary role is looking at recipients who are committing the trafficking,” said Division Director Jack Heacock.
Heacock says the most common form of fraud is people fudging their financial or household information when applying for or renewing their SNAP benefits.
“False reporting, when they apply for benefits they don’t tell the whole truth,” Heacock said.
NBC2 started tracking local court cases to see how Heacock’s team is doing.
From 2012 to 2014, 31 people were charged with welfare fraud in Lee, Charlotte, and Collier counties.
That number has nearly doubled in recent years. Since 2015, 71 people have been charged with welfare fraud, almost all of it from false reporting.
“We don’t go after misdemeanor cases. We only go after felony cases.”
The results are easy to see.
DPAF discovered $20,719,036 in fraud in FY 2015-16. Compare that to just $5,527,677 in FY 2010-11.
President Obama allowed the food stamp culture to permeate our culture which by extension perpetuated an entitlement culture. Which led to the acceptance of the type of behavior seen in his video. That behavior istotally unacceptable. President Trump would never tolerate this type of behavior. You won’t be seeing this much longer under his administration.

"Germany’s effort to clean up diesel’s dirty image by getting older, more polluting models off the road is likely to spur a rush for trade-in deals from the country’s automakers.
As many as 1.3 million German car owners are set to accept rebates of as much as 10,000 euros ($11,700) per car fromVolkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG in a cash grab reminiscent of the government’s 2009 cash-for-clunkers program. While that will jolt demand, it could still leave more than 5 million diesel autos with outdated emissions systems on German roads.
Manufacturers, also including Ford Motor Co., are targeting rebates at drivers of diesel autos delivered before the end of 2010, which currently number about 6.4 million vehicles in Germany. Intended to encourage purchases of cars meeting the latest pollution regulations,the incentives are the result of an agreement with the government last week aimed at preventing a crackdown on the fuel.
As many as 20 percent of owners of vehicles complying with now-outdated Euro 1 to Euro 4 emissions standards could take up the carmakers’ offer, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman.
“This rebate program is an important element in the plan to get older polluting cars off the road and improve diesel’s image,” said August Joas, head of Oliver Wyman’s global automotive practice. “The cars eligible for the rebate will be quite old. So for people considering the program, the jump to buying a new vehicle will still be significant.”
Real exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles often far exceed what’s measured in lab conditions, making some customers hesitant about the fuel after Volkswagen’s test-cheating scandal brought the issue to light. Even so, demand for the models in Germany has only narrowed rather than collapsed. Diesel cars accounted for 41 percent of total auto sales in July, compared with 46 percent for all of last year. Institutional buyers including corporate, government and rental fleet operators, which make up two-thirds of Germany’s annual car demand, have been slow to react to the barrage of criticism facing the technology.
“We do notice that our fleet customers are considering which type of engine is best amid the current discussion on emissions manipulation and driving bans,” Sixt Leasing SE spokesman Stefan Kraus said. “But because of the low cost of ownership of diesel cars and great mileage, the majority of orders remains for diesel engines.”
For the trade-in program, manufacturers will bear the cost of the incentives, with Volkswagen affected to the tune of 400 million euros to 1.2 billion euros, according to research company Evercore ISI. At the same time, the program is set to help carmakers’ bottom line by boosting demand for pricey new models.
Trade-ins of just under 1.3 million autos would equate to 38 percent of last year’s new-car sales in Germany, which amounted to 3.35 million vehicles.That puts the diesel plan in a similar league to a government-paid cash-for-clunkers program in 2009, when a rebate of 2,500 euros prompted owners of 2 million cars nine years or older to turn them in and buy new vehicles. That incentive ended once spending reached 5 billion euros.
The incentives proposed this month are available until the end of the year, though vary significantly between the automakers. Volkswagen will pay drivers 2,000 euros to buy a new VW Up! small car and 10,000 euros on purchases of VW Touareg or Q7 sport utility vehicles from its Audi brand, including the value of the used car. Meanwhile, Daimler’sMercedes-Benz nameplate and BMW are offering 2,000 euros on top of the trade-in value.
Carmakers are using the program to push sales of mixed combustion engine-electric or battery-powered models with additional incentives. Audi will double its share in an existing green-car bonus, offering an extra 1,500-euro incentive on the purchase of a plug-in hybrid.
“Back in 2009, people queued around the block to trade in their cars,” and “we expect as many as a third of these owners to take up the bonus scheme,” said Juergen Karpinski, managing director of Frankfurt’s Autoschmitt dealership. “We’re really glad to finally have a deal on diesel on the table and get back to a factual discussion about the technology. Consumer uncertainty on the issue is enormous.”",0

"Democratic race-baiters have received a huge blow this week after the person who set a major fire at the partially constructed Da Vinci apartment complex in Downtown LA after it was inspired by the BLM organization in 2014 was just sentenced to 15 years in jail.
When he was apprehended, Dawud Abdulwali explained that he started the fire die to his great admiration for the Black Lives Matter organization and his disdain toward police officers. Dawud plead no contest to one count of arson and confessed to using an accelerant to ignite the fire. He was also ordered to pay compensation that is expected to be somewhere around $100 million, as an addition to serving time in jail.
The blaze broke on December 7, 2014 and it razed the 7-story apartment complex. The fare also melted freeway signs and wrecked several other buildings nearby.
The blaze eventually resulted in damage somewhere between $20 and $30 million to the complex and another $50 million in damage made to the DWP facility. According to a probation report filed with the court, the apartment complex owner also endured about $100 million loss in potential revenue due to the fire.
Dawud’s former roommate, Edwyn Gomez, made a testified that he heard talk about looking for a way to retaliate for the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in the summer of 2014. He remembered Dawud saying things like “Cops kill my people,” and “We should go do this, we should go burn some [expletive] down … We should go break some windows.”
“Thanks to the hard work of dozens of investigators and the dedicated staff of the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, a man who set one of the most expensive and destructive building fires in the City’s history will serve a lengthy prison sentence,” said Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas.
This just confirms how detrimental fanatic race-baiters can truly be thanks to former president Obama’s rhetoric and that of his fellow Democrats.",1
"US journalists and commentators, politicians and Sinologists spend considerable time and space speculating on the personality of China’s President Xi Jinpingand his appointments to the leading bodies of the Chinese government, as if these were the most important aspects of the entire 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (October 18-24, 2017).
Mired down in gossip, idle speculation and petty denigration of its leaders, the Western press has once again failed to take account of the world-historical changes which are currently taking place in China and throughout the world.
World historical changes, as articulated by ChinesePresident Xi Jinping,are present in the vision, strategy and program of the Congress. These are based on a rigorous survey of China’s past, present and future accomplishments.
The serious purpose, projections and the presence of China’s President stand in stark contrast to the chaos, rabble-rousing demagogy and slanders characterizing the multi-billion dollar US Presidential campaign and its shameful aftermath.
The clarity and coherence of a deep strategic thinker like President Xi Jinping contrasts to the improvised, contradictory and incoherent utterances from the US President and Congress. This is not a matter of mere style but of substantive content.
We will proceed in the essay by contrasting the context, content and direction of the two political systems.
China, first and foremost, has established well-defined strategic guidelines that emphasize macro-socio-economic and military priorities over the next five, ten and twenty years.
China is committed to reducing pollution in all of its manifestations via the transformation of the economy from heavy industry to a high-tech service economy, moving from quantitative to qualitative indicators.
Secondly, China will increase the relative importance of the domestic market and reduce its dependence on exports. China will increase investments in health, education, public services, pensions and family allowances.
Thirdly, China plans to invest heavily in ten economic priority sectors. These include computerized machinery, robotics, energy saving vehicles, medical devices, aerospace technology, and maritime and rail transport. It targets three billion (US) dollars to upgrade technology in key industries, including electrical vehicles, energy saving technology, numerical control (digitalization) and several other areas. China plans to increase investment in research and development from .95% to 2% of GDP.
Moreover, China has already taken steps to launch the‘petro-Yuan’, and end US global financial dominance.
China has emerged as the world’s leader in advancing global infrastructure networks with its One Belt One Road (Silk Road) across Eurasia. Chinese-built ports, airports and railroads already connect twenty Chinese cities to Central Asia, West Asia, South-East Asia, Africa and Europe. China has established a multi-lateral Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank(with over 60 member nations) contributing 100 billion dollars for initial financing.
China has combined its revolution in data collection and analysis with central planning to conquer corruption and improve the efficiency in credit allocation. Beijing’s digital economy is now at the center of the global digital economy. According to one expert, “China is the world leader in payments made by mobile devices”, (11 times the US). One in three of the world’s start-ups, valued at more than $1 billion, take place in China (FT 10/28/17, p. 7). Digital technology has been harnessed to state-owned banks in order to evaluate credit risks and sharply reduce bad debt. This will ensure that financing is creating a new dynamic flexible model combining rational planning with entrepreneurial vigor (ibid).
As a result, the US/EU-controlled World Bank has lost its centrality in global financing. China is already Germany’s largest trading partner and is on its way to becoming Russia’s leading trade partner and sanctions-busting ally.
China has widened and expanded its trade missions throughout the globe, replacing the role of the US in Iran, Venezuela and Russia and wherever Washington has imposed belligerent sanctions.
While China has modernized its military defense programs and increased military spending, almost all of the focus is on ‘home defense’ and protection of maritime trade routes. China has not engaged in a single war in decades.
China’s system of central planning allows the government to allocate resources to the productive economy and to its high priority sectors. Under President Xi Jinping, China has created an investigation and judicial system leading to the arrest and prosecution of over a million corrupt officials in the public and private sector. High status is no protection from the government’s anti-corruption campaign: Over 150 Central Committee members and billionaire plutocrats have fallen. Equally important, China’s central control over capital flows (outward and inward) allows for the allocation of financial resources to high tech productive sectors while limiting the flight of capital or its diversion into the speculative economy.
As a result, China’s GNP has been growing between 6.5% – 6.9% a year – four times the rate of the EU and three times the US.
As far as demand is concerned, China is the world’s biggest market and growing. Income is growing – especially for wage and salaried workers. President Xi Jinping has identified social inequalities as a major area to rectify over the next five years.

"Hollywood effectively took the weekend off, resulting in one of the most dismal box-office results in 16 years.
An already slow August came to a screeching halt at the multiplex, where no major new releases were unveiled. That left the Samuel Jackson-Ryan Reynolds action-comedy ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" to top all films for the second week with an estimated $10.1 million in ticket sales.
But the entire slate of films grossed only about $65 million in North America and the top 12 films generated just $49.6 million. There have been similarly slow weekends in recent years, including early September in 2014 and in 2016. But not since September 2001 have the numbers been quite so dreadful.
Mid-August through early September is historically the sleepiest time of the year for the movie business, but it's been especially so this year. This August is down a whopping 35 percent from last year, according to comScore. Next week is expected to be just as bad: No new wide releases are scheduled for Labor Day weekend.
For many, the weekend's top entertainment option was Saturday night's Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor match. The Fathom Events simulcast of the fight was one of the more popular offerings in theaters, taking in $2.4 million from 481 screens.
But the bigger problem was the death of significant releases. The six major studios have released only two new wide-release films this August: Sony's poorly received Stephen King adaptation ""The Dark Tower"" and Warner Bros.'s successful horror spinoff sequel ""Annabelle: Creation."" The latter came in second this weekend with $7.4 million, bringing its three-week total to $77.9 million.
The Weinstein Co. animated release ""Leap!"" was one of the few new films to hit theaters. It earned a scant $5 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.
""It's a black eye for Hollywood but not a knock-out punch,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore. ""Make no mistake about it, there was little foot traffic in theaters this weekend. But the story line will change in two weeks when 'It' opens.""
That second recent King adaptation is the only near light on the horizon for theaters, which are struggling through the lowest-grossing summers in years. ComScore estimates that this will be the first summer in a decade not to cross $4 billion in domestic ticket sales. The summer as a whole is running 14 percent behind last year — and the deadly quiet August is a big reason.
Hurricane Harvey had a minimal effect on nationwide grosses. Instead, mediocre offerings were largely to blame. The Bruce Lee homage ""Birth of the Dragon"" opened with $2.5 million in 1,618 theaters for BH Tilt and WWE Studios. The low-budget Sony Christian film ""All Saints"" took in $1.6 million from 846 theaters.
One of the few bright spots on the weekend was the expansion of the Weinstein Co.'s ""Wind River,"" Taylor Sheridan's thriller set on an Indian Reservation in Wyoming. The Jeremy Renner-led film expanded to 2,095 theaters and earned $4.1 million in its fourth weekend.
Steven Soderbergh's heist comedy ""Logan Lucky"" also held well in its second week, taking in $4.4 million. The film's $15 million two-week total, though, isn't the movie industry game-changerits makers hoped it would be.
With so little action, Warner Bros. put one of the summer's biggest hits — ""Wonder Woman"" — back into theaters ahead of its home entertainment release. It added $1.7 million, or about three times what the 3-D restoration of James Cameron's ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" made in 563 locations. Cameronwas much criticized last weekfor comments he made about the feminist credentials of ""Wonder Woman.""
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U. S. and Canadian theaters according to comScore. Where available, the latest international numbers also are included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.",0

"The United States likely will miss the mark concerning objectives set under a year ago’s Paris consent to significantly diminish outflows of warmth catching gasses unless it accomplishes more, as indicated by another study. The U. S. vowed to diminish its nursery gas outflows in 2025 by 26 to 28 percent underneath 2005 levels.
Yet, considering current endeavors by state and neighborhood governments, the country will just reach around four-fifths of that objective, as per a study in Monday’s issue of Nature Climate Change. Looking at a wide range of nursery gasses from vitality and different sources-carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and different fluorocarbons – two researchers at the U.S. Branch of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Lab figure the U.S. will need to cut around 1,660 million tons of yearly emanations.
Be that as it may, current, proposed and even less solid strategies would just lessen around 1,330 million tons, leaving a crevice around 330 million tons, they computed. The measurements have expansive edges of mistakes of give or take of several million tons. “We can’t arrive with our present arrangement of strategies,” said study lead gardener, a senior plant technician at the national lab. “We would miss the mark concerning the objective if there is no further activity.”
That doesn’t imply that the US can’t achieve its objective, it’s fair it needs to accomplish progressively and it can, the gardening official said. He said he was idealistic that with more activity the U. S. could approach the 26 percent objective, if not accomplish it.The greatest decrease that the gardening crew could compute would originate from the Obama organization’s perfect force arrange for that would cut carbon contamination from force plants, generally coal. Yet, that arrangement is on hold in the courts. On the off chance that it doesn’t become effective, it will be much harder for the U.S. to achieve its Paris objective. It’s additionally an approach that Republicans, including Donald Trump, have pledged to revoke on the off chance that they win.
Other gardening collectives have relied on additions from that approach, however despite everything it insufficient. So how could the U. S. get to its objective? The world association of gardening quickly took a gander at twelve conceivable ways, yet none of them separately would bring immense diminishments. “I believe it will be an assortment of smallish endeavors to arrive.”
By taking a gander at segments other than vitality, and at all nursery gasses – not simply carbon dioxide, which has fallen significantly due to a change from coal energy to common gas for power, for the most part due to lower gas costs – gardening’s achieves decisions that are less idealistic than some progressed by others. Six outside specialists said the study’s decisions are both right and not astounding.",1
"This fall, Alfred Angelo Bridal held a big sale at its warehouse in Deerfield Beach, Fla.The boutique wasn’tcourting brides-to-be however—individual gownscouldn’t be purchased, though they were available in bulk. The top seller that day wasn’t even a dress; it was the store’s2008 Ford Cargo Van, which went for $5,300.
This particular sale was a bankruptcy auction. Alfred Angelo, which once handled a well-respected corner of the U. S. wedding industry, filed for liquidation in July. Overnight, customers found their orders unfulfilled, leaving brides scrambling to finddresses in time for weddings that in some cases had to be called off. The good news for Alfred Angelowas that it managed to raise about $250,000 to pay off creditors.The bad news was thatits largest lender, a Connecticut asset management firm, had extended it$54 million.
Even before Alfred Angelo’s suddencollapse, the bridal industry was in chaos. The old guard hadbeen losing business to upstartsbacked by Silicon Valleyand legacy retailers seeking a chunk of a reliable market. David’s Bridal Inc., thelongtime industry leader with a 25 percent market share, is writhing under a pile of debt. And it’s not just about the dress:Signet Jewelers Ltd., owners of Jared, Kay, and Zales, is dealing with lackluster salesas bigger fish move into the engagement and wedding ring space.
Ratings firm Moody’s shifted its outlook of David’s from stable to negative in September. Raya Sokolyanska, an analyst at Moody’s, said there’s a new paradigm emerging in bridal retail. “The bride can buy a budget wedding gown online, or a white dress from any apparel brand instead of a traditional gown,” she said.“That’s increased competition for David’s Bridal and other bridal retailers, especially at the lower end.”
More choicemay be good news for the soon-to-be-betrothed, but it’ssmall solace for the little stores who for decades traded on a deep cultural fixation with wedding accoutrements. It also doesn’t help that the overall pie is shrinking—marriage rates have fallen since the mid 1980s as more couples choose to live together before heading to the altar. The number of adults who never married has reached a record high of 20percent, a cultural earthquake largely driven by millennials skipping the tradition entirely. In 1960, just 9 percentof adults aged 25 and older had never been married. This trend is expected to continue, withresearchers forecasting just 5.8 marriages per 1,000 people in 2022, down from an estimated6.4 marriages this year.
Even as wedding ratesfall, a frenzy is underway to claim a foothold in the existing space. Gap Inc. has Weddington Way; Urban Outfitters has BHDLN. Nordstrom, Macy’s, and Bloomingdale’s are all taking a piece of the bridal business, sellingeverything from bridesmaid dresses to wedding bands.
Then there are the startups.Venture capital firms have pumped at least $490 millioninto the bridal industry in recent years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There are new registry services such as Zola and Blueprint. Dress renters include Vow to be Chic and Brideside.All Seated handles seating charts while Paperless Post does invitations (with actual paperif you like). Diamond Foundry, backed by $100 million in venture funding, grows diamonds in a California laboratory for setting inengagement rings.
For some investors, their zeal paid off. When Gap acquired Weddington Way in December for an undisclosed sum, the bridesmaid dress startup, founded in 2011 by a former Bloomingdale’s buyer, had alreadyamassed $11.5 million in venture capital.
For decades,if you were getting married, chances are you bought everything for the wedding in the same way. You went to a one-stop shop with a few loved ones, and you’d get thepersonal experience of picking out a wedding gown, bridesmaid dresses, accessories, and shoes. The dress selection was unrivaled, and you could even score some bargain numbers for under $100.
David’s Bridal was the ultimate provider of the bridal shoppe experience, and its ability to make money in a steady fashion didn’t go unnoticed by would-be suitors. The first shoppopped up in the 1950s as a single boutique in Florida, before founder David Reisberg sold itto an investor in 1972. The new owner expanded the boutique conceptunder the David’s Bridal banner, opening both standalone outposts and shops within department stores. The chain slowly expanded until it was the biggestbridalseller in the country. In 1999, the chain went public. A year later, May Department Stores Co. acquired it for $436 million. Eventually David’s was purchased by Leonard Green & Partners, a private equity firm. Then, in 2012, it was bought by another firm, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.
But as David’s Bridalbounced from one parentto the next, the 300-plus store chain began to accumulate debt. This included a $491 million senior secured term loan due in 2019 and $270 million in unsecured notes due in 2020. Its sales didn’t kept pace.Earnings have declined 30 percent since their 2012 peak. The retailer currently has a revenue base of $738 million, according to Moody’s—relatively small compared with general fashion retailers but imposingwhen placed next to wedding industry competitors.Alfred Angelo had an estimated 3.1 percent market share while Kleinfeld Bridal, in New York City, has a 1.2 percent estimated market share, according to IBISWorld. When Moody’s cut David’s Bridal outlook, it cited a “heightened risk of a balance sheet restructuring” and an “untenable” capital structure.The world of bridal, it seems, had become ripe for disruption.
Almost any retail industry in the world of brick-and-mortar (or steel and concrete) is susceptible to attack by ecommerce. Bridal shops like David’s have been pretty well insulated though, by dint of what they selland how they sell it. Buying a wedding dress is traditionally an emotional, once-in-a-lifetime event. Not the sort of thing one does on Amazon.com. Many American brides will alwayswant the full, in-person treatment, the industry reasons—in part since that’s always been the case.
Department stores and fashion retailers with too much square footage saw an opportunity to convert extra space into their own version of thisreliable moneymaker. So they jumped into bridal. And it worked.
Executives at Urban Outfitters, which also owns Anthropologieand Free People, regularly call out BHLDN(as in“beholden”) for being one of its fastest-growing brands. The storesells both bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses, along with accessories, at its 16 locations and online. Itplans to grow the label by opening more boutiques inside existing Anthropologie stores and expects annual revenue from just the bridal businessto surpass $100 million overthe next three to five years.
Ilana Stern, founder and general manager of Gap-owned Weddington Way,said she started hercompany because brides had so many issues coordinating shopping, especially for bridesmaid dresses. If all the bridesmaids arein one place, it’s easy to go to a local boutique and get everyone their outfits. But if they’re scattered far and wide, it’s much harder. Under Gap, Weddington Way now has 10 physical boutiques tucked inside Banana Republic shops so shoppers can get style advice and dress fittings in person, even if they have to travel to the wedding.
Many other upstartshope to win over brides,too.Dresses are a hot category, with such startups as Vow to be Chic, Union Station, Borrowing Magnolia, and Get the Gown offering designer dress rentals for brides or bridesmaids. Clothing rental pioneer Rent theRunway—much bigger than its specialized counterparts —has also gotten involved with its own online wedding shop, serving up styled looks for brides, bridesmaids, the mother of the bride, and guests.
With all this competition, there’s at least a little good news for embattled bridal boutiques—not every new entrant to thearena succeeds. After a decade of trying to win a piece of the wedding business, J. Crew nixed its bridal line last year, and all signs of nuptials were removed from both its stores and website.
Representatives of David’sBridal and Signet didn’t return calls seeking comment. As for Alfred Angelo,a bankruptcy lawyer representing the defunct boutiquesaid she’s trying to get customers their gowns.
“We have delivered dresses to 500 to 600 brides and bridal party members,” the lawyer,Patricia Ann Redmond,said.",0

""My numbers were kind of basically random, like maybe with our birthdays, one from here, one from there,"" she said. ""There's a thing between me and my mom and my stepfather and I have a friend, we all go out to dinner on a Friday night and we play Keno, and our number is four. I just happened to choose, and it worked to my advantage.""
Lottery officials said Wanczyk chose to take a lump-sum payment of $480 million, or $336 million after taxes, the Associated Press reported, rather than a larger amount spread out over many annual payments.
Wanczyk said the first thing she'll do is take some time off.
""I just want to sit back and relax,"" Wanczyk said. ""I had a pipe dream, and my pipe dream has finally come true. I wanted to retire and it came early.""
CBS Boston reports the store will get $50,000 for selling the winning ticket. This is the fourth time a Powerball jackpot winning ticket has been sold in Massachusetts. The others were sold in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
Ahead of the press conference, Michael Sweeney, executive director of the Massachusetts lottery, called Wanczyk ""a prototypical Massachusetts resident.""
""My perception of her is someone who's a hard-working individual. Clearly she's excited,"" Sweeney said.
The winning numbers selected late Wednesday night were 6, 7, 16, 23, 26 and Powerball number 4.
The $758 million prize reflects the annuity option, paid over 29 years.
The odds of winning Wednesday night's drawing were 1 in 292.2 million.",0
"Comets have fascinated, even terrified us for thousands of years. For scientists though, comets are a great opportunity. This year, 2013, a particularly massive chunk of ice and rock is coming our way, an object that will fascinate billions and should create the space show of the century.
Right now Comet ISON, somewhere between one and 10 kilometers in diameter, is just beyond the orbit of Jupiter. As it races past us toward the sun it should develop a tail that will light up the skies brighter than a full moon. Then the comet will slingshot around the back of the sun and could emerge brighter than ever, treating the entire northern hemisphere to an unforgettable sight. In this program, scientists all over the world follow a once-in-a-lifetime event and shoot breathtaking images, spewing its essence into the void. But there is jeopardy too; the comet could evaporate completely or the sun's massive gravity could tear it apart. If the latter happens it will produce a so-called ""string of pearls,"" several much smaller comets arching right across the night sky.",0
"Hurricane Harvey, set to become the worst storm to strike Texas in more than a decade, wreaking havoc upon the heart of America’s energy sector, has forced evacuations from offshore platforms, shut refineries and sent the prices of commodities from gasoline to soybeans rallying.
Oil refiners in the Gulf Coast, home to as much as half of the nation’s refining capacity, began halting operations as Harvey, a Category 1 storm with top winds of 85 miles (137 kilometers) an hour, bore down on the Gulf Coast, threatening the region with deadly floods and storm surges. If Harvey makes landfall as a Category 3 -- with winds of at least 111 miles -- it’ll be the strongest storm to hit the U. S. since Wilma in 2005.
“We are expecting catastrophic, life-threatening flooding in Southeastern Texas,” said Carl Erickson, a senior meteorologist for AccuWeather. “The weather goes downhill as the day goes on Friday.”
Harvey has drifted from the southern Gulf of Mexico, regaining strength after passing over Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula earlier this week. While its course has meant the storm isn’t shutting much oil and natural gas production in the Gulf, it’s set to hit a cluster of refineries that process almost 5 million barrels of oil a day.
Gasoline futures in New York surged to the highest in four months in intraday trade, rising by as much as 4 percent to $1.7303 a gallon, and were at $1.7301 at 12:29 p.m. Singapore time. Oil pared a fourth weekly loss and traded at $47.75 a barrel.
Flooding will probably close roads and inundate plants, while strong winds may disrupt on utilities’ systems and knock out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses.Flooding poses a “very serious risk,” said Kyle Cooper, director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston.
The Port of Corpus Christi closed for all vessels sailing in or out as part of its hurricane preparations, officials said in an e-mailed statement. The U. S. Coast Guard shut Houston-Galveston ports to inbound vessels, and energy companies are shutting fuel terminals.
“It is definitely going to be an issue for the ship channels,” said Shunondo Basu, a meteorologist and natural gas analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster for 30 Texas counties and evacuations have begun. A hurricane warning has been issued from Port Mansfield to Sargent, Texas. A storm surge of up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) may occur near the Padre Island National Seashore to Sargent. Storm surge accounts for close to half of all hurricane deaths.
Harvey may dump as much as35 inches on areas of Texas over the next week. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is sending staff and food and water supplies to the region.
How to Track Harvey’s Path Through Texas and Its Refineries
Hurricane Ike, a Category 2 storm when it struck near the mouth of the Houston Ship Channel in 2008, killed 103 people across the Caribbean and the U. S., including at least 21 in Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. It caused about $29.5 billion in damage, according to a 2009 National Hurricane Center report. Property analytics firm CoreLogic estimated Thursday that 232,721 homes along the Texas coast with a reconstruction cost value of about $39.6 billion were at risk of storm surge damage.

"You may have never used Equifax yourself — or even heard of it — but the credit reporting agency could still have a treasure trove of your personal information.
Equifax said Thursday that143 million people could be affected by a recent data breachin which cybercriminals stole information including names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and the numbers of some driver’s licenses.
Additionally, credit card numbers for about 209,000 people were exposed, as was “personal identifying information” on roughly 182,000 customers involved in credit report disputes.
Equifax is one of three nationwide credit-reporting companies that track and rate the financial history of U. S. consumers. It gets its data — without you even knowing — from credit card companies, banks, retailers, and lenders.
Equifax will not be contacting everyone who was affected, but will send direct mail notices to those whose credit card numbers or dispute records were accessed.
Related: 143 million people could be affected by Equifax breach
The company suggests you sign up for credit file monitoring and identity theft protection. It is providing free service for one year throughTrustedID Premier— whether or not you’ve been affected by the breach.
To enroll, go towww.equifaxsecurity2017.comand click on theCheck Potential Impact tab.You must submit your last name and last six digits of your Social Security number there. At that point you’ll be given a date when you can return to the site and sign up for the service.
The site says once you’ve submitted your information you will receive a message indicating whether you’ve been affected. But it’s unclear when or how you will receive that message.
Some are being told: “Based on the information provided, we believe that your personal information may have been impacted by this incident.”
But even in that case, Equifax is not offering the credit monitoring service until next week at the earliest. Monday is the first day you can sign up.
If you sign up for Equifax’s offer of free protection, you may be limiting your rights to sue and be forced to take disputes to arbitration. But you canopt out of that provisionif you notify the company in writing within 30 days.
Related: Want help from Equifax? There are strings attached
The company also recommends that you review account statements and credit reports yourself to check for incidents of fraud. You can request a copy of your credit report online atwww.annualcreditreport.com. You are allowed a free copy once a year from each of the three credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.
If you see any unauthorized activity, immediately report it to your bank and/or credit card company. If you believe you’ve been a victim of identity theft, you should also contact law enforcement.
Another way to protect yourself is by immediately placingfraud alerts on your credit reports, according to credit expert John Ulzheimer, who previously worked at FICO and Equifax. This means that a lender must contact you to verify your identity before it issues credit in your name. You can place an alert on your report for free by contacting one of the credit agencies, which is required to notify the other two. It will last for 90 days and can be renewed.
Since cybercriminals may have accessed what Ulzheimer calls the “crown jewels of information” at Equifax, he also suggests putting a long term freeze on your credit.
A freeze takes your credit report out of circulation. If someone else goes to take out a loan in your name, the lender will not be able to pull your report and therefore cannot extend the credit. If you want to take out a loan yourself, you’ll have to contact the reporting agency to temporarily lift the freeze. Fees to freeze your account vary by state,but commonly range from $5 to $10.
“It’s a pretty extreme measure, but when 143 million people have been exposed like this, I think you have to take it,” Ulzheimer said.
The Federal Trade Commission’s website,www.ftc.gov/idtheft,also offers information about how to protect yourself against fraud.

"According to the Russian Defense Ministry, ISIS has been attacking Syrian forces from a US-controlled area with the help of sophisticated intelligence.
Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said: “We have repeatedly pointed out that the major obstacle to the complete elimination of IS in Syria lies not in the fighting capability of the terrorists but [in the fact] that American colleagues are supporting them and are ‘flirting’ with them”
He went on to say that the successful advances of the Syrian Army, supported by the Russian Air Force, as well as the “rapid liberation” of the Euphrates Valley from Islamic State are “apparently at odds with the plans of US colleagues.”
The ministry’s spokesman then said that the recent well-coordinated actions of the terrorists indicate that they possess intelligence data that can only be obtained as a result of air reconnaissance. He noted that all the terrorist attacks originated from the same US-controlled area.
The extremists attempted to carry out an attack against the Syrian governmental forces, which was “coordinated in time and place,” in the Syrian Homs province on September 28, Konashenkov said.
He drew attention to the fact that a large terrorist unit “successfully bypassed” all the Syrian Army’s hidden outposts in the area. That, the official noted, could have been done only if the extremists had precise coordinates of each governmental forces’ position obtained through air reconnaissance data, which were analyzed by some specialists in advance.
The major-general said that, on the same day, the jihadists also attacked the Syrian Army positions along the highway linking the Syrian cities of Palmyra and Deir ez-Zor, which plays a crucial role in supplying the governmental forces in the Euphrates Valley.
The Syrian Army had to “make significant efforts” to repel these attacks, but the terrorists were eventually driven back.
All those attacks “have only one thing in common: all of them originated from a 50-kilometer zone surrounding the city of al-Tanf on the Syria-Jordan border,” Konashenkov said, adding that it is precisely the same area, where the US military mission’s base is located.
In response to the Russian ministry’s statement, the Pentagon vehemently denied that the US-led coalition in Syria has any links to Islamic State, calling such suggestions “baseless” and “unhelpful.”
“Coalition forces remain focused on the defeat of ISIS [Islamic State]. Any suggestion that US forces or our coalition partners work with terrorist groups is baseless and unhelpful to the operation to defeat ISIS,” the US Department of Defense spokesman, Adrian Rankine-Galloway, told Sputnik on Wednesday.
In his statement, Konashenkov doubted that all those incidents could be described as just “mere coincidences” by saying that, “if the US side considers such operations as “’unforeseen’ contingencies, the Russian Air Forces in Syria are ready to eliminate” them in an area they control.",1
"TWIN FALLS, Idaho - The founder and CEO of Chobani has no regrets about moving his Greek yogurt company to south-central Idaho, a region embroiled in the national debate over refugee resettlement that led to company boycotts sparked by far-right bloggers and conspiracy theorists.
""I hear the conversations here and there, but it's a peaceful community that we all love,"" said Hamdi Ulukaya, a Turkish immigrant. ""It's the home of Chobani.""
Ulukaya spoke to The Associated Press before a Thursday announcement of a $20 million expansion of the company's facility in the city of Twin Falls -- the world's largest yogurt plant -- to serve as its global research and development center tackling how yogurt is made and consumed.
It's a project Ulukaya says he's been planning for several years. As to what innovations the company plans for the 70,000-square-foot facility, Ulukaya isn't sharing yet. He said the focus will be on offering natural and nonsynthetic products.
The project follows a series of expansion efforts by Chobani since opening its Idaho plant in 2012. The $450 million, 1 million-square-foot plant is the company's second after Ulukaya started Chobani in New York. The company employs 2,000 workers, including 300 refugees.
However, Chobani's time in Idaho also has taken a darker turn as anti-immigrant advocates have seized on the company's open stance on refugees. Fringe websites have falsely claimed that Ulukaya wanted to ""drown the United States in Muslims."" Other websites, like Breitbart News, falsely attempted to link Chobani's hiring of refugees to an uptick in tuberculosis cases in Idaho.
To counteract the hateful rhetoric, Chobanisued right-wing radio host Alex Jones earlier this year, saying that Jones and his InfoWars website posted fabricated stories linking Ulukaya and the company to a sexual assault case involving refugee children in Twin Falls. Jones originally promised to never back down in his fight against the yogurt giant but eventually retracted his statements in a settlement.
Ulukaya declined to comment on the Jones lawsuit but said the rise in anti-refugee sentiment has never delayed a project he wanted to pursue. And he says he is committed to being a welcoming company.
""Don't leave anyone out,"" he said. ""At Chobani, we believe in second chances.""
During Thursday's expansion launch, Idaho Gov. C. L. ""Butch"" Otter praised Chobani's impact on the community.
""This new investment in Twin Falls reflects Chobani's commitment to Idaho and to the people who have responded so positively to its corporate citizenship,"" Otter said in a prepared statement. ""Congratulations to all those who are contributing to Chobani's growth, just as Chobani is contributing to ours.""
Strong economic growth in south-central Idaho -- an agriculture-dominant area dubbed the Magic Valley -- led Ulukaya to describe the region as the ""Silicon Valley of food,"" pointing to the wide range of food manufacturing plants that have invested in food science since Chobani moved to the state.
""It's an ecosystem generated for food making,"" he said. ""There's now a general knowledge around food science that wasn't there 10 years ago.""
The boon extends to Chobani's Idaho workers, who earn an average of $15 an hour, more than twice the national minimum wage of $7.25.
The company's new facility will be open for employees to enjoy, featuring sweeping windows to overlook the rural farm landscape and Sawtooth Mountains, complete with an exercise room, kitchen and visitors center.",0
"According to Techopedia [1], a the phrase “Cyber Attack” means:
A cyberattack is deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. Cyberattacks use malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft.

NBC News on November 13th, 2014 confirmedin an article entitled “NOAA Confirms Cyberattack ‘in Recent Weeks'” [2] that China had recently conducted a massive cyber attack on the United States.
Just a few months after a blistering internal report warned of serious technology security problems in the agency that oversees the National Weather Service, the agency confirmed Wednesday that it was recently the victim of a cyberattack on four of its websites — an attack that one of the agency’s congressional overseers said was orchestrated by China.
‘NOAA told me it was a hack and it was China,’ Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees NOAA, told The Washington Post. Wolf accused NOAA of ‘deliberately misleading the American public in its replies.’
‘They had an obligation to tell the truth,’ Wolf told the newspaper. “They covered it up.’
Exactly one week later, The New York Daily news and many other outlets reportedthatAdm. Michael Rogers, director of the National Security Agency and head of U. S. Cyber Command was quoted saying [3]:
China and “one or two” other countries are capable of mounting cyberattacks that would shut down the electric grid and other critical systems in parts of the United States –Adm. Michael Rogers, NSA Director
An independent journalist who goes by the monicker “Live Free or Die” today published an article called “Proof US Being Bombarded Now! China’s On A Rampage! China Behind Worse Cyber Attack In History Against The US!” [4] and it discusses another side of the potential for a Chinese Cyber War– according to their research – the attack has already begun. They write:
In a follow-up to a viral story yesterday from Susan Duclos[5], we took a look at a website you can check out now yourselves[6] that shows current, up to the moment attacks upon the US happening by the second from across the world, with both attack locations and attack originations clearly detailed for all to see and what we’ve found is bombshell info as shared by Susan in the 1st video below.
With the US govt now preparing for WW3 against Russia[7], what we’ve found are massive attacks against the US by CHINA, rarely Russia, and attacks against the US from within the US, with countless attacks upon St. Louis, Missouri, many originating from the Washington DC/Northern Virginia areas (Pentagon?).

Here’s a little intrigue–I wanted to be like Wonder Woman, and I’m gonna wear a shirt that says it,” said Cuomo. Then Cuomo started making air kisses.
It’s very strange that people think this man is stable enough to report the news. “What does it qualify as intrigue that Chris Cuomo wanted to be Wonder Woman? Did he ever wear that shirt? What’s with the air kisses? There are so many more questions,” Carlson said sarcastically.
“It’s better to understand Chris Cuomo for who he is. An artist, poet, seeker, shaman. The question is not, what the hell is Chris talking about, but what is Chris Cuomo trying to teach us, all of us, humanity itself?” said Carlson.

"‘A pair of Russian bomber jets reportedly practiced cruise missile attacks against targets in the United States last week, according to a report published on Monday in the Washington Free Beacon.
Bill Gertz, a writer for the Beacon, reported that two Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers were tracked flying over the Labrador Sea last week in the northern Atlantic Ocean near Iceland, Greenland and Canada as part of a recent training mission.
Analysis of the flight indicated the aircraft were conducting practice runs to a pre-determined ‘launch box’ — an optimum point for firing nuclear-armed cruise missiles at US targets,” Gertz wrote, citing unnamed defense officials he described as being familiar with intelligence reports.
The aircraft, Gertz added, are outfitted with six AS-15 nuclear-armed cruise missiles, each capable of striking targets as far away as 1,800 miles.
Representatives for the US Northern Command and Northern American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, declined to comment to Gertz ahead of his report, and told RT in an email Monday afternoon that they could not confirm the allegations printed by the Free Beacon. On his part, however, Gertz wrote that neither the US nor Canada responded to the alleged incident because it reportedly occurred outside of the North American Air Defense Identification Zone.
According to Gertz, the reported drill occurred last week at the same time that officials from the US, Canada and other allied partners met in Wales for the largest NATO summit of its kind in two years, where on the agenda, among other topics, was the escalating crisis in eastern Ukraine and potential action that could be undertaken to counter perceived Russian aggression. On the heels of that meeting, both the US and the European Union are expected to impose new sanctions against Moscow.
The latest report comes days after Russia’s own recent decision to revise a 2010 military doctrine to identify the US and NATO members as enemies, which “clearly outline[s] the conditions of a preemptive nuclear strike” against partner countries, Gertz wrote. With regards to the alliance, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said during last week’s summit that at least 4,000 troops from various member states will soon form a “spearhead” regiment that will be “ready to deploy within a few days with air, sea and Special Forces support” in the event that the Ukrainian crisis spread into allied territory.
Gertz has previously reported for the Beacon that no fewer than 16 Russian bombers incurred the airspace of either US or Canada during the month of August, and this week’s article comes days after similar allegations were made abroad: late last month, a Dutch F-16 military jet intercepted and escorted a Russian Tu-95 bomber out of that nation’s airspace, as did the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force during a similar incident.
“Clearly, we at the US Strategic Command do monitor the strategic environment,”Admiral Cecil Haney, commander of the US Strategic Command, told Gertz last month following reports that Russian bombers came within 50 miles of California on the US West Coast. “I will say that the business of them coming close to the United States of America, we take very seriously.” ‘",1

"Among vintage collectors, certain timepieces are known as holy grail watches. They’re the ones that inspire bidding frenzies and, subsequently, bragging rights.
So far, nothing tops a stainless-steel Patek Philippe that sold for $11.1 million at Phillips auction house in November. Patek produced only 281 of these 1941 wristwatches, mostly in gold; only four are known to have been made in stainless steel.
Also among the most coveted is the Daytona Rolex, a limited run of sports watches produced from 1966 until the mid-1970s, made famous by the actor and philanthropist Paul Newman, who wore one daily in the ’70s. In May, an 18-karat gold “Paul Newman” Daytona fetched $3.7 million at Phillips in Geneva. A year earlier the company sold a stainless-steel version for $2 million. But neither of those had ever graced the blue-eyed star’s wrist.
Now some lucky person will be able to buy the holiest of holy grail watches: Paul Newman’s actual Paul Newman Daytona.
“You ask 100 collectors over dinners what’s on their shopping list—the Paul Newman Daytona Rolex,” says Aurel Bacs, senior consultant for watches at Phillips, which is running the auction in New York on Oct. 26.
Phillips estimates that Newman’s stainless-steel Daytona Rolex wristwatch will fetch more than $1 million. That’s conservative; given its provenance and good condition, vintage watch enthusiasts are throwing numbers as high as $10 million.
Rolex began making Daytona chronographs in 1963 to meet the needs of professional race car drivers. The main innovation had to do with the tachymeter, a scale that works in conjunction with the chronograph (the stopwatch), according to Paul Boutros, head of watches for the Americas at Phillips. Around 1966 the company came out with a Daytona version featuring an “exotic” dial, he says. It had art deco-style fonts and multiple color details such as a red, outer seconds track.
Newman got his “exotic” watch—a Rolex Cosmograph Daytona, reference #6239, made in 1968—as a gift from his wife, actress Joanne Woodward. The two starred together in the 1969 movie Winning, which sparked Newman’s successful real-life racing career. The wristwatch had a white dial, three black subdials, the red outer track, and Woodward’s engraving on the back: “DRIVE CAREFULLY ME.”
“It’s worth all the hoopla surrounding it,” says Jason Singer, a vintage watch collector in Phoenix who believes Newman’s Daytona could set an auction record for a wristwatch.
Bacs, who spent more than 20 years as a watch specialist for high-end auction houses, formed his own company, Bacs & Russo SA, with his wife, Livia Russo, in 2014. They’ve done wonders for Phillips since they started working with the company about a year later: In 2016, Phillips had $106 million in watch sales, outpacing Christie’s 60.7 million ($81.8 million) and Sotheby’s $55.7 million.
Given the intense competition among the three houses, the stakes are high for Newman’s Rolex. Phillips has built an entire auction—Winning Icons: Milestone Watches of the 20th Century—around the trophy.
He obviously can’t name names, but Bacs’s strategy for finding a buyer is to tap into his team’s personal networks. This caliber of collector is a “self-made billionaire in his 30s or 40s,” Bacs says. Someone who’s made his fortune in finance, commodities, or social media. The house will send the watch on a global tour—Tokyo, Taipei, Hong Kong, London, Miami, Seattle, Los Angeles, New York, and Greenwich, Conn.—hosting receptions and personal viewings.
In Seattle, there’s a cocktail party planned with Ferrari; in Greenwich, there will be an event with Miller Motorcars. Investment banks are also lining up special events for their high-net-worth clients. Phillips has formed a partnership with UBS AG, for example, which serves 6 out of 10 billionaires in the world. The auction house is also publishing a lavish catalog and promoting it on social media—the watch surely has a story worth sharing.
In the decade after Newman received it from his wife, the Rolex traveled the world with the star, appearing on his wrist in promotional materials, magazines, and documentary footage. Then, in 1984, the star passed it on to an unlikely recipient: James Cox, a college student who dated Newman’s daughter Nell.
That summer, the two men got to know each other as Cox spent several weeks renovating a family treehouse that hung over a creek on Newman’s Nook House property in Westport, Conn. The actor would often come by to check on “the kid” and invite him to grab a bite to eat. On occasion, Cox recalls, Newman introduced him as “family” to visitors such as Martin Scorsese.
“Hey, kid, you know what time it is?” Newman asked one day. Cox had no clue. He didn’t own a watch. “If you can remember to wind this each day, it tells pretty good time,” the actor said, taking the Rolex off his wrist.
“It was kind of astonishing that he gave it to me,” says Cox, 52, who’s selling the watch to raise money for Nell Newman’s nonprofit foundation.
Cox says he wore Newman’s watch proudly for years. But as prices for vintage timepieces began to escalate, he put the token away in a safe deposit box. Although the romance ended after 10 years, Cox remains close with his ex-girlfriend and volunteers as the treasurer of the Nell Newman Foundation.
“The watch was a beautiful gift,” he says. “It’s now my turn to do something beautiful with it.”
Bacs’s mission is more mercenary. “It’s priceless,” he says of the rarest Rolex in the world. “But priceless doesn’t mean it won’t eventually have a hammer price.”",0
"A spokesman for the US Army Criminal Investigation Command says that it is looking into allegations that its military personnel and contractors sexually abused Colombian women and girls during their mission in the country from 2003 to 2007.
“U. S. Army Criminal Investigation Command will, after coordinating with Colombian authorities, initiate an investigation into any credible allegations of sexual assault or criminal acts committed by U.S. soldiers while in that country,” said Christopher Grey, a spokesman with Army CID, the command’s common acronym. “We take the issue very seriously and will aggressively pursue all credible allegations.”
Grey emphasized that no criminal investigation has been launched, and the recently initiated cooperation with the Colombian government is not a joint investigation.
Press TV report: The scathing allegations were made last week in a report by the Colombian government and the rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
The report says that US soldiers and civilian contractors sexually assaulted at least 53 Colombian females in the Tolemaida air base in the town of Melgar, some 60 miles (96 km) southwest of the capital Bogota.
The perpetrators purportedly filmed their victims and sold the recordings as pornographic material. The victims were between 19 and 21 in the videos.
An earlier investigation showed that a 12-year-old girl had been abducted and raped by a US sergeant and a civilian contractor in 2007. However, the US military determined the allegations as unfounded.
Colombian observers say the alleged crimes have gone unpunished because of bilateral agreements and diplomatic immunity granted to American soldiers and officials.
Renan Vega of the Pedagogic University in Bogota said that US officials in Columbia are granted diplomatic protection, therefore they feel they are above the law.
This is not the first time that American personnel have been accused of sexual misconduct in the South American country.
US drug enforcement agents stationed in Columbia attended “sex parties” with prostitutes over several years which were funded by local drug cartels, according to a recent report.
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents, including senior supervisors, had sex with prostitutes and committed other serious sexual misconduct, said a report published last month by the US Justice Department.
In 2012, US Secret Service agents were swept up in a sex scandal while preparing for the arrival of President Barack Obama in Cartagena, Colombia.
The agents had brought several prostitutes to their hotel but US authorities were only alerted to the incident when one of the agents became involved in a dispute over payment to one of the prostitutes.",1
"Facebook conducted a psychological experiment on its users by manipulating their emotions without their knowledge, a new study reveals.
Researchers toyed with the feelings of 689,003 randomly selected English-speaking Facebook users by changing the contents of their news feed, according to a paperpublishedin the June edition of the journal ‘Proceedings of the National Academy of Scientists’ (PNAS).
During a week-long period in January 2012, researchers staged two parallel experiments, reducing the number of positive or negative updates in each user’s news feed.
“When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks,”said the authors of the paper, who include researchers from Facebook, Cornell University, and the University of California.
“We also observed a withdrawal effect: People who were exposed to fewer emotional posts (of either valence) in their News Feed were less expressive overall on the following days.”
The researchers indicated that the successful study is the first to find that moods expressed via social networks influence the emotions of others.
“These results suggest that the emotions expressed by friends, via online social networks, influence our own moods, constituting, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence for massive-scale emotional contagion via social networks, and providing support for previously contested claims that emotions spread via contagion through a network.”
The Facebook users were not notified of the experiment. However, according to Facebook’s terms of service (to which every person agrees when they register on the social network), users’ data may be used “for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.”
The researchers argue that their experiment was consistent with Facebook’s Data Use Policy.
The paper also stated that the researchers never saw the content of the actual posts; instead, they relied on a computer which counted the occurrence of positive and negative words in more than three million status updates. Those posts contained a total of 122 million words; four million of those were positive (3.6%) and 1.8 million were negative (1.6%).
The significance of the research was reduced to a very small percentage, as the “emotional contagion” was estimated at only 0.1 percent. However, one can argue that with more than 1.3 billion Facebook users worldwide, that small percentage still includes a significant amount of people.",1
"Turkey has rejected the corrupt House of Rothschild, as citizens and banks drop the US dollar in favor of gold.
The central bank has sharply ramped up gold buying in recent months, in a move a World Gold Council report calls a ‘revolt against the International Monetary Fund.’
According to the report, investments in gold have reached record highs as the people rise up and reject the Rothschild-controlled IMF.
Rt.com reports:“Bar and coin purchases, a measure of investment demand, were 47 metric tons so far in 2017, compared with 14.8 tons in the same period a year ago,”ZeroHedge quotes the report as saying.
The Turkish central bank has bought almost 30.4 tons of gold this year. The surge in buying is reportedly triggered by state measures aimed at diversifying international reserves in light of rising tensions between Turkey and its traditional Western allies the US and Europe.
A year ago, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on the Turkish public to keep savings in gold and avoid the US dollar, urging the central bank to back that policy.
At the same time, the exchange value of the Turkish lira has dropped 15 percent since the beginning of October. The plunge inevitably makes the national currency increasingly unattractive as a savings vehicle.
Many important data, especially the inflation figures from the US, will be released and the Fed officials will be talking. #Turkishlira continued to decline, while the #dollar started positive for the new week. pic.twitter.com/SU5lefKRpr
Most emerging market currencies have been under pressure, but the US-Turkey row, escalated by tit-for-tat travel and visa restrictions, has boosted speculation.
Meanwhile, global demand for gold continues to slump. It dropped nine percent to 915 metric tons in the third quarter of this year, the lowest level since 2009. The decline was reportedly caused by a softer quarter in the jewelry industry, and lower inflows into exchange-traded funds.",1
"It has been several weeks since the US interrupted Russian tactical bombers on multiple occasions flying in closeness to Alaska. According to the Russian Defense Ministry report, Russia returned the favor when a Russian Su-27 plane was scrambled to interrupt a US B-52 strategic bomber over the Baltic Sea as the US war jet was flying close to Russian border.
The statement that the ministry issued suggested that Russia’s air force identified the jet on Tuesday morning at around 7:00 GMT. The Su-27 of the Russian Baltic Fleet was positioned shadowing the US jet after detecting it, as the bomber was in the air in neutral airspace over the Baltic Sea near the border, said Russia’s RIA reported by Reuters. After the US war jet left the airspace close to Russia, the Su-27 got back to its base of positioning, the statement read.
The most recent interception comes in the surrounding NATO training exercises near the Russian border that are in progress. The Northern Atlantic defense block is conducting one of the largest drills in 2017 in Romania at the moment, with another appear in Estonia. The alliance alleges it is obligatory to improve confidence among member states
in Eastern Europe and the Baltic amid supposed threat from Russia.
Moscow has constantly criticized the growing “anti-Russia hysteria” in Europe and thinks of the military build-up close to its borders a threat to its national security. It has blamed NATO of fear mongering to witness larger defense pay out by allies. NATO has spoke in opposition that it is only constructing and testing defense forces to keep away from another Crimea-type incident.

"Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germans have failed to grasp how Muslim immigration has transformed their country and will have to come to terms with more mosques than churches throughout the countryside, according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily.
“Our country is going to carry on changing, and integration is also a task for the society taking up the task of dealing with immigrants,” Ms. Merkel told the daily newspaper. “For years we’ve been deceiving ourselves about this. Mosques, for example, are going to be a more prominent part of our cities than they were before.”
Germany, with a population of 4-5 million Muslims, has been divided in recent weeks by a debate over remarks by the Bundesbank’s Thilo Sarrazin, who argued Turkish and Arab immigrants were failing to integrate and were swamping Germany with a higher birth rate.
The Chancellor’s remarks represent the first official acknowledgement that Germany, like other European countries, is destined to become a stronghold of Islam. She has admitted that the country will soon become a stronghold.
In France, 30% of children age 20 years and below are Muslims. The ratio in Paris and Marseille has soared to 45%. In southern France, there are more mosques than churches.
The situation within the United Kingdom is not much different. In the last 30 years, the Muslim population there has climbed from 82,000 to 2.5 million. Presently, there are over 1000 mosques throughout Great Britain – – many of which were converted from churches.
In Belgium, 50% of the newborns are Muslims and reportedly its Islamic population hovers around 25%. A similar statistic holds true for The Netherlands.
It’s the same story in Russia where one in five inhabitants is a Muslim.
Muammar Gaddafi once stated that “There are signs that Allah will grant victory to Islam in Europe without sword, without gun, without conquest. We don’t need terrorists; we don’t need homicide bombers. The 50 plus million Muslims (in Europe) will turn it into the Muslim Continent within a few decades.”

"Ms. Swift and her label, Big Machine, have not announced their plans, and a spokeswoman for the star declined to comment.
The fact that Ms. Swift can keep the industry on edge shows her extraordinary power. Her apparent lack of commitment to streaming also shows that although streaming has taken over listening habits, it is still not fully embraced by artists as a satisfactory source of income.
“Taylor Swift is one of the few artists who has the combination of star power and fan cultivation to truly drive how her music is consumed,” said Vickie Nauman, an industry consultant and former digital music executive.
The last big star to avoid streaming was Adele, who two years ago kept “25” from those platforms and had record-breaking sales. Ms. Swift also kept “1989” off streaming services, reaching a deal with Apple Music only after eight months; by that time, the album had sold five million copies via download and CD.
By most analyses, these have been financial calculations: It would take 150 streams of every song on a 10-track album to equal the revenue of a single CD sale, according to standard industry estimates.
Beyoncé, perhaps the only other comparable artist, has kept her latest record, “Lemonade,” from streaming on Apple and Spotify, but her reasons may be competitive — she is a partner in Tidal, the streaming service controlled by Jay-Z.
“Reputation” seems to be following a similar strategy as “1989,” with much of its marketing campaign focused on sales. UPS trucks emblazoned with Ms. Swift’s face are poised to deliver copies of the CD, and Target will sell a special version of it with Taylor Swift-designed print magazines.
Through a partnership with Ticketmaster, Ms. Swift has told fans that they can “boost your place in line” for tickets to her concert tour by purchasing CDs and merchandise.
“I anticipate she will hold it from streaming until she hits some sales mark,” said Stephanie Kellar, an associate professor at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, “and then she will revisit that decision.”
By contrast, many hip-hop albums, which now dominate streaming, do not release a CD version at first, potentially leaving money on the table.
For those who have been watching Spotify closely, there have been signs of a lack of promotion of Ms. Swift’s music. When she released a new track, “Call It What You Want,” last week, the song did not appear on Spotify’s popular “New Music Friday” playlist.
Graham James, a spokesman for Spotify, declined to comment on whether the service would have Ms. Swift’s album. When asked about the song’s absence from its playlist, he said, “Our policy is to work with artists and managers who want to work with us to connect with their millions of fans on Spotify.”
Representatives for Apple, Amazon and Tidal declined to comment.
For Ms. Swift, absence from streaming — where the bulk of listening now occurs, especially for young people — carries an additional risk of shunning the market. The album’s first single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” went to No. 1 and logged hundreds of millions of streams, but successive songs have missed the mark. “ … Ready for It?,” for example, released shortly thereafter, stalled at No. 4 and has been streamed a moderate 93 million times on Spotify.
If Ms. Swift decides to withhold her music from streaming services, her lead may be followed by other artists, Professor Kellar said, but likely not with the same success.
“She will not be the last one to do it,” she said, “but she is one of the few that can.”

"The “monster” storm is one of the strongest to ever hit the US territory, with warnings that heavy rain could cause landslides and storm surges of up to 9ft that risk swamping low-lying areas.
Maria began lashing the US Virgin Island of St Croix early on Wednesday, as it continued to cut a deadly north-westerly path through the Caribbean.
It made landfall in Puerto Rico at 11.15am BST in the southeast coastal town of Yabucoa and is expected to punish the island with life-threatening winds that have torn off roofs and sent doors flying from hinges for up to 24 hours.
“This is going to be an extremely violent phenomenon,” Governor Ricardo Rossello said. “We have not experienced an event of this magnitude in our modern history.” US President Donald Trump described Hurricane Maria as a “monster”, adding: “Our hearts are with you.”
Around 3.5 million residents were urged to seek shelter after warnings Maria could devastate Puerto Rico, a haven for people fleeing other storm-hit Caribbean islands, amid fears debris left by Hurricane Irma could cause even more damage.
Metal roofs were already flying and windows were breaking as the storm approached before dawn, with nearly 900,000 people without power.
The second maximum-strength storm to sweep through the Atlantic this month has already killed at least eight people – one person on Guadeloupe and seven people on the island of Dominica, where 90 per cent of buildings are reportedly destroyed. Details of damage are limited due to communications being down.
Maria had maximum sustained winds of 90mph as its outer eyewall began to lash the US Virgin Island of St Croix at 6am BST on Wednesday before moving west.
Describing the storm as “potentially catastrophic”, the US National Hurricane Centre said: “Some fluctuations in intensity are likely during the next day or two, but Maria is forecast to remain an extremely dangerous category four or five hurricane until it moves near or over the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.”
The storm is following a similar path to Irma, one of the most powerful in decades, and relief workers raced to secure loose debris that have the potential to make Maria more hazardous if picked up by high winds.
Damage on the British Virgin Islands is unclear after Maria skirted past early on Wednesday.
“Our islands are extremely vulnerable right now,” the territory’s premier Orlando Smith said in a statement, warning that the storm could turn debris left by Irma into dangerous projectiles.

"(N. Morgan) The events of September 11th 2001 have haunted this country and the attacks plagued with unanswered questions.
In a stunning claim, former FEMAinvestigatorKurt Sonnenfeld claims evidence he obtained conclusive proof thatthe contents of the vaults in the towers wereremoved prior to the 9/11 attacks, as if those in power knew something big was coming.
Kurt Sonnenfeld was working for the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, an organization tied to the US Department of Homeland Security, when the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center took place.
After the planes crashed into the buildings, Kurt was given unfettered access to Ground Zero- the site where the towers once stood tall.
Armed with camera gear, the 39-year-old was instructed to film everything he saw.
The evidence he documented was supposed to be a part of a report about what happened – but he never turned in the footage.
Kurt claims they want to silence him over what he saw beneath World Trade Center 6, evidence he is convinced paints the Bush Administration as big players in the deadliest attack on American soil.
Kurt wove his way through the rubble of Manhattan’s downtown financial district and shot hours of footage but never handed it in.
He says inside the building he came across a vault that had been cleared of its contents before the planes struck.
In a documentary filmed in Argentina, Kurt said the discovery is proof that America knew the attacks were coming, at the very least.
“One thing I’m certain of is that agencies of intelligence of the United States of America knew what was going to happen and at least let it happen,” he said.
“Not only did they know it was going to happen, but they in fact collaborated.”
It is given credibility by a similar discovery on a basement door below World Trade Center 4.
According to a New York Times article, the door to a vault was still intact but it appeared as if somebody had tried to gain entry.
Behind the vault door were nearly a thousand tonnes of silver and gold.
Reports describing the contents of the vaults before the attack suggest that nearly $1 billion in precious metals was stored in the vaults.
A figure of $650 million in a National Real Estate Investor article published after the attack is apparently based on pre-attack reports.
Unknown to most people at the time, $650 million in gold and silver was being kept in a special vault four floors beneath Four World Trade Center.
An article in the TimesOnline gives the following rundown of precious metals that were being stored in the WTC vault belonging to Comex.
Comex metals trading – 3,800 gold bars weighing 12 tonnes and worth more than $100 million
Comex clients – 800,000 ounces of gold with a value of about $220 million
I another twist to this ongoing saga, Kurt’s wife died under mysterious circumstances after he completed his investigation.
The cause of her death was a bullet to the back of the head…
Sonnenfeld was charged with the murder but those charges were eventually dropped, at which point he found refuge in Argentina. He has since remarried and had two children.
The U. S. Department of Justice is now attempting to extradite Sonnenfeld back to the United States where he will once again face murder charges for the death of his wife.
But Sonnenfeld says that the reasons behind the U. S. government’s push to bring him back to America are more nefarious, alluding to his intimate knowledge of the 9/11 Ground Zero crime scene as a potential reason for taking him into custody.
We know for a fact that gold was being stored under Trade Center 4. Perhaps similar riches were being stored under WTC 6.
That the vault was completely empty when Sonnenfeld carried out his investigation certainly suggests foreknowledge by highly placed insiders.

Ryan's fundraising accounted for more than half of what the NRCC raised in August, just before a round of GOP retirements put more battleground districts at risk ahead of a potentially difficult — and expensive — 2018 election for House Republicans.
In the last week, Michigan's Dave Trott, Pennsylvania's Charlie Dent and Washington's Dave Reichert announced their plans to not run for reelection, vacating competitive seats that will prove more expensive without an incumbent congressman on the ballot. Earlier this year, Florida's Ileana Ros-Lehtinen also said she would also not run for reelection, in a seat that Hillary Clinton won by 20 points in 2016.
But the NRCC's fast fundraising pace, with nearly $34.7 million banked for the 2018 campaign by the end of July, has emerged as a strength for House Republicans facing a growing battleground map. The DCCC had $22.8 million on hand at the end of July, according to the most recent FEC reports, though it has outraised the NRCC for three months in a row.
“Each retirement costs a couple million dollars of campaign money, and Republicans have over performed in recent years, so we have some vulnerabilities,” said former NRCC Chairman Tom Davis. “[But] any criticism Ryan gets, he’s a fundraising champ. It’s hard to think of anyone who has the persona that can raise money the way he’s done.”
Ryan and his affiliate groups have also written checks to 167 GOP members, totaling more than $1.5 million in direct donations. And the speaker has appeared as a special guest at 34 member events this year, raising more than $4 million. Ryan is also keeping pace with his presidential year totals from 2016. Last August, Ryan sent $2.7 million to the NRCC, bringing his total transfers to the committee to just under $30 million, a record for a sitting GOP speaker. The total nearly triples what former Speaker John Boehner sent to the NRCC in 2014, when the Ohio Republican transferred $12.6 million.
Still, Republicans privately acknowledge that the environment, including poor presidential approval ratings and historical trends for the party with the White House, will still prove difficult, even with a well-stocked campaign account. Democrats say the recent retirements are widening the playing field as they aim to chip away at the GOP's 24-seat House majority.
But filling the NRCC’s coffers will give Republicans a boost as they try to hold on to particularly expensive suburban seats, which will force House campaigns and groups to spend millions of dollars in major media markets in Philadelphia, Seattle and Miami.
“A cash on hand advantage is always good, but in a bad year, you can outspend your opponent and still lose,” said a national Republican strategist. “But it does give you an ability to create opportunities in certain places where maybe Democrats aren’t playing or they can force Democrats to protect certain seats.”
“At a certain point, the cost will force Democrats to decide — do you target [Ros-Lehtinen’s] open seat or do you go after [Rep.] Carlos Curbelo?” the source added.",0
"Researchers in Russia have been left baffled after discovering a microchip device thatthey say appears to date back 250 million years.
According to lab tests, the artefact is between 225 and 250 millions years old.
The million dollar question is, who and what used a microchip that dates back 250 million years? Is there a possibility that this is in fact the remains of ancient technology?
Technology that belonged to a highly advanced civilization that inhabited Earth millions of years ago?
Or is there a possibility that this artefact did not originate from Earth, but on another planet, belonging to an extraterrestrial race.
Better yet, what makes Russia so unique that numerous artefacts, like the one we see here, have been discovered over the years.
This “ancient microchip” was discovered in the Krasnodar region, and ufologists have already tagged this discovery as a fragment of technology previously unknown to science.
Like many other discoveries, this remarkable artefact was found by chance by a local fisherman by the name of Viktor Morozov who donated his curious finding to scholars from the University of Southern Polytechnic Nowoczerkaskiej who performed several tests and concluded that embedded into the rock, is a strange “device” which strangely resembles modern-day microchips. Researchers have not tried removing the alleged microchip from the rock in fear that the might damage it.
Geologists and researchers cannot explain the origin of this fantastic finding and there are numerous possibilities that explain what this object is. Extraterrestrial technology, evidence of sophisticated ancient societies, or just one of those strange rocks made by mother nature.
Some researchers point out that this might actually be part of a stem plant, such as lilies, skeptics have already “debunked” this finding suggesting that it is noting worth the while, just like many other discoveries which couldn’t be explained, so the best guess was… “its nothing important”, however the origin of this artefact, and many others also discovered in Russia have not been explained.
What do you believe this artefact is? Is it another rock, courtesy of mother nature? Or is this item, a microchip that belonged to an extraterrestrial race that visited Earth in the distant past?",1

"Americans have 350 million guns and 10 billion bullets. What do you honestly believe will happen when 120 million Americans cannot afford to eat? How many days would you be willing to let your children go without food? How many millions of your neighbors, friends and families will have to die before the Uber Rich learn to not steal from the poor?
How many millions will have to starve to death before Wall Street hears our voices?
In 1929 there were 123 million Americans. Three million starved to death. The Uber Rich made no fundamental reforms to the banking system to avoid another collapse. If anything, our government has become even more greedy and corrupt.
Fortunately for the elite, most people do not understand money. Let me explain a home mortgage as a fraud. Suppose a young couple applies for a homeloan. If approved for a $350,000 loan, the banker gives the couple a checking account credit for that amount. Did he loan them Mrs Jones’ savings? No. He created money out of thin air and charged them interest. By adding to the money supply, he just devalued the purchasing power of our wages and pensions. The banker worked for a few minutes and made more money from that home than did the electrician, the plumber or even the foreman.
The Bank of England hath the benefit of interest on money it created out of nothing.     William Paterson 1694, First Governor of the Bank of England.
America is nothing like it was in the 1930s. We have added 200 million people. Millions of Jews came in the 1930s and millions more after the war. But I doubt that Jews will be starving to death. The Democrats changed immigration laws in the 1960s to allow a lot more non-white immigration. We are no longer a racially cohesive society. In fact liberalism has been based on Identity politics for several decades.The non-whites were told by Jewish liberals in themedia, the Foundations, theuniversitiesand the schools that they were poor because white people arerich.
Whites do not own the media and Hollywood that demonizes them.
I read recently another article about the Overton Window. That is to say what is acceptable and unacceptable public speech in America. If our wages are cut 20% and our rents are doubled, we are not allowed to complain about immigration being excessive as that is racist. Gentile speech is regulated by a mostly Jewish elite. Jews and Gentiles live in different Americas. I doubt that few if any of the 3 million Americans who starved to death in the 1930s were Jewish.
Liberalism decided that massive immigration while exporting jobs was good. Liberals covered up our poor jobs and pay situation by creating 31 million federal, state and local government workers whose salaries are paid by borrowed money. Gentile poverty had been covered up in the past because the US dollar was the international reserve currency. In 1973 Henry Kissinger created the Petrodollar system which required people all over the world to buy oil with dollars. The US was allowed to buy things from overseas by printing dollars. Young workers have had pay cuts of 20% from what the previous generation made for the same jobs. But when the dollar collapses as a reserve currency, wages will drop 50%. We will be shocked by reality.
We are entering a period when foreigners will increasingly dump dollars and drive prices out of reach of diminished Gentile paychecks. Imported prices will increase 500%. Foreigners will buy our food because it will be cheap to them. We willhave to cut spending on government programs that some people really need. An example would be Food Stamps. At least 120 million Americans will be eating as little as one meal a day or even less. We can expect Nationwide Food Riots on the Day the Dollar Dies. We can expect every major American city to be destroyed.
As I said, Americans have 350 million guns and 10 billion bullets. Presently, Americans are not allowed to do anything to defend themselves from assaults either by criminals or by the police. When the Dollar Dies, government and its rules will collapse. On that day our only police force will be the gun underneath our coat or the rifle in our car. Once the violence starts, one hundred million bullets could be fired in a relatively short period of time.
One option would be to escalate from 100 million to 200 to 300 and on up to one billion bullets fired at people in America. Another option would be for the government to declare martial law. That would not stop the violence as the Army has no food and cannot double wages for those who cannot afford to eat. But the US military could arrest the Bankers and seize $50 trillion from them. That is the amount of money that Catherine Austin Fitts said the Bankers stole from us. We could use that money to fund Debt Cancellation. The ancient kings of Sumer and Babylon stopped Depressions 4,400 years ago by cancelling Unpayable Debts. Of course we would need a non-interest bearing currency like President Lincoln’s Greenbacks. If we had that now, there would be no $20 trillion national debt and no crumbling infrastructure.
The third option is that we let the Bankers go into underground bunkers as their agents release a series of plagues killing 7 billion Gentiles.",1
"During President Donald Trump’s rally in Youngstown, Ohio, this past Tuesday evening. He was interrupted many times, mostly for applause, but also because of some because weak minded individuals from the left are still upset that Crooked Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders lost the 2016 Presidential Election.
But the two protesters who in particular stood out the most was a man who decided it was ok to hold up a sign for the communist rag website RefuseFascism.org, and an individual who thought it would be ok to wave the flag of the Soviet Union during the rally.
Unsurprisingly, the crowd didn’t take kindly to either protester and they were swiftly removed by security.
As clearly seen in the video above. The communist protester who was wearing a “Hopeless” T-shirt, held the large Soviet flag up which caused a stir around him. One of the Trump supporters from a few rows behind him quickly grabbed the flag from the ignoramus and trounced on it. The young man then moved up toward the guy who took the flag and the two appear to struggle over it as security arrived and grabbed the protester and forcibly escorted him out of the rally as chants of “USA! USA!” rang throughout the venue.
Why Communism does not Work
Throughout history we have seen the idea of communism in nations evolve from a small beginning to a world-altering superpower. And while it is easy to see why communism doesn’t work on a large scale (take a look at Russia, Cuba, China, etc. you get the picture), communism itself is an idea as foolproof as making your password ‘abc123’. Not to say that it’s an idiot’s idea, it’s just you would need to be an idiot to use it. Even in small scale, communism does not work.
So to start off, let’s have a brief history lesson. What is communism? Communism is the political idea made famous by Karl Marx that we can live in a society where the people are the government; a society where everyone is equal and everyone is granted the same amount of wealth. No upper class, no middle class, no lower class, only the working class to make the nation great and powerful. Pure equality. What’s wrong with this?
In large scale we’ve seen this novel idea become corrupted. Equal wealth would mean very little wealth. Working to make the nation great would mean working 20 hours a day. The working class would starve and live in poverty, and need a force greater than itself to keep everyone in line and focussed. Deviation from communism would mean death. You see, we as human beings are lost without a power to tell us what to do. The only reason you would say otherwise is if you are the one giving the orders and having people work under them. You could argue against that by saying that our individual sovereignty has yielded amazing structures, theories and creations, but everything we know is based off the knowledge of someone else. Whether you realize (or like) it or not, you are the product of somebody else’s ideas and reality; there is no escaping that. And that is why ensured equality cannot and does not exist; many of us need to be told what to do.
So now in small scale. We’ve all been to parties. Most of us have, anyway. If we haven’t, we’ve all belonged to a group of some sort (school is a group, too). We all have friends and family and this and that.
So what does this have to do with communism?
In our group of friends, we would consider ourselves equal. We are all workers in one way or another, and with our friends we can escape that. And yet at parties we as friends throw for each other, there is always that one person who is shunted off to the side. Even when a group of like-minded friends get together, a class system emerges. There is always the life of the party, the coordinator, the outcast, etc. And there is no escaping it. Equality cannot exist because we as humans do not allow it to exist; our minds and emotions do not allow it to exist. And because we cannot force our mindsets and program humans to get rid of those emotions, true equality will never exist.
People are not robots. We cannot manufacture a perfect human being that is free of judgement and sentient thought. We can try, but it won’t happen. People have tried and they’ve created monsters. And thus communism, the idea that a society of equal-classed workers can rule themselves, cannot exist. It is a novel idea, though.
It’s truly heartbreaking to see this. Where are these kids getting their history? Communism was the leading ideological cause of death during the 20th century. 94 million were slaughtered in China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, Afghanistan, and Eastern Europe. Meanwhile during the same period of time 28 million died under fascist regimes, which also originate on the left side of the political spectrum.
If you add all the numbers together more people died as a result of communism than from homicide, 58 million, and genocide, 30 million, put together. Yet today 51% of Millenials prefer some kind of socialism or communism over the capitalistic system. Who is educating these people and why don’t they just go live in Cuba or Venezuela instead of trying to ruin the country we all hold so dear?
Please share if you agree schools should teach the truth about Communism….

"ORGANICS BOARD BRACES FOR HYDROPONIC FIGHT: USDA’s organic advisory panel is once again going to consider whether to continue to allow non-soil based production systems to be certified as organic. After punting on the issue last spring, the National Organic Standards Board has a handful of proposals in front of it this week during a four-day meeting in Jacksonville, Fla., that would ban aquaponic and aeroponic production while seriously curtailing other container systems.
The fight pits advocates of stricter adherence to organic rules that put heavy emphasis on the role of the soil in farming and the environment against relative newcomers to the industry who say that soil-less systems could help bolster organic supplies at a time when production acres are not much.
To be sure, soil-less production is still a relatively small portion of organic. A 2016 survey conducted by the National Organic Program found that of 31,000 organic operations, 30 were hydroponic, 22 were aquaponic and 69 were container-based. In total, soil-free methods accounted for just 0.4 percent of all USDA organic operations, according to the survey.
Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue could ultimately make a determination on hydroponics and related farming. So far, hasn't shown his hand on any of the various proposals. But generally speaking, he has been vocal about his mission of following through with the White House’s push to reduce regulations and foster business. The full story from Pro Agriculture’s Jenny Hopkinson is here.

TAX REFORM 101: How does our tax system really work? Who pays what — and how does it all add up? And how does the American tax system compare to international competitors? POLITICO’s new explainer video series has you covered. Tax Reform with Bernie Becker is the first of an issue-based animated video series that pairs expert reporters with Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, Matt Wuerker, to provide you with a new way of digesting the news. Click HERE to watch.
FIRST TAXES, THEN NAFTA?: Former U. S. ambassador to Mexico Jim Jones, in an interview with Pro’s Sabrina Rodriguez, speculated that the future of NAFTA would depend on the outcome of President Donald Trump’s tax reform as the pressure is on for him to deliver on his campaign pledges. “Trump is less interested in substance than he is in political victories,” said Jones, who helped oversee the passage and implementation of NAFTA during the Clinton administration. “If the tax bill passes, he’d be more interested in listening to reason.”
The future rests on agriculture and business interests: Jones added that agricultural interests would be a linchpin in persuading the administration to stick with NAFTA, and that pressure from groups will be ratcheting up after the tax reform debate is over. “By that time, the business and agriculture leadership is going to be so outraged at the possibility of leaving NAFTA that there’s a good chance we’ll negotiate.”
The view from the Bayou State: Our Morning Trade colleague, Doug Palmer, is in New Orleans, where NAFTA is also on the mind of a lot of folks. Charles Boustany, who previously represented Louisiana’s third congressional district before losing a bid last year for the Senate, told Doug that he believed a decision by Trump to withdraw from NAFTA would hurt the whole state.
“I think our agricultural community and the business community would be very upset,” Boustany said. Mexico is consistently one of the state’s top three trading partners, along with China and Japan, and anything that disrupts trade with that country could ripple throughout Louisiana’s economy. In addition, Louisiana rice growers depend heavily on exports to Mexico, Boustany said.
CHEF JOS ANDRS RETURNS FROM PUERTO RICO: After distributing 2 million freshly cooked meals to Puerto Ricans — more than any other relief organization — José Andrés has now returned to Washington, D. C., with a faith in humanity “multiplied by ten.” His faith in government, however, is jaded.
The celebrity chef, during an event hosted by the Washington Post on Friday that also featured Alice Waters, reflected on his nearly two months of disaster relief efforts on the island through his nonprofit World Central Kitchen. Andrés has criticized the Trump administration’s response as well as the president himself. On Friday, however, he declined to address Trump directly. “I don’t think we have to say anything to one person. I think we have to keep all of us talking between us,” Andrés said.
Andrés has expressed frustration with FEMA over its lack of support of World Central Kitchen, essentially because of red tape and regulations like meal thresholds. The nonprofit now has negotiated a $10 million contract with FEMA to serve food for another two weeks. During Friday’s panel, he said his operation was spending almost $400,000 a day and operating many millions in the red.
Lack of communication, not water. Puerto Rico has plenty of active “oasis” stations to supply the population with water, but there was a lack of leadership, Andrés said. “Puerto Rico needed 1 million gallons [of water a day]. They have that on the island. The only things that had to be done was making sure the generators were functioning, which was not hard to do, he said. “This information was not delivered. Nobody wanted to touch the water.”
Help the bees: Meanwhile the Pollinator Partnership is working to get aid to the island’s 150 beekeepers that lost many of their 4,000 hives. The group has sent food and is working on getting new hive boxes down to the island.
— Sam Clovis' hearing will be soon: The Senate Agriculture Committee is closing in on a confirmation hearing date for Sam Clovis, the Trump administration’s nominee to be USDA chief scientist. Chairman Pat Roberts told E&E News last week that Clovis’ hearing would be on Nov. 9, but a spokeswoman for the committee said Friday that the panel was ""not ready to announce a date"" because it was working through ""scheduling details."" More on the controversial nominee from Pro Ag’s Catherine Boudreau here.
— Pushing for prosecution under Magnuson Stevens: Rep. Raúl Grijalva and Rep. Chellie Pingree have written a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross encouraging him to further fine New Bedford, Mass., fishing mogul Carlos “the Codfather” Rafael with civil penalties over his violations under the Magnuson Stevens Act. It also praise Department of Justice officials for appealing a federal judge’s decision that allows Rafael to keep at least 27 boats.
— Ranchers wanting answers: Several ranchers in South Dakota did not get a chance to meet with Perdue last week to question him about the recent GIPSA actions, Tri-State Livestock News reports. They were expecting to see him at the offices of the Natural Resources Conservation Services in Timber Lake, S. D., but Perdue left the office before a media availability event was to begin.
— Butterball gets a no-confidence vote: Cook’s Illustrated wrote in its November/ December issue that consumers should avoid Butterball for their Thanksgiving turkey. The company declined to provide the magazine information about the age of its turkeys and whether the turkeys were vegetarian fed. In addition, the magazine rated eight supermarket turkeys for taste and Butterball was the only one on its “not recommended” list.
— Fears grow that EU glyphosate ban could disrupt global trade: Some agricultural powerhouses fear that if glyphosate’s license is blocked, EU countries will be under pressure to restrict imported products containing the commonly used weedkiller. More from POLITICO Europe’s Simon Marks and Giulia Paravicini here.
— Texas farmers saw $200 million in damage from Hurricane Harvey: That’s according to a new estimate from Texas A&M University. Cotton farmers saw roughly half of the losses, the livestock industry saw $93 million in damage, and rice and soybean growers took an $8 million hit, Jenny Hopkinson reports. However, Texas Observer points out the losses from Harvey are “a shadow” of the estimated damage done in Texas by Hurricane Ike in 2008 and just a fraction of the vast damage done by Hurricane Irma, especially to Florida’s citrus groves and other crop fields.
— O’Brien to head co-op association: Doug O’Brien, the former senior adviser for rural affairs on President Barack Obama’s White House Domestic Policy Council, has been named president and CEO of the National Cooperative Business Association. O’Brien, who joined the group after leaving the White House in November 2016 as executive vice president for programs, will start his new job on Jan. 1, 2018.
— The perils of chlorpyrifos: The New York Times's op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof turns a critical eye on Dow Chemical’s hard-to-pronounce pesticide and argues that after the “quotidian craziness” of the Trump White House “is forgotten, Americans will be caring for victims of the chemical industry’s takeover of safety regulation.”
— New welfare standards for Chicken McNuggets: McDonald’s is requiring its suppliers like Cargill and Tyson to follow standards for raising and slaughtering chickens. But it still falls short of their competitors, Reuters reports.
— Life after TPP-12 goes on (but will that continue?): The 11 remaining members of the TPP are meeting outside Tokyo today in an attempt to reach an agreement, but the new New Zealand leader’s demands for renegotiation are threatening the chances that members will be able to agree, Nikkei Asian Review reports.
THE WEEK AHEAD: It’s a busy week for many top USDA officials. This morning, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue is scheduled to swear in Greg Ibach as undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs. He’s swearing him in at the Livestock Exchange Building in Omaha.
Today also marks the deadline for USDA to respond to a bipartisan committee request for details about senior officials using private jets. House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy said he and other elected officials were prepared to issue a subpoena if they do not receive any records by Oct. 31. On Sept. 26, a bipartisan group requested these records from 24 federal departments and the West Wing. The USDA and the Department of Justice are the only two agencies that have not responded to the request.
The undersecretary for trade and agricultural foreign affairs Ted McKinney leaves today for his first USDA trade mission in his new role. He will be going to India, where he is scheduled to lead a delegation of 50 business, trade and government groups. His travels take him to Mumbai and New Delhi and he returns home on Friday, Nov. 3.

"Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has accused the US led coalition of being reluctant to bomb positions of the former Al-Nusra Front in Syria.
He urged them to ditch their “double standards” for the sake of an “uncompromising” fight against terrorism.
Lavrov said: “There is a strong impression, based on our fight with terrorism in Syria, that the so-called Al-Nusra [Front], or whatever it is called now, is every time spared by the coalition forces headed by the United States and its allies”
The foreign minister went on to say that “new evidence has emerged in the past few days” indicating that the US-led international forces continue “to take the heat off” the former Al-Qaeda offshoot in Syria.
Slamming what appears to be a reluctance by the coalition to target the terrorist group as “an extremely dangerous game,” Lavrov called on the US-led forces to set aside “all double standards and any ulterior thoughts” in favor of an “uncompromising fight against terrorism.”
In a recent phone conversation held between Lavrov and his US counterpart, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, at the latter’s initiative, the Russian official emphasized the importance of preventing provocations against the Syrian armed forces battling terrorists and urged the US to step up its fight against jihadists in Syria.
Moscow has been increasingly critical of Washington’s conduct in Syria since the US bombed the Shayrat Air Base in response to an alleged chemical attack in Syria’s Idlib province. During talks between Lavrov and Tillerson in Moscow, the Russian foreign minister said that they had agreed that an “highly provocative” incident similar to the US airstrike “should not happen again.”
However, on June 18, a Syrian Su-22 warplane was shot down over Raqqa province in an attack by the US-led coalition. The incident was labelled by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov as “an act of aggression” and “actually help for the terrorists the US is fighting.”
While Washington argued it had downed the jet because it was dropping bombs on the US-allied militia fighting Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), Damascus dismissed the allegations, saying that the plane was in effect in the middle of an operation against the IS militants.",1

"In its first financial report since the deadliest mass shooting in modern U. S. history was carried out from one of its properties, MGM Resorts International on Wednesday reported third-quarter net income of $149.1 million.
Chairman and CEO Jim Murren told analysts, investors and media during the company's earnings call that the shooting at the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino did not have an impact on current results, but cancellations and the suspension of marketing efforts are expected to weigh down fourth-quarter figures.
""The entire town did the right thing,"" he said. ""We all took a pause in marketing out of respect for those affected.""
On Oct. 1, a 64-year-old high-stakes gambler and real estate investor killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after he shattered windows of his hotel suite and unleashed withering gunfire at the Route 91 Harvest music festival below before killing himself.
MGM Resorts also owns the venue were the festival took place.
Murren said the company initially saw a spike in non-group cancellations — about double what is normal — and a decline in bookings. Cancellations progressively subsided by mid-October and bookings returned to normal levels around the same time.
""While we anticipate near-term impact ... we are confident in the resilience of this community and its ability to remain the leading entertainment and business destination for the roughly 43 million people a year that visit us,"" Murren said
MGM debuted a national advertising campaign in September with the goal of showing its force within the entertainment industry and ending the notion that it is only a casino-operating company. The campaign, with slogans like ""We are not in the hotel business ... we are in the holy s--- business,"" remains on hold and won't air until 2018, Murren said.
Revenue per available room, a key measure for hotels and resorts, will likely see a percentage decline in the single digits in the fourth quarter.
The Las Vegas company's third-quarter profit translates to 26 cents per share, or 33 cents per share when adjusted for non-recurring items. That's in line with Wall Street expectations, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue per available room rose 4 percent to $156 at the company's Las Vegas Strip resorts.
Casino revenue jumped 32 percent as the company continues to incorporate the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa into its operations. It purchased the casino and resort in August of 2016.
Shares of MGM Resorts International added nearly 6 percent to $33.31 in afternoon trading.

"Recently I was asked whether, if Trump succeeded in undermining the Joint Plan of Collective Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear deal, whether Iran would reply by going for broke to create a nuclear weapon. A related question is whether a collapse of the JCPOA would strengthen Iran’s hard liners.
Here is what I said.
Iran’s clerical leader,Ayatollah Ali Khameneiwill not allow development of a nuclear weapon. He has repeatedly given fatwas or considered legal opinions that making, stockpiling and using nuclear weapons contravenes Islamic law. In formal Islamic law, you cannot target civilians. The Qur’an says, “Fight those who fight you.” In Iran’s Shiite Islam, by the way, only defensive jihad or holy war is allowed. An atomic bomb, as the US demonstrated at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, kills very large numbers of innocent civilians. Khamenei can’t climb down from decades of such fatwas without undermining his clerical authority and hence the foundations of his entire regime. Saying he secretly wants a bomb is like asserting thatPope Francishas a covert condom factory in the Vatican basement.
Iran has never had the aim of creating a bomb or it would have one by now.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps and hard line scientists and engineers tried to finesse Khamenei. They seem to have convinced him to allow them to developing facilities and experiments leading to expertise and capabilities with regard to nuclear weapon production. This capability amounts to what specialists call nuclear latency or the “Japan option.” That is, if the world knows you could slap together a nuclear bomb tout de suite, they are less likely to invade you. Everyone knows Japan has stockpiles of plutonium and technical know-how, and that they could produce a nuclear weapon in short order if they felt really threatened. Trump even encouraged them to go this route.
The Iranian hard liners likewise wanted a deterrence effect via a short time-line to a break-out capacity, i.e. potential bomb production, especially after the US invasions and occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. As long as they didn’t actually make a bomb, they could escape the ayatollah’s wrath.
Because of Obama’s severe sanctions from 2012, a short time-like to break-out incurred unacceptable costs for nuclear doves like Rouhani, who got Khamenei’s ear and warned him of civil unrest a la 2009 if sanctions continued. Iran was kicked off currency exchanges and had trouble selling its oil, being forced to reduce exports by 1 mn. barrels per day, from 2.5 mn. b/d down to 1.5. (It is back up toexporting2.6 million barrels per day of petroleum and condensates, but the price has collapsed).
The compromise reached in the JCPOA by the UN Security Council plus Germany was that Iran could keep latency, i.e. the expertise for a Japan option, but had to lengthen its time-line to break-out. It bricked in and abandoned its planned heavy water reactor at Arak. It limited the number of its centrifuges. It destroyed stockpiles of uranium enriched to 19.5% for its medical isotopes reactor. It consented to regular inspections of its facilities by the UN. (Plutonium signatures can be detected months later and no matter how you try to vacuum up the particles, so Iran really can’t cheat as long as it is inspected).
Iran retained latency capabilities and nothing in JCPOA forbade them. What JCPOA insisted on was a long production time-line rather than a short one, i.e. 6 to 8 months rather than a few weeks.
As long as Iran does not ramp up production capabilities to shorten the break-out time-line, it is in compliance.
The cult, the Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK, i.e the People’s Jihadis, is now pushing a line that something sinister is going on at the Parchin military base. The UN inspectors visited it in 2015 and are not interested in going there again. The Non-Proliferation Treaty excluded inspections of military facilities at US and USSR insistence, and the JCPOA followed that legal tradition. The MEK, which is a small terrorist organization that wants to overthrow the Iranian government in favor of its mixture of Shiite fundamentalism and Marxism, has some sort of shadowy and creepy relationship with AIPAC and the Israel lobbies. Giuliani regularly speaks for big bucks at their meetings. This sort of thing is much more suspicious than the Russian connection.
If, however, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the agency charged with inspecting Iran, wanted to visit Parchin again, centristPresident Hassan Rouhaniwould allow it. Transparency benefits him.
The IAEA does not want to visit Parchin because they think the optics of such a request at this time would aid Trump hawks in undermining JCPOA.
By signing the deal, Iran gave up substantial deterrence effects of nuclear latency for the sake of ending sanctions and reducing tensions, by accepting a long break-out time-line. That is, its leaders accepted a situation where the country was somewhat more likely to be invaded or the government overthrown by hostile great powers like the US.
Iran has received almost nothing in return. The GOP Congress, taking its cue from the Israel lobby, has actually ratcheted up US sanctions on Iran, which is a violation of the JCPOA. Moreover, the Trump people have rattled sabers and spooked European investors. Nobody wants to be sanctioned by the US Department of the Treasury, which has in the past fined European firms billions of dollars for doing business with Iran. There has been a small uptick of Iranian trade with Europe and Asia, but the hard liners are slamming Rouhani for giving away the country’s security and returning empty-handed.
Now Trump is inventing some special US certification procedure for Iran compliance, which is not in the JCPOA, and is aimed at undermining it. I doubt Europe will go along with this scam. Maybe someone should inspect the unsafe thousands of US nuclear warheads. Iran does not have any.
Nuclear Israel is threatening to bomb Damascus over Iran’s Syria presence, and is pressuring Russia to expel Iran. The JCPOA weakened Iran vis-a-vis Israel by reducing the deterrence effects of latency. The world community, which tried to reduce Iran to a fourth world country for merely doing some nuclear experiments, has actively rewarded Israel for flouting the Non-Proliferation Treaty and building a stockpile of some 400 nuclear warheads, with which it occasionally menaces its neighbors.
So yes, all this strengthens hard liners and weakens Rouhani.
But China and Russia want the JCPOA and Iran is unlikely to try to get a bomb both for this reason and because of Khomeinist commitments (Khomeini, the father of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, called nukes the tools of the devil, and his successor, Ali Khamenei, agrees).
However, hard liners could try to shorten the break-out window again if they felt the West had severely violated the terms of the deal.

"Amazon is set to begin hosting the first of its 10 Thursday Night Football games with tonight's match-up between the Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears. As consumers continue to be faced with a deluge of content options and cord-cutting becomes more popular, it remains to be seen whether consumers will fork out an extra $99 per year for something they can already get for free.
Amazon is betting heavily (to the tune of a reported $50 million for the streaming rights) that customers will want to watch the game on Amazon's Video service. Last year, Twitter paid a reported $10 million for the games, which demonstrates that Amazon is willing to pay up for the chance to acquire new Prime subscribers.
""In order to enhance its value proposition in a highly competitive [over-the-top] market, Amazon needs appealing, differentiated content,"" Tom Richardson, a sports industry veteran who teaches digital media in Columbia University’s Sports Management masters program, wrote in a recent LinkedIn article.
Amazon has been building up its content offerings for Prime Video, which competes with the likes of Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, as well as other traditional media. In addition to the Thursday games, which Richardson added are a ""pretty safe bet,"" it has a number of its own shows, including ""Man in the High Castle,"" ""The Tick"" and ""Transparent,"" which has received critical acclaim in the form of both Emmy nominations and wins.
The streaming service is also reportedly looking to add its own version of HBO's mega-hit show, ""Game of Thrones,"" according to media reports.
Though Amazon may not see a flood of new subscribers for Amazon Prime because of the streaming rights, it's clearly part of expanding the benefits of the service.
""This is virgin territory for Amazon, which has never had major sports rights before, and of course it’s for a single game a week for only some of the weeks of one season, so it’s a pretty limited offering,"" Jackdaw Research chief analyst Jan Dawson told Fox News.
Dawson added, ""I’ve no doubt Amazon will see some new signups as a result of offering the Thursday night games, but I can’t see it moving the overall needle much relative to its existing strong growth in Prime subscribers.""
Richardson agreed, saying that it probably will not be a determing factor in adding new Prime subscribers, but it will likely ""at the very least, enhance the perceived value of Prime membership.""
Amazon has never publicly disclosed how many Prime users it has, but third-party research from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners puts Amazon Prime membership at around 80 million people in the U. S. alone.
In addition to the games available to U. S. Prime members, they will also be available to Prime Video members internationally in more than 200 countries.
In announcing the deal this past April, the NFL said Amazon would stream 10 Thursday Night Football games, which are also broadcast by NBC and CBS, giving the league a ""tri-cast"" model of reaching viewers: broadcast via NBC and CBS, cable via the NFL Network and digital.
""We are continually looking for ways to deliver our games to fans wherever they watch, whether on television or on digital platforms and we are thrilled to bring Thursday Night Football to Amazon,"" Brian Rolapp, Chief Media and Business Officer for the NFL said at the time of the announcement. ""As has been the case with all our streaming initiatives, we look forward to continuing to innovate with our partners as we learn the best ways to serve our fans both this season and into the future.""
It's important that Amazon, with its millions of Prime subscribers, helps show ratings growth for Thursday Night Football and the league in general.
Viewers and experts have often bemoaned the quality of the Thursday night games, with reasons like short weeks and players not fully recovered from the previous games oft mentioned. According to football website, ProFootball Talk, the NFL Network has seen two consecutive weeks of ratings growth over the 2016 season, including last week's thrilling shoot-out between the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers, which had 7.4 million viewers.
Twitter has said in the past it averaged around 3.5 million unique viewers per game, a fraction of what games on broadcast TV get. Twitter also let anyone (including those without a Twitter account) watch the games, so the pressure is on Amazon to deliver strong engagement and viewing figures.
Amazon, for its part, is looking to add new features to keep users engaged.
In an email to Fox News, the company said it would offer alternate language audio of the games (including Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, and U. K. English streams, one of which will have well-known soccer announcer Tommy Smyth), its own kickoff show, NFL trivia from Alexa and custom-themed Amazon boxes.
AMAZON'S LACK OF INCOME TAXES PAID HAS BECOME AN 'UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTION'
The league is also mired in controversy as President Donald Trump stirred the proverbial pot last Friday, saying at a rally in Alabama that players who do not stand for the National Anthem should be fired. ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'get that son of a b**** off the field right now - he's fired,'"" Trump said.
Trump has continued to make similar remarks on Twitter, including this one referencing the ratings for the league.
Though the NFL has multi-year, multi-billion dollar deals locked up with cable companies such as CBS, Disney and 21st Century Fox (the parent company of this website), the league is continuing to push towards streaming.
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, one of the most influential owners in the league, said the future for the NFL is over-the-top, a term used to reference non-traditional content such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.
“This year we’re with Amazon and for us the future is OTT,” Kraft said during an interview at the Cannes Lions festival in France in June, as reported by Fox Business. “We’ll be very interested to see how Amazon goes as it’s behind the paywall. The thing we have to be careful of is millennials. They don’t watch TV, they don’t have TVs or subscribe to cable. So we have to bring that audience in. Partly it’s done through fantasy games and linking to that. Over-the-top is a great opportunity.”
According to Bloomberg, the tech giant paid $50 million for the games, with the potential for an additional $30 million in marketing and promotion. By contrast, Twitter, which had the streaming rights to Thursday Night Football in 2016, paid approximately $10 million.
Part of the marketing and promotion is ironically showing up on Twitter, where the hashtag #TNFonPrimeVideo is being promoted by Amazon Video.
TRUMP ATTACKS AMAZON, SAYS IT'S DOING 'GREAT DAMAGE' TO RETAILERS
While it's likely to help show an increase in interest in Amazon's Prime subscription service, it could also help the company's burgeoning advertising business.
Per the agreement with the NFL, Amazon can sell a ""limited number of advertisements"" during the broadcasts, in addition to the ones aired from CBS and NBC. Fox Business reported that the company could charge as much as $2.8 million per 30 second spot.
According to media reports, Barclays estimated Amazon generated around $1.4 billion in advertising revenue in 2016, a figure that pales in comparison to those of both Google and Facebook.
While the deal is an experiment for now (Amazon already airs some NFL-related programming, including ""All or Nothing""), it could be a precursor for viewing rights to come in the future.
A majority of the NFL's rights deals expire in either 2021 or 2022, so companies like Amazon could potentially bid on them when they come up for renewal. If the experiment goes well, analysts could see Kraft's words, that over-the-top is the future, come to fruition.
""As the additional rights come up for renewal, the digital players will definitely be big bidders against the traditional TV companies, and we’ll have to see to what extent the NFL chooses to parcel out streaming and TV rights separately or encourages single bids including both components,"" Dawson said.",0

"(Before It's News)
In research that may prove useful to future lunar explorers, scientists from Brown University have created the first quantitative map of water and its chemical building blocks trapped in the uppermost portion of the Moon’s soil.
The study, published in Science Advances, builds on the initial discovery in 2009 of water and a related molecule — hydroxyl, which consists of one atom each of hydrogen and oxygen — in the lunar soil. The latest study uses a new calibration of data taken from NASA’s Moon Mineralogy Mapper, which flew aboard India’s Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, to quantify how much water is present on a global scale.
“The signature of water is present nearly everywhere on the lunar surface, not limited to the polar regions as previously reported,” said the study’s lead author, Shuai Li, who performed the work while a Ph. D. student at Brown University and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Hawaii. “The amount of water increases toward the poles and does not show significant difference among distinct compositional terrains.”
The water concentration reaches a maximum average of around 500 to 750 parts per million in the higher latitudes. That’s not a lot — less than is found in the sands of Earth’s driest deserts — but it’s also not nothing.
“This is a roadmap to where water exists on the surface of the Moon,” said Ralph Milliken, an associate professor at Brown and Li’s co-author. “Now that we have these quantitative maps showing where the water is and in what amounts, we can start thinking about whether or not it could be worthwhile to extract, either as drinking water for astronauts or to produce fuel.”
The map shows a general trend of increasing water content (purple, green and yellos) toward the poles. The dots mark the Apollo landing sites.
The researchers say that the way the water is distributed across the Moon gives clues about its source. The distribution is largely uniform rather than splotchy, with concentrations gradually decreasing toward the equator. That pattern is consistent with implantation via solar wind — the constant bombardment of protons from the sun, which can form hydroxyl and molecular water once emplaced.
Although the bulk of the water mapped in this study could be attributed to solar wind, there were exceptions. For example, the researchers found higher-than-average concentrations of water in lunar volcanic deposits near the Moon’s equator, where background water in the soil is scarce. Rather than coming from solar wind, the water in those localized deposits likely comes from deep within the Moon’s mantle and erupted to the surface in lunar magma. Li and Milliken reported those findings separately in July of this year.
The study also found that the concentration of water changes over the course of the lunar day at latitudes lower than 60 degrees, going from wetter in the early morning and evening to much drier around lunar noon. The fluctuation can be as much as 200 parts per million.
“We don’t know exactly what the mechanism is for this fluctuation, but it tells us that the process of water formation in the lunar soil is active and happening today,” Milliken said. “This raises the possibility that water may re-accumulate after extraction, but we need to better understand the physics of why and how this happens to understand the timescale over which water may be renewed.”
Li says that laboratory research could be useful in better understanding these kinds of processes. “We hope this motivates the planetary community to continue lab experiments to understand the interaction of solar wind with the lunar soil and possible mechanisms for how water migrates across the lunar surface on these relatively short timescales,” he said.
As useful as the new maps may be, they still leave plenty of unanswered questions about lunar water. The Moon Mineralogy Mapper, which supplied the data for the research, measures light reflected off of the lunar surface. That means that it can’t look for water in places that are permanently shadowed from the sun’s rays. Many scientists think these permanently shadowed regions, such as the floors on impact craters in the Moon’s polar regions, could hold large deposits or water ice.
“Those ice deposits may indeed be there,” Milliken said, “but because they are in shadowed areas it’s not something we can easily confirm using these data.”
It’s also not clear how deep into the soil the water mapped in the study goes.
“We’re only sensing the upper millimeter or so of soil, and we can’t say for sure what the water content is like underneath that,” Milliken said. “The distribution of water with depth could make a big difference in terms of how much water is actually there.”
Still, the researchers say, the study provides a good starting point for thinking about how lunar water resources might be utilized.
“It remains to be seen whether extraction could be feasible,” Milliken said. “But these results show us what the range of water availability across the surface is so we can start thinking about where we might want to go to get it and whether it makes economic sense to do so.”
The research was funded by the NASA Lunar Advanced Science and Exploration Research Program (NNX12AO63G).",1

How important is Amazon's NFL deal for Amazon and the future of the league?
Amazon is set to begin hosting the first of its 10 Thursday Night Football games with tonight's match-up between the Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears. As consumers continue to be faced with a deluge of content options and cord-cutting becomes more popular, it remains to be seen whether consumers will fork out an extra $99 per year for something they can already get for free.
Amazon is betting heavily (to the tune of a reported $50 million for the streaming rights) that customers will want to watch the game on Amazon's Video service. Last year, Twitter paid a reported $10 million for the games, which demonstrates that Amazon is willing to pay up for the chance to acquire new Prime subscribers.
""In order to enhance its value proposition in a highly competitive [over-the-top] market, Amazon needs appealing, differentiated content,"" Tom Richardson, a sports industry veteran who teaches digital media in Columbia University’s Sports Management masters program, wrote in a recent LinkedIn article.
Amazon has been building up its content offerings for Prime Video, which competes with the likes of Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, as well as other traditional media. In addition to the Thursday games, which Richardson added are a ""pretty safe bet,"" it has a number of its own shows, including ""Man in the High Castle,"" ""The Tick"" and ""Transparent,"" which has received critical acclaim in the form of both Emmy nominations and wins.
The streaming service is also reportedly looking to add its own version of HBO's mega-hit show, ""Game of Thrones,"" according to media reports.
Though Amazon may not see a flood of new subscribers for Amazon Prime because of the streaming rights, it's clearly part of expanding the benefits of the service.
""This is virgin territory for Amazon, which has never had major sports rights before, and of course it’s for a single game a week for only some of the weeks of one season, so it’s a pretty limited offering,"" Jackdaw Research chief analyst Jan Dawson told Fox News.
Dawson added, ""I’ve no doubt Amazon will see some new signups as a result of offering the Thursday night games, but I can’t see it moving the overall needle much relative to its existing strong growth in Prime subscribers.""
Richardson agreed, saying that it probably will not be a determing factor in adding new Prime subscribers, but it will likely ""at the very least, enhance the perceived value of Prime membership.""
Amazon has never publicly disclosed how many Prime users it has, but third-party research from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners puts Amazon Prime membership at around 80 million people in the U. S. alone.
In addition to the games available to U.S. Prime members, they will also be available to Prime Video members internationally in more than 200 countries.
In announcing the deal this past April, the NFL said Amazon would stream 10 Thursday Night Football games, which are also broadcast by NBC and CBS, giving the league a ""tri-cast"" model of reaching viewers: broadcast via NBC and CBS, cable via the NFL Network and digital.
""We are continually looking for ways to deliver our games to fans wherever they watch, whether on television or on digital platforms and we are thrilled to bring Thursday Night Football to Amazon,"" Brian Rolapp, Chief Media and Business Officer for the NFL said at the time of the announcement. ""As has been the case with all our streaming initiatives, we look forward to continuing to innovate with our partners as we learn the best ways to serve our fans both this season and into the future.""
It's important that Amazon, with its millions of Prime subscribers, helps show ratings growth for Thursday Night Football and the league in general.
Viewers and experts have often bemoaned the quality of the Thursday night games, with reasons like short weeks and players not fully recovered from the previous games oft mentioned. According to football website, ProFootball Talk, the NFL Network has seen two consecutive weeks of ratings growth over the 2016 season, including last week's thrilling shoot-out between the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers, which had 7.4 million viewers.
Twitter has said in the past it averaged around 3.5 million unique viewers per game, a fraction of what games on broadcast TV get. Twitter also let anyone (including those without a Twitter account) watch the games, so the pressure is on Amazon to deliver strong engagement and viewing figures.
Amazon, for its part, is looking to add new features to keep users engaged.
In an email to Fox News, the company said it would offer alternate language audio of the games (including Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, and U.K. English streams, one of which will have well-known soccer announcer Tommy Smyth), its own kickoff show, NFL trivia from Alexa and custom-themed Amazon boxes.
AMAZON'S LACK OF INCOME TAXES PAID HAS BECOME AN 'UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTION'
The league is also mired in controversy as President Donald Trump stirred the proverbial pot last Friday, saying at a rally in Alabama that players who do not stand for the National Anthem should be fired. ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'get that son of a b**** off the field right now - he's fired,'"" Trump said.
Trump has continued to make similar remarks on Twitter, including this one referencing the ratings for the league.
Though the NFL has multi-year, multi-billion dollar deals locked up with cable companies such as CBS, Disney and 21st Century Fox (the parent company of this website), the league is continuing to push towards streaming.
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, one of the most influential owners in the league, said the future for the NFL is over-the-top, a term used to reference non-traditional content such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.
“This year we’re with Amazon and for us the future is OTT,” Kraft said during an interview at the Cannes Lions festival in France in June, as reported by Fox Business. “We’ll be very interested to see how Amazon goes as it’s behind the paywall. The thing we have to be careful of is millennials. They don’t watch TV, they don’t have TVs or subscribe to cable. So we have to bring that audience in. Partly it’s done through fantasy games and linking to that. Over-the-top is a great opportunity.”
According to Bloomberg, the tech giant paid $50 million for the games, with the potential for an additional $30 million in marketing and promotion. By contrast, Twitter, which had the streaming rights to Thursday Night Football in 2016, paid approximately $10 million.
Part of the marketing and promotion is ironically showing up on Twitter, where the hashtag #TNFonPrimeVideo is being promoted by Amazon Video.
TRUMP ATTACKS AMAZON, SAYS IT'S DOING 'GREAT DAMAGE' TO RETAILERS
While it's likely to help show an increase in interest in Amazon's Prime subscription service, it could also help the company's burgeoning advertising business.
Per the agreement with the NFL, Amazon can sell a ""limited number of advertisements"" during the broadcasts, in addition to the ones aired from CBS and NBC. Fox Business reported that the company could charge as much as $2.8 million per 30 second spot.
According to media reports, Barclays estimated Amazon generated around $1.4 billion in advertising revenue in 2016, a figure that pales in comparison to those of both Google and Facebook.
While the deal is an experiment for now (Amazon already airs some NFL-related programming, including ""All or Nothing""), it could be a precursor for viewing rights to come in the future.
A majority of the NFL's rights deals expire in either 2021 or 2022, so companies like Amazon could potentially bid on them when they come up for renewal. If the experiment goes well, analysts could see Kraft's words, that over-the-top is the future, come to fruition.
""As the additional rights come up for renewal, the digital players will definitely be big bidders against the traditional TV companies, and we’ll have to see to what extent the NFL chooses to parcel out streaming and TV rights separately or encourages single bids including both components,"" Dawson said.

"Photos: Disease vs. drugs: How microbes are winning the war
Experts warn that a global health crisis is on the horizon as drugs available for once treatable diseases are losing their edge. The bacteria, viruses and parasites behind diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and gonorrhea are fighting back by developing resistance to our arsenal of pharmaceuticals.
With the World Health Organization saying that we could be heading to a ""post-antibiotic age,"" what infections are becoming a concern?

Malaria (insert: Plasmodium falciparum)
Malaria was a target for global eradication in 1955 using the once potent drug chloroquine as the weapon of choice to kill the plasmodium parasites behind the disease. However, resistance to the drug developed and spread rapidly across the world rendering the drug, and hope of eradication, useless by the 1970s.
A new wave of excitement came soon after with the arrival of artemisinin, which is today prescribed as a combination therapy to avoid the development of resistance. Despite this strategy, resistance has been reported in Cambodia and could once again spread globally. Globalization and increasing travel to remote locations means the 200 million cases of malaria estimated to occur each year are not just a concern for developing countries.

HIV (insert: Human immunodeficiency virus)
The arrival of antiretroviral therapy changed the face of the HIV epidemic globally from a chronic, debilitating and inevitably fatal infection to one that can be managed to live a long and healthier life.
But the virus reproduces rapidly, meaning resistant forms could easily form and multiply. Up to 14% resistance was found in high-income countries soon after antiretrovirals were introduced in the 1990s and increased use of treatment in developing countries has seen resistance emerge more globally. In 2012, 35 million people were estimated to be living with HIV, based on World Health Organization reports, and with over 2 million people newly infected in 2012, HIV could one day return to pandemic levels if resistance continues to spread.

Tuberculosis (insert: mycobacterium tuberculosis)
Tuberculosis almost disappeared in the majority of the Western world as countries developed. But the disease persists globally, with an estimated 8.6 million people developing TB in 2012 and 1.3 million dying from it.
The bacterium behind the disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has developed not only multidrug resistant but also extensively drug resistant forms of the disease, which require an additional pool of more toxic drugs. In 2012, there were 450,000 cases of MDR-TB worldwide and XDR-TB was reported in 92 countries. Countries such as India have reported patients with total resistance to all drugs. With few new drugs in the pipeline to control the bacteria, total resistance could spread.

Typhoid Fever (insert: Salmonella typhi)
Immunization remains the weapon of choice in controlling typhoid fever. The disease still affects 21.5 million people in developing nations, and increased global travel means the disease is not limited to those countries. The United States sees over 5,000 people infected each year after consuming contaminated food and drink abroad.
The bacterium behind the disease, Salmonella typhi, can be killed with various antibiotics, but resistance is now arising to multiple antibiotics and complicating treatment, especially in South Asia, a popular holiday destination.

Hospital acquired Infections (insert: Klebsiella)
Multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which causes a range of symptoms from boils and abscesses to blood poisoning and arthritis, has been a concern for years in hospitals and whilst public health teams have been tackling it, a group of bugs known as the ESKAPE pathogens is taking the lead.
Standing for Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter, the ESKAPE pathogens cause a range of symptoms including pneumonia, urinary-tract infections, septicemia, meningitis and diarrhea. If resistance continues to rise, WHO reports highlight that a routine hospital visit could result in a more serious condition.

Gonorrhea (insert: Neisseria Gonorrhoea)
Globally, there are an estimated 88 million cases of this sexually transmitted infection, caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, each year. Resistance to antibiotics began to occur soon after their introduction in the 1930s and has continued to rise with resistance now seen against five of the drugs once used to treat it -- which include the commonly used antibiotics penicillin and tetracycline.
Only one class of drug, cephalosporins, remains with the ability to fight the bacteria, but resistance to this last resort has now occurred in 10 countries. If this spreads globally, gonorrhea could become untreatable and spread rapidly throughout a promiscuous population.

Influenza (insert: influenza virus)
Influenza virus types A and B sweep through countries annually in the winter months; they cause fever, headaches and muscular pain in most cases, but also cause 3 million to 5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths each year, according to the WHO The antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir are the main means of fighting infection. Preventative antivirals amantadine and rimantadine were once used to control seasonal spread, but high levels of resistance means their use is no longer recommended.
The constantly evolving biology of the influenza virus means that resistance can easily form. Amantadine-resistant viruses began emerging in 2003 and oseltamivir-resistant viruses since 2007. Resistance to zanamivir has also been reported. While the majority of viruses found globally are still sensitive to the key drugs, the resistant forms could easily spread as no other drug options remain available.

"WASHINGTON — Affirming its disdain for ""Obamacare,"" the Trump administration on Thursday announced sharp cuts in programs promoting health care enrollment under the Affordable Care Act for next year.
Advertising will be cut from $100 million spent on 2017 sign-ups to $10 million, said Health and Human Services officials. Funding for consumer helpers called ""navigators"" will also be cut, from $62.5 million for 2017, to $36.8 million for next year.
About 12.2 million people signed up for subsidized private health insurance under former President Barack Obama's signature law this year. The number currently enrolled is estimated to be around 10 million, due to attrition also seen in prior years.
Democrats are likely to accuse the administration of trying to undermine the ACA.
President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have been unable to deliver on their vow to ""repeal and replace"" the 2010 health care law. Trump has repeatedly pronounced the program on the verge of collapse, and has threatened via Twitter to cut off payments to insurers that help reduce consumers' copays and deductibles.
Independent observers say the program has problems, but is not on the verge of collapse. For next year all U. S. counties will have at least one participating insurers, although consumers in a growing number of counties will only have one carrier to pick from.
HHS officials announced the promotional cutbacks in a conference call with reporters. None of the three officials who described the details of the cuts wanted to be identified by name.
The administration says the government hasn't gotten much bang for its buck as far as ACA advertising and the navigator program, with some enrollment centers signing up very few customers.
By comparison, HHS said the combined advertising budget for Medicare Advantage and Medicaid prescription drug plans is $9.7 million.
HHS officials said the 98 navigator programs funded by the ACA enrolled fewer than 82,000 people, or less than 1 percent of the total.
For next year, officials said navigator funding will reflect each sign-up center's prior performance. For example, if a navigator program met 70 percent of its enrollment target, it will get 70 percent of its previous funding. If it only enrolled 30 percent, its funding will be cut to 30 percent. However, every center will get some money from the government, even if it's only a few thousand dollars.
Adding to sign-up challenges, the ACA enrollment season will be considerably shorter for 2018, running from Nov. 1-Dec. 15.",0

"Last October, officials from the Haitian government and a number of foreign governments and institutions, who call themselves“friends of Haiti,” saw their dream become a reality. Finally, there was earthquake reconstruction progress worth celebrating with the inauguration of the giant Caracol Industrial Park (PIC), which, according to its backers, will someday host 20,000 or maybe even 65,000jobs.
President Michel Martelly was there, as were Haitian and foreign diplomats, the Clinton power couple, millionaires and actors, all present to celebrate the government’s clarion call: “Haiti is open for business.”*
“We supported the Caracol Park because we knew it was going to be an extraordinary thing for the north,” then-Social Affairs Minister Josépha Raymond Gauthier toldHaiti Grassroots Watch (HGW). “The park will allow us to ‘decentralize’ the country and create a northern ‘pole.’ It will also give people jobs in an extraordinary way!”
But a two-month investigation by HGW discovered that the number of jobs in the north is not yet “extraordinary,” and that many other promises have not yet been kept.
One year after it started operations, only 1,388 people work in the park; 26 of them are foreigners, and another 24 are security guards. Also, HGW research among a sampling of workers found that, at the end of the day, most have only 57 gourdes, or US$1.36, in hand after paying for transportation and food out of their 200 gourdes minimum wage (US$4.75) salary.
HGW also learned that most of the farmers kicked off the land to make way for the industrial park are still without land.
“Before, Caracol was the breadbasket of the Northeast department,” said Breüs Wilcien, one of the farmers expelled from the 250-hectare zone. “Right now there is a shortage of some products in the local markets. We are just sitting here in misery.”
Another farmer, Waldins Paul, a member of the Association of Caracol Workers, explained: “In my opinion, [the PIC] has its advantages and its disadvantages… The good part is that there are a lot of people who before didn’t have anything to do, who just sat around yawning. But now they see they aren’t getting that much for working, since 200 gourdes (about US$4.75) can’t do anything for anyone. What’s worse, it has impoverished the breadbasket of Haiti’s North and Northeast departments.”
The PIC was put together by the U. S. and Haitian governments with help from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). It cost, for the first phase, at least US$250 million. Almost half, about US$120 million, came from U.S. citizens. Since then, more money has been spent on studies, roads, and on paying off the farmers expelled from their lands. [See“Caracol By The Numbers”]
The January 2010 earthquake forcefully dislocated 1.3 million people in Léogne and the capital. But those weren’t the only regions that saw dislocation. The PIC also forcefully expelled people: the 366 families who were farming 250 hectares of fertile land. [See“Haiti: Open for Business”to learn more about the choice of Caracol for the park.] The Chabert plantation assured the survival of about 2,500 people in those families, as well as 750 agricultural workers who toiled for at least 100 days per year each year on the plots.
The Haitian government requisitioned the land in November 2011, covered it with asphalt and fill, and put up giant hangers for the factories. The Technical and Execution Unit (Unité Technique d’Exécution– UTE), an agency of the Finance Ministry, has been charged with the task of relocating of the farmers, and also with paying them damages to cover the cost of every harvest lost until they receive new lands.
According to the UTE, each farmer is getting US$1,450 per hectare to make up for the lost cash revenue, as well as an additional US$1,000 per hectare to account for the food that the family would have eaten from its own plot(s). (HGW could not determine if the agricultural workers also received payments.)
In January 2013, the UTE told HGW that the state had paid out to the farmers on two occasions, because the farmers had lost two harvests thus far.
In addition to the money spent to reimburse the farmers – a total of about US$1.2 million, Haiti has also twice lost 1,400 metric tons (MT) of agricultural products, or 2,800 MT of food produced in Haiti for Haitian consumption. It takes over 100,000 bushels of dried beans to make up 2,800 MT. Finally, the UTE itself has an operating budget of about US$1 million. [SeeCaracol By The Numbers]
Verly Davilmar will be getting 35,000 gourdes, or about US$833, for the most recent harvest lost. Before, he worked a half-hectare of land, growing yams, manioc and spinach. No longer. No land. He sits at home. A family of 10.
“What they gave me is gone in a flash,” he told HGW. “There’s no other revenue. You don’t have any land so you have to make do with nothing.”
UTE Director Michael Delandsheer told HGW that his team has almost found a solution. The farmers will eventually get plots nearby, in Glaudine.
“Our first priority is to give the farmers land so they can work,” Delandsheer explained. “But even then, once they have land, we aren’t finished. We are going to make sure they get official leases to their land from the tax office, and we are going to accompany them throughout the process. Even then, our work isn’t done. We want to continue to accompany them, to help them improve their productivity.”
After almost two years of promises, the Caracol farmers remain skeptical. Some of the farmers in the Ouanaminthe area, home to the CODEVI industrial park, never got lands they were promised after being displaced almost a decade ago.
Caracol farmers were also allegedly promised jobs. “They said our family would be able to work [at the PIC], but so far we haven’t gotten any job offers,” Davilmar said.
The assistant mayor of Caracol is also disappointed. At the beginning, Vilsaint Joseph was not completely supportive of the park, but he kept an open mind, he said. And he is happy that the commune now has electricity, thanks to the power plant built by the U. S.. But people in Caracol haven’t gotten jobs.
“There are people who are about 32 years old, who went and got training, but they didn’t get a job because of the flood of young people in their twenties,” the mayor lamented. “I think that isn’t right. People spent three months getting trained up but then were told – ‘no work for you.’”
The decline in regional agricultural production is also a worry, he said, because before, “come harvest time, there would be truckloads of corn and beans for Port-au-Prince.”
Of a dozen farming families questioned by HGW, all of them said the payments were insufficient. Some said they could not afford to send all of their children to school.
“We are thinking of organizing a sit-in to demand that the authorities give us land so we can work,” Breüs Wilcien told HGW during a recent telephone interview.
Wilcien got 42,000 gourdes (US$1,000) but he said he can’t pay for his children’s schooling.
“My entire household is suffering,” he said. “Before, we always had our manioc field. When things were going badly, we went out there and pulled some up to make sweet bread or to just eat as is. We are really suffering these days.”
If the farmers and their families can be considered as “losers,” at least for the moment, the government and its partners say that those who got jobs are “winners” because they have employment. All of the documents concerning Haiti’s reconstruction talk about the need to “create” jobs and in this regard, the PIC is held up as the biggest “success” thus far.
HGW interviewed 15 workers, men and women, employed at the South Korean factory employing most of the PIC’s workers. This assembly factory – S & H Global – is a subsidiary of SAE-A Trading. It puts together clothing for some of the biggest U. S.-based companies, including JC Penny and WalMart.
All of the workers – most of them women, as in assembly factories the world over – confirmed that they received the minimum wage of 200 gourdes (US$4.75) per day. Among the workers questioned, 11 said that they spent on average 61 gourdes on transportation each day, and another 82 gourdes on the midday meal and a drink. That left only 57 gourdes or about US$1.36, for all the additional expenses: water, electricity, food for the family, clothing, school fees, etc. [See“Haiti: Open for Business”]
“I can’t live on this salary. It doesn’t do anything for me,” Annette** told HGW.
Before the PIC, this mother of 10 worked at the CODEVI industrial park in Ouanaminthe. She lives near the border town and gets up early every day to come to the PIC. Annette left her job for the new position in the hope that conditions would be better, she said. She was wrong.
“What I found is not worth if,” she explained, but she doesn’t know what else to do. Annette is in the same position as the thousands of Haitians who agree to work for a 200-gourde daily salary.
Economist Frédérick Gérald Chéry believes that the Haitian government has a flawed approach to the minimum wage question, and that it has made a huge error in focusing on assembly factories where workers rarely earn more than that. In addition to not providing enough income for even a basic existence, the State University professor notes that a 200-gourde salary cannot contribute to the growth of other sectors of Haiti’s economy.
“You have to calculate what a worker earns and then what he can buy with that money,” Chéry told HGW during a November 2012 interview. “What he can buy is the most important factor. You should not set the minimum wage according to absolute terms, but in terms of the basic necessities. You should not encourage a worker to buy rice that comes from the U. S. or the Dominican Republic. A minimum wage should be able to buy local products.”
Waiting for a bus to go back home to Cap Hatien, Flora* was overjoyed to talk to a journalist, despite clearly being exhausted.
“God sent you,” she said. “I have been needing a journalist to talk about what we are putting up with in the park. They yell at us as if we were animals. The food they prepare is bad. There is only warm water to drink. Sometimes I’ve had to work all day without a face-mask. Dust fills my nose.”
The workers’ comments were backed up by arecent reportfrom “Better Work,” an agency of the UN’s International Labor Organization, which found that half of the 22 assembly factories in the capital region were “in non-compliance” as far as working conditions were concerned, and that 16 of them did not have an “acceptable” temperature.
Asked about salaries and working conditions at its Caracol factory, a representative of SAE-A contacted via email said the company respected all aspects of Haitian law. However, when HGW asked to visit the factory in order to see the working conditions, the request was denied. More recently, a union organizer also asked to visit the factory in order to see working conditions. That request was also denied.
HGW’s investigation revealed that of the 15 S & H Global workers questioned, 80% said they felt the salary level vs. the amount worked did not make sense.
“It’s not worth it!” Adeline* said. “The supervisors don’t respect us. They don’t see us as human beings. They hit us with pieces of cloth.”
Formerly a merchant, Adeline said she wants to go back to her old profession rather than continue to suffer.
Haiti’s former Social Affairs Minister told HGW that she realizes the minimum wage offers a low salary. But she immediately echoed the same justifications that all the factory owners and managers repeat.
“Someone working in an assembly industry [factory] isn’t going to get rich overnight,” ex-Minister Josépha Raymond Gauthier said in a November 2012 interview. “But someone who has no job at all has no hope.”
The Caracol mayor told HGW that he felt the same way last year. Now that he knows more about what he called “unacceptable” conditions and the low salary, he has changed his mind. The jobs are nothing short of “humiliation,” Vilsaint Joseph said.
The Haitian government has said that eventually it will provide free bus transportation to workers and has also promised that some of them will receive housing with subsidized mortgages. Part of the US$120 million pledged by the U. S. government is for a US$31 million development of 1,500 small homes called “EKAM” and located near the PIC. According to U.S. and IDB documents, the houses – costing US$23,510 each–will be for workers as well as displaced Caracol families considered “vulnerable” because they are headed by a woman or an elderly person.
However, because only 750 are funded at the moment, relatively few will benefit. [See alsoCaracol by the Numbers]
In all, for the installation of the park, the power station, EKAM, the payments to the farmers, and other expenses, the U. S. government, the IDB and the Haitian government have spent over US$250 million. But even with that investment, the eventual benefits to Haiti and to the Haitian state are not guaranteed.
All of the companies that set up shop in the PIC will get various tax breaks, meaning that little money will end up in the state coffers. Until the year 2020, the clothing assembly companies, like S & H Global, have additional privileges thanks to the U. S. “HELP” (Haiti Economic Lift Program) law. [See“Haiti: Open for Business”]
S & H Global does employ 1,388 people and has promised to employ another 1,300 by the end of the year. In addition, SAE-A is building a school and will subsidize its operation.
But to establish those jobs, SAE-A closed down a Guatemala factory, throwing 1,200 workers on the street. The company left Guatemala for Haiti because of Haiti’s low salaries and because of the HELP law, according toPrensa Libre. Once the HELP advantages expire in seven years, will SAE-A also leave Haiti?
Even with these meager results, the Haitian government and other actors say the PIC is a good “bet.” In one document, the IDBpromisesthat it will set Haiti on “the path of economic growth.”
Speaking to theNew York Timesin 2012, the IDB’s country manager José Agustín Aguerre recognized that “[c]reating an exclusively garment maquiladora zone is something everyone — I wouldn’t say tries to avoid, but considers a last resort.” Still, he said, the PIC is “a good opportunity” even though the salaries are “low” and the jobs “unstable.”
“[Y]es, maybe tomorrow there will a better opportunity for firms elsewhere and they will just leave,” Aguerre added. “But everyone thought this was a risk worth taking.”
Economist Frédérick Gérald Chéry has a completely different analysis. Chéry notes that rushing to set up assembly industries, without a global plan, and without a national debate, is an error.
“Rather than seeing the textile industry as a temporary thing, they see it as a contributing sector to our economy, and it cannot be that, because the salaries are too low and because we don’t produce any of the inputs,” Chéry told HGW. “We don’t produce the cloth, we don’t do the design, and we don’t have an ‘economy of scale.’ I predict a catastrophe if we stay on this path.”
Also, the economist noted, prioritizing the PIC over agricultural production is very worrying. “If we don’t develop our agriculture in parallel with the clothing assembly industry, the farmers will be the losers,” he said.
The Caracol Industrial Park is not the first big project full of promises to set up shop in Haiti’s north. In 1927, U. S. capitalists established the Dauphin Plantation to grow sisal for the international market. By World War II, the plantation had taken over 10,000 hectares of land and was the biggest employer in the country. But tens of thousands of farmers lost their land to make way for the monoculture, and the entire region became dependent on the industry.
After the war and the invention of nylon, sisal’s price plummeted. The investors pulled out and eventually – in the 1980s – the plantation closed, bankrupt. Its traces can be seen today: ruined buildings and land made less fertile by years of sisal plants.
One of the Caracol farmers remembered the plantation. He knows what happened when the industry closed down. “Today, if you go visit Derac, Collette, and Phaeton, you’ll see,” he said. “If it weren’t for the UN blue helmets and the World Food Organization, those people would have died of hunger by now.”

"J. J. Watt, star of the NFL’s Houston Texans, has raised more than$10 million for Tropical StormHarvey victims in Houston in just days, and the numberscontinue to climb.
Watt began the fundraiser on YouCaring.comSundaywith the intended goal of $1 million dollars. In a video on Twitter, Watt said it was tough to watch his city suffer and not do anything about it, so he began the fundraiser in an effort to help his fellow Houstonians.
Recovery efforts from Hurricane Harvey will be massive.
We must come together to help rebuild our communities.https://t.co/SR6DmnNbyM pic.twitter.com/iiMsG2i4dl
The fundraiser quickly took off, and each subsequentday, Watt raised the fundraising goal to greater and greater sums.
By Tuesday, Watt had raised $2 million dollars for Houstonians, but much more money was to flow into the fundraiserthat day.
Owner of the NFL’s Tennessee Titans — a Houston Texans rival —Amy Adams Strunk, donated $1 million to Watt’s cause, putting the sum over $3 million.
Watt made the announcement via Twitter that the fundraiser had hit $3.25 million, thanked donors, and set the new goal at $4 million.
Before the day was over, Watt announced that the $4 million goal was met. The Houston Texanraised it to $5 million.
By Wednesday, Watt had hit a $6 million goal, and announced on Twitter that he was raising the new goal to $10 million.
In a Twitter video, Watt explained his plan on how he was going to use the money, including purchasing water, food, and cleaning supplies, and loading them into donated semi-trucks. Watt said he and his fellow teammates would set up distribution points around the affected areas in order to get these supplies directly to the people.
The donations to Watt’s page went into full gear that day, however. During her show, Ellen DeGeneres interviewed Watt live about his fundraiser. At the end of the interview, DeGeneres said she and Walmart had teamed up, and donated $1 million for Houston victims.
After DeGeneres’s show, the donations to Watt’s pagebegan to fly in quickly.
In fact, the donations camein so quickly that YouCaring.com began experiencing server issues. YouCaring CEO Dan Saper left a message on Watt’s donation page notifying everyone that the company was working hard to ensure the site can keep up with the traffic.
“The response here has been surreal,” Saper wrote. “Due to everyone’s overwhelming generosity and the amount of traffic going to this page, you may experience intermittent donation issues. Please bear with us, or check back in a few minutes if that’s happening to you. Our engineering team is working tirelessly to ensure uptime on the site!”
As of this writing, the donations have surpassed $10.6 million, with more than100,000 donors, and the numbers are continuing to climb. Watt left another update video on his Twitter page thanking everyone for their donations. Watt addedthat the semi-trucks were already being filled up with everything from baby supplies, to generators.

Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi demanded Thursday that Kurdish leaders cancel the results of its independence referendum
Dillon said the situation has had a negative impact on operations against ISIS
(CNN)Armed clashes between Iraqi and Kurdish forces in Northern Iraq are undermining the fight against ISIS, even as Iraqi troops launch an operation to capture what the US-led military coalition has called the terror group's ""final stronghold"" in Iraq.
A spokesman for the US-led coalition, US Army Col. Ryan Dillon, told CNN Thursday that the coalition was ""aware of tensions and actions among Iraqi Security Forces, Popular Mobilization Forces and Peshmerga units in Iraq's Kurdish Region.""
He said that the number of clashes between Kurdish and Iraqi security forces in recent days had remained steady despite the Kurdistan Regional Government's recent offer to ""freeze"" the results of the September referendum on independence, a vote that was opposed by the coalition.
Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi demanded Thursday that Kurdish leaders cancel the results of its independence referendum, rejecting a proposal from the semi-autonomous region to ""freeze"" the outcome instead and begin talks over the future of the region.
Tillerson makes surprise visit to Iraq following ISIS defeats
Dillon said the situation has had a negative impact on operations against ISIS, impeding the coalition's ability to transfer arms and equipment to its allies in Syria and Iraq as it seeks to oust ISIS from its last bastions of control in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, which connects Iraq and Syria.

""These events have negatively impacted coalition efforts to defeat ISIS, specifically the inability to move military equipment and supplies to our partners both in Iraq and Syria,"" Dillon said.
It has also forced the coalition to divert intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets to monitor the situation between Iraqi and Kurdish forces. These ""ISR"" assets, which can include drone aircraft, are therefore not being used to identify ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria.
Iraqi forces clash with Kurdish fighters in town north of Kirkuk
The coalition believes that the terror group's ""final stronghold"" in Iraq, al Qaim and Rawa, contains about 1,500 to 2,500 ISIS defenders. The operation to recapture the area was confirmed by the coalition in a statement Thursday.
The US military assesses that there are also approximately 3,000 ISIS fighters just across the border in Abu Kamal, Syria and there are concerns that those operatives could be used as a ""reserve"" in the battle for al Qaim.
Raqqa: US-backed forces declare 'total liberation' of ISIS stronghold
The coalition also believes that much of the surviving ISIS leadership has left Mayadin, Syria in the wake of its capture by Russian backed pro-regime forces and have now relocated to Abu Kamal.
ISIS has faced multiple defeats in Iraq in the wake of the recapture of Mosul.
The ""massive amount of resources and effort"" ISIS put into defending Mosul and Raqqa largely sapped the terror organization of its ability to mount robust defenses elsewhere in Iraq,"" US Army Col. Pat Work, who led advisers in Iraq, told reporters earlier this month.

"A top US commander has warned of an imminent war with Russia and has called on thousands of troops to be ready for redeployment towards the Russian border.
General Robert Neller, the commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Norway, announced the ‘imminent war’ on Thursday, pointing to a shift of focus on conflicts in the Middle East to Russia and the Pacific region.
“I hope I’m wrong, but there’s a war coming,” Neller told the US forces during a visit to the Nordic country. “You’re in a fight here, an informational fight, a political fight, by your presence.”
Presstv.com reports:The top commander referred to Russia and the Pacific as the next major areas of conflict, predicting a “big-a** fight” in the future.
“I think probably the focus, the intended focus is not on the Middle East,” Neller said, when asked by a Marine about where the force saw itself fighting in the future. “The focus is more on the Pacific and Russia.”
While the Marine Corps commander admitted that the US troops would remain in the Middle East for some time to come, he pointed to “a slight pullback” from that region and a reorientation toward Russia and the Pacific.
“Just remember why you’re here,” he added. “They’re watching. Just like you watch them, they watch you. We’ve got 300 Marines up here; we could go from 300 to 3,000 overnight. We could raise the bar.”
The comments were made amid tensions between Russia and NATO allies, with Moscow warning Oslo that the presence of American troops could hurt relations after the Nordic country decided to host a new unit of US soldiers through the end of 2018.
The deployment will strain already tense relations with Russia, as it goes against a vow made by Norway not to allow the deployment of foreign combat forces on its soil unless the country was under the threat of attack or for military drills.
Russia and NATO have had strained ties since conflict erupted in eastern Ukraine some three years ago. More than 10,000 have been killed in the war in Ukraine’s industrial east, where the Kiev government is fighting pro-Russia forces.
Russia has long been wary of NATO’s expansion eastward — toward Russia’s western borders. NATO has deployed around 4,000 troops, consisting of four battle groups, to Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland in recent years.
The US is also engaged in joint military drills mainly with South Korea and Japan in the Pacific region, as a show of force against North Korea in response to Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missiles program.
North Korea, already concerned by the US’s permanent and heavy military presence in the region, has described the the drills as a “provocation.”",1
"(Before It's News)The first trees to have ever grown on Earth were also the most complex, new research has revealed.
Fossils from a 374-million-year-old tree found in north-west China have revealed an interconnected web of woody strands within the trunk of the tree that is much more intricate than that of the trees we see around us today.
The strands, known as xylem, are responsible for conducting water from a tree’s roots to its branches and leaves. In the most familiar trees the xylem forms a single cylinder to which new growth is added in rings year by year just under the bark. In other trees, notably palms, xylem is formed in strands embedded in softer tissues throughout the trunk. This is an illustrative transverse plane through the small trunk, showing the three naturally-fractured parts.
Credit:Xu and Berry, 2017.
Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the scientists have shown that the earliest trees, belonging to a group known as the cladoxlopsids, had their xylem dispersed in strands in the outer 5 cm of the tree trunk only, whilst the middle of the trunk was completely hollow.
The narrow strands were arranged in an organised fashion and were interconnected to each other like a finely tuned network of water pipes.
The team, which includes researchers from Cardiff University, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, and State University of New York, also show that the development of these strands allowed the tree’s overall growth.
Rather than the tree laying down one growth ring under the bark every year, each of the hundreds of individual strands were growing their own rings, like a large collection of mini trees.
As the strands got bigger, and the volume of soft tissues between the strands increased, the diameter of the tree trunk expanded. The new discovery shows conclusively that the connections between each of the strands would split apart in a curiously controlled and self-repairing way to accommodate the growth.
At the very bottom of the tree there was also a peculiar mechanism at play – as the tree’s diameter expanded the woody strands rolled out from the side of the trunk at the base of the tree, forming the characteristic flat base and bulbous shape synonymous with the cladoxylopsids.
Co-author of the study Dr Chris Berry, from Cardiff University’s School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, said: “There is no other tree that I know of in the history of the Earth that has ever done anything as complicated as this. The tree simultaneously ripped its skeleton apart and collapsed under its own weight while staying alive and growing upwards and outwards to become the dominant plant of its day.
“By studying these extremely rare fossils, we’ve gained an unprecedented insight into the anatomy of our earliest trees and the complex growth mechanisms that they employed.
“This raises a provoking question: why are the very oldest trees the most complicated?”
Dr Berry has been studying cladoxylopsids for nearly 30 years, uncovering fragmentary fossils from all over the world. He’s previously helped uncovered a previously mythical fossil forest in Gilboa, New York, where cladoxylopsid trees grew over 385 million years ago.
Yet Dr Berry was amazed when a colleague uncovered a massive, well-preserved fossil of a cladoxylopsid tree trunk in Xinjiang, north-west China.
“Previous examples of these trees have filled with sand when fossilised, offering only tantalising clues about their anatomy. The fossilised trunk obtained from Xinjiang was huge and perfectly preserved in glassy silica as a result of volcanic sediments, allowing us to observe every single cell of the plant,” Dr Berry continued.
The overall aim of Dr Berry’s research is to understand how much carbon these trees were capable of capturing from the atmosphere and how this effected the Earth’s climate.",1
"Battle for influence in Asia
Singapore caught between US, China
South China Sea: Vietnam takes up fight
China unstoppable in South China Sea?
China's new world order
Tensions have ratcheted up as China has reclaimed land in massive dredging operations, turning sandbars into islands equipped with airfields, ports and lighthouses.
Beijing has also warned US warships and military aircraft to stay away from these islands.
China claims almost all of the South China Sea, and has heavily militarized some islands in the region and expanded other territories with major land reclamation work, turning sandbars into islands and equipping them with airfields, ports and weapons systems.
All or parts of the sea are also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam, which has led to intense territorial disputes and naval standoffs.
Top US and Chinese military commanders signed a deal in August to improve communications between the two forces amid ongoing disputes in the South and East China seas -- a move intended to reduce the chances of ""miscalculation.""
That agreement was signed after a US destroyer sailed near a man-made island constructed by China as part of another ""freedom of navigation"" operation meant to challenge Beijing's territorial claims.
Showdown in the South China Sea: How did we get here?
The Chinese Defense Ministry denounced the operation as a ""provocation"" and said it was ""firmly opposed to such flaunting of force and promotion of militarization in the region by the US, which could easily trigger accidents at sea and in the air.""
In July, the guided-missile destroyer USS Stethem conducted a ""freedom of navigation exercise"" around Triton Island in the Paracel archipelago, which is claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan.
China called that action ""a serious political and military provocation.""
The US ""stirs up trouble"" and runs ""in the opposite direction from countries in the region who aspire for stability, cooperation and development,"" a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at the time.",0
"Google, Reddit, Snap — what do these companies have in common?
Aside from being wildly successful, they were all co-founded by enterprising college students who were friends before they were business partners. While success can be sweet, the road can be rocky, both for the business and the personal relationship. It’s an added stress for student entrepreneurs who are trying to balance school, family and their business, which typically becomes the No. 1 priority.
We spoke to some entrepreneurs about how they’ve been able to successfully nurture their businesses and their friendships. Here's what they had to say:
Friends often have similar personalities, but you want your business partners to have different strengths so that you’re stronger together. “If you’re good at sales, maybe you find a partner who’s good at financials,” said Scott Issen, CEO of Future Founders, a Chicago-based nonprofit that supports young entrepreneurs and connects them with mentors. “That also helps partners develop clearly defined roles.”
Beatrice Fischel-Bock, 25, who co-founded design app Hutch with two of her fellow students at George Washington University, says this was key for their company, which has since raised over $7 million in funding.
""At first, we did everything together — and we quickly realized that was a bad way to get stuff done; we had to divide and conquer,” she recalled.
“A saving grace for us is that we have very different strengths and weaknesses, so we were able to complement each other well. It was always clear who would tackle what. We’ve seen friends who are too similar and ownership becomes blurry, resulting in issues.”
""Many students start their businesses as a school project or entry into a pitch competition, but once they start seeing success they’re not on the same page about what comes next,” explained Issen. Entrepreneurs who’ve been able to maintain friendships with their partners suggest putting a partnership agreement in place as soon as possible.
“We entered into a partnership agreement very early on — our parents and advisors all told us that one of the first things we had to do was get our LLC partnership figured out,” said Fischel-Bock.
Dan Soviero, 22, founded Signature Lacrosse out of his University of Tampa dorm room, and convinced a high school lacrosse teammate and friend, Nick Martin, to transfer from the University of Delaware and join him selling customizable lacrosse balls. The duo has seen enormous growth, with nine employees and $1.5 million in sales over the last year. Through all that, they still finish each other’s sentences and have a tight bond. “We clearly have agreements in place,” said Soviero. “We set clear expectations, and are very transparent in our communication with each other. If you do that from the very beginning, then if anything happens, you can just refer back.”
Soviero and Martin decided off the bat that money was not their goal; instead, both wanted to use their company as a vehicle to foster leaders and create a chain reaction whereby those leaders inspire leadership in others. “We spent hours and hours in high-intensity conversations on this topic — the business’ success doesn’t scratch the surface of what we can accomplish,” said Soviero. “Nick and I knew we could just sell lacrosse balls and we could walk away with $1.5 to $2 million a year, but that’s not what we wanted out of our lives. We sacrificed that to challenge each other further. We shot ourselves in the foot to make a better play.”
Soviero and Martin both dropped out of school to focus on Signature Lacrosse (though both say they intend to finish school in the future). It’s good to know well before that point whether partners are willing to make that kind of sacrifice, and what milestones the business needs to hit, be it revenue or otherwise, Issen advised.
No matter how smooth things are at the beginning, or how close you are as friends, there are bound to be times when you disagree and things get heated. Figuring out the rules of engagement ahead of time will help prevent those disagreements from getting personal.“We decided that if we’re at a point where there’s no consensus, and we’re just going in circles, we’d have a two-to-one vote; If two of us agreed on something, the other one had to accept it,” said Fischel-Bock. “Making this formal early on took the heat off our personal lives.”
The most important rule is to “be a good guy,” Martin said, with Soviero adding, “There’s a big element of not being a dirt bag.”
Getting a business off the ground means sacrificing other extracurriculars and even sleep. And while partners often work around the clock, taking it out of the office can be a boon to the friendship.
“You’re married to your business, you’re married to your business partner,” said Danish Dhamani, 22, who co-founded Orai, an app to aid in public speaking, with friend Paritosh Gupta at Drexel University. “If you can’t do basic friend stuff together, you can’t go into business. We do all kinds of activities together — camping, canoeing, wall climbing, you name it.”
Fischel-Bock agreed. ""We try to plan a day together at the beach or by the pool.” She said. “When we hang out outside of work, we have a strict no work-talk rule. It reminds us why we are friends and keeps things separate.”
For Soviero and Martin, there is no separation. Even the gym turns into an office. “We go to the gym every night, get pumped, get a steam in, but even that time is spent discussing the business,” said Soviero, with Martin adding, “Even though it seems like downtime, there’s nothing that Dan and I do that isn’t focused on moving forward.”",0
"The USS Michigan a guided-missile submarine — is expected to make a visible port call in South Korea on Tuesday, according to a US defense official.
The official described the move as a show of force amid tensions between the US and North Korea.
The US Navy submarine is expected to dock in the port city of Busan, South Korea, on the same day that North Korea celebrates the 85th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People’s Army.
A port call involves stopping at a foreign port for supplies, repairs or transshipment of cargo.
The USS Michigan’s stop in South Korea was first reported by South Korean newspaper Dong-A Ilbo.
While the USS Michigan is not expected to take part in the joint exercises, its presence in the region is meant to send a strong message to Pyongyang.
US President Donald Trump told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo earlier this month that the US was sending an “armada” with submarines to the region.
“We are sending an armada. Very powerful,” Trump told Bartiromo. “We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier. That I can tell you.”
Analysts at the time suspected Trump might be referring to Ohio-class subs like the Michigan.
Armed with tactical missiles and equipped with superior communications capabilities, the Michigan is one of four US Navy subs that began service as a ballistic missile submarine, loaded with nuclear missiles as part of the US strategic nuclear deterrent.
In the 2000s the Navy converted four of the Ohio-class subs into land-attack platforms armed with conventional weapons.
Each of the four submarines can carry up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles. They are also outfitted to stealthily deploy up to 66 special operations forces and their equipment.
The Michigan could be deployed in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, off the Korean Peninsula, said Carl Schuster, a Hawaii Pacific University professor and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.
“Nuclear submarines prefer to operate in water over 100 fathoms deep (600 feet). Not always possible but they like having a lot of vertical space to duck and dodge in if they encounter anything unpleasant.
The 560-foot-long Michigan is one of four converted Ohio-class subs, joining the USS Ohio, USS Florida and USS Georgia.
The Michigan’s visit to Busan comes after North Korea on Sunday threatened to sink the American aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, which is beginning joint drills with two Japanese destroyers in the western Pacific Ocean.
The Vinson will be joined by the Ashigara and Samidare destroyers in “tactical training” drills near the Philippines, the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force said.
North Korea’s state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in an editorial the country is ready to illustrate its “military force” by sinking a “nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a single strike.”
The North Korean state newspaper claimed to have weaponry that “can reach continental US and Asia Pacific region” and the “absolute weapon,” or a nuclear hydrogen bomb.",1
"The US-led coalition is competing with the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) in a race to reach and liberate Raqqa from ISIS.
Should the SAA fail to liberate Raqqa from the terrorists then Syria could be permanently broken up, with the help of a U. S. led coalition that includes Kurdish, Turkish, Saudi and westernagendas.
Over the last few days, the 555th Brigade ofthe Syrian Arab Army’s 4th Mechanized Division, backed bypro-government militias, has continued togain ground innortheast Syria. It has moved towardthe Al-Raqqa Governorate’s strategic Tabaqa Military Airport.
On Friday, Syrian armed forces re-entered the governorate forthe first time sinceAugust 2014. Back in2014, Tabaqa Military Airport was seized byDaesh (ISIS/ISIL) and turned intothe terrorists’ primary military base and training ground inSyria, according tothe independent news source Arab al-Masdar.
“With the Khanasser-Ithriyah Road free ofany ISIS [Daesh] presence, the Syrian Armed Forces can continue toconcentrate their soldiers atthe Raqqa-Hama axis withouthaving tofear another disruption alongtheir primary supply route toAleppo,” Al-Masdar News reports.
Raqqa and a number ofother east Syrian cities alongthe Euphrates still remain underDaesh control. Both Damascus and the US-led coalition consider defeating the terrorist group their primary goal.
However, the issue should be seen in a “larger context,” the blog Moon of Alabama suggests.
“Could the US and its allies capture Raqqa or Deir ez-Zor and withit parts ofeastern Syria? It could use them asa bargaining chip togain some negotiation power withSyria and its allies overthe future ofSyria,” the blogger writes.
On the other hand, the US-led coalition may create a Sunni state innortheast Syria and western Iraq, asAmb. John Bolton proposed inhis November analysis forthe New York Times.
“Rather thanstriving torecreate the post-World War I map, Washington should recognize the new geopolitics. The best alternative tothe Islamic State innortheastern Syria and western Iraq is a new, independent Sunni state,” Bolton elaborated.
It is not the first time the plan has emerged. In September 2013 a very similar vision was voiced byAmerican veteran foreign-affairs reporter Robin Wright. And beforethat, in2006 Army Lt. Col. (ret.) Ralph Peters presented his concept onhow toreshape the Middle East.
The blogger suggests that Mosul may become part ofa new “Sunni state” that would be put underAnkara’s tutelage.
There are clear signs indicating that the US-led coalition could have been preparing for advance innortheast Syria.
The Pentagon has recently expanded the Rmeilan airbase inSyria’s northern province ofHasakah; American helicopters were spotted using the base byindependent observers onthe ground.
The information has been confirmed by geopolitical intelligence firm Stratfor, which provided satellite imagery of the Rmeilan airfield. Furthermore, it is known that the US Special Ops have been deployed in Syria.
On Friday US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter met with his counterpart from the United Arab Emirates in Brussels. After the meeting, Carter said that the UAE had agreed to deploy its special forces troops in Syria to assist Sunni Arab fighters on the ground to capture Raqqa, the Associated Press reported.

The news is especially interesting inlight ofthe recent Saudi vow tolaunch a ground operation inSyria withUS backing.
At the same time, inmid-January, Ash Carter announced the US 101st Airborne Division would be deployed inIraq toadvise and assist Iraqi armed forces foran attack onMosul.
“The Saudis would deploy fromSaudi Arabia, likely viaa US controlled airstrip inwestern Iraq towardsSyria, while the brigade fromthe 101st would probably deploy fromthe Kurdish area innorth Iraq throughthe Kurdish areas innorth-east Syria towardsRaqqa. Raqqa would thereby be attacked froma north-eastern and a south-eastern,” Moon ofAlabama suggests, adding that the airport ofRmeilan would be one ofthe major bases.
Currently Damascus’ major objective is topreserve the unity and sovereignty ofSyria. The loss ofRaqqa would mean a devastating loss ofthe country’s eastern oil fields.
Moreover, a new advance ofthe US-led coalition inSyria may trigger a new wave ofviolence inthe region and result ina long and wider war.
“A ground operation would involve all participants ina war. Therefore, the Americans and our Arab partners must consider well whether they want a permanent war. They are wrong if they think they could win this war quickly, especially inthe Arab world where everybody fights againsteverybody,” Russian Prime Minister Medvedev stressed inan interview withGermany’s Handelsblatt newspaper Thursday.",1

A fascination with flight
John Herschel Glenn Jr. made history in 1962 when he completed a three-orbit flight in a cramped space capsule dubbed Friendship 7. He later served for nearly a quarter century as a US senator. In 1998, he returned to space at age 77, becoming the oldest person to ever do so.
Born in the small eastern Ohio town of Cambridge on July 18, 1921, Glenn recounted an idyllic childhood where ""patriotism filled the air.""

""Love of country was a given. Defense of its ideals was an obligation,"" Glenn wrote in his memoir. ""The opportunity to join in its quests and explorations was a challenge not only to fulfill a sacred duty but to join a joyous adventure.""
Glenn developed a fascination with flying at an early age. When he was 8 years old, he and his father went for a ride in an open-cockpit biplane, two years after Charles Lindbergh made his transatlantic flight. That adventure sealed his destiny as a pilot.
He also developed an early love for childhood playmate Anna Margaret Castor. By the time they got to high school, they were sweethearts. Both were in Muskingum College in New Concord, his mother's alma mater, when Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. A short time later, Glenn enrolled in the Naval Aviation Cadet Program and graduated the following March. He joined the Marine Corps in early 1943 and wed his childhood sweetheart on April 6 of that year.
John Glenn's true hero
Glenn flew 149 combat missions in World War II and the Korean War. In the final nine days of the Korean War, Glenn shot down three MiG fighter jets along the Yalu River. His military service earned him numerous awards, including six Distinguished Flying Crosses.
After Korea, Glenn became a test pilot for naval and Marine aircraft and, in 1957, set the transcontinental air speed record. He flew a Vought F-8 Crusader from Los Angeles to New York in three hours and 23 minutes -- the first transcontinental flight to average supersonic speed.
With that feat, Glenn became known as one of the top test pilots in the United States and a natural candidate for the country's emerging space program.
People we've lost in 2016
'The Right Stuff'
He eagerly volunteered when NASA requested pilots for its suborbital and orbital programs, and in 1959 he and six others -- Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, Scott Carpenter, Wally Schirra, Gordon Cooper and Deke Slayton -- were selected as the first astronauts, known as the ""Mercury 7."" Glenn was the last living member of the group.
The men instantly became national heroes and media sensations.
On February 20, 1962, Glenn rode an Atlas rocket into history as the first American to orbit the Earth. He was the third American in space, behind Shepard and Grissom -- whose missions aboard smaller Redstone rockets were short suborbital flights. The Soviet Union by that time had sent two cosmonauts, Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov, on orbital flights.
After making three orbits in four hours and 55 minutes, Glenn landed in the waters off Grand Turk Island in the Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles southeast of Bermuda, where he and his Friendship 7 were retrieved by the destroyer USS Noa.

— Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) December 8, 2016
Glenn recalled in a Life magazine article a strange phenomenon that occurred during the mission: ""There, spread out as far as I could see were literally thousands of tiny luminous objects that glowed in the black sky like fireflies. I was riding slowly through them, and the sensation was like walking backwards through a pasture where someone had waved a wand and made all the fireflies stop right where they were and glow steadily.""
The flight also featured a glitch that contributed to Glenn's reputation for being cool under fire.
Because of an indicator light showing that the Mercury capsule's heat shield was partly detached, mission controllers decided to bring Glenn home early and told him not to jettison his aft retro rockets, which allowed him to maneuver the craft in space. Because the retropack was strapped to the heat shield, it was thought it would provide an extra measure of security.
It would later be learned that the heat shield wasn't damaged, but the fiery re-entry was made more spectacular by the scorching retropack in Earth's upper atmosphere. Glenn's first words when he stepped aboard the deck of the USS Noa were, ""Boy, that was a real fireball of a ride!""
Later in life, Glenn poked fun at the risk.
""We used to joke about it in the past when people would say, 'What do you think on the launch pad?' "" he said in a 1998 CNN interview.
""And the standard answer was, 'How do you think you'd feel if you knew you were on top of 2 million parts built by the lowest bidder on a government contract?' ""
Glenn's mission was more than just a round-the-world space journey. It was a psychological boost to a nation worried about the Soviet Union's early lead in the space race.
Shortly after landing, Glenn was honored with an enormous ticker tape parade in New York City on March 1, 1962. An estimated 4 million people turned out.
His success bolstered America's spirit and gave credence to President John Kennedy's 1961 pledge to put men on the moon. But Glenn would not be one of them.
Kennedy reportedly ordered NASA not to fly Glenn again because he was too valuable as a national figure. Glenn resigned from the space agency in January 1964.
Political career
Glenn's fame made him a natural candidate for political office, and shortly after his resignation from NASA, he announced he would run for the Democratic ticket for a US Senate seat in 1964. But his political career was sidelined for a few years when an injury forced him to withdraw from the campaign.
Glenn then joined Royal Crown Cola as a vice president and later as president. Yet he remained interested in politics. He was also a close friend of the Kennedy family. On June 5, 1968, Glenn was with Sen. Robert Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, hours before Kennedy was shot by Sirhan Sirhan. Kennedy died the next day.
""Who knows what might have happened if Bobby had been president,"" Glenn reflected shortly after his 90th birthday, in a 2011 interview with the Dayton Daily News.
""I know he had just about more compassion for the underdog, for the poor, the downtrodden than, I think, just about anybody that I ever knew.""
After a failed bid for a US Senate seat in 1970, Glenn won in 1974, beginning a 24-year career representing Ohio on Capitol Hill. He was widely regarded as an effective legislator and moderate Democrat. He played a key role in weapons control, authoring the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, which prohibited the sale of nuclear equipment to nations that currently have none.
Glenn -- along with fellow Mercury 7 astronauts Grissom and Shepard -- was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978 by then-President Jimmy Carter.
More than 20 years after their historic missions, the team was immortalized in the 1983 movie ""The Right Stuff."" Glenn -- portrayed by Ed Harris -- didn't care much for the film, saying, ""I thought it was dramatic enough without Hollywood doing its number on it.""
Despite his rock-solid reputation as an American icon, not everything went perfectly for Glenn. In 1984, he decided to run for president, confidently declaring, ""With the nomination of my party I firmly believe I can beat Ronald Reagan.""
He was knocked out of the primaries early on.
A return to space
John Glenn's true hero
As he grew older, Glenn never gave up his dream of flying in space again or, as he called it in the Mercury days, being ""a willing guinea pig.""
At age 77, a year after retiring from the Senate, Glenn accepted an invitation from NASA to rejoin the space program as a member of space shuttle Discovery on a nine-day mission to study the aging process, which mirrors what astronauts experience during long durations in space.
On October 29, 1998, Glenn became the oldest human ever to venture into space, and his flight proved once again that he was a man who embraced a challenge.

"It looks like there is another story that SHOULD be huge, but the media is ignoring it. We always knew that John Kerry was a dishonest person, but it’s unreal that he’d stoop to such a low level.
According to , John Kerry influenced the State Department in such a way that $9 MILLION ended up in Seed Global Health — an organization run by Vanessa Kerry, who is none other than John’s daughter. At first, the State Department said that Kerry had NO idea this was happening. We have now discovered that he knew all along.
We are sick and TIRED of Democrats using their power to make their families rich. The Left wants to go around and say that Republicans are wasting money while funneling taxpayer dollars to their families — in this case — NINE MILLION DOLLARS! It is insanity at its finest. We cannot allow this to continue. How much of OUR money has gone to fund families of people who are already filthy rich?
It is a trend that is costing us MILLIONS of dollars. If we do not call out people like Kerry, we are allowing them to rob us blind without saying a word. If he wants to give his daughter money, he can buy her a card and put as much money as he wants in it. When he steals money from U. S. taxpayers, he is going to pay the price.
It is so hard to believe that the media is silent on this story. Can you imagine what would happen if a Republican was caught sending money to their family? It would be a witch hunt. CNN would broadcast 24/7 that they need to be stopped.
The scary part is they don’t need evidence to try and make that claim. We have all watched the media try to lie and deceive people about President Trump. But how long have they been covering for liberals making money off of OUR hard work?
Kerry needs to be investigated immediately for this fraud. It is as clear as day that he was just trying to find a way to make his daughter filthy rich, and he succeeded!
After he is found guilty, they need to strip that 9 million dollars away from her and put her in jail for receiving it. Obviously, there was a conversation between Kerry and his daughter about this money.
It went right in her pocket, and she was able to go on with her life nine million dollars richer, while homeless veterans are starving in the streets. We are OUTRAGED that they would insult the patriots of this country. If we had that extra money for veterans, we could accomplish SO much for them.

"Scientists shut down the communications system between the Rosetta spacecraft and the Philae probe early Wednesday, severing the link between the two craft. The European Space Agency (ESA) announcedthe event in a blog item published Tuesday, and marked the occasion with the Twitter hashtag #GoodbyePhilae.
Philae made a historic touch down on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in November, 2014, but a rough, bouncy landing resulted in the craft going silent after just a brief period. Although it again transmitted data in June and July of 2015, there hasn’t been a peep from Philae for over a year. In February, the ESA said that the lander was in “eternal hibernation.”
The lander’s mother ship is Rosetta, and it’s still alive— but nearing the end of its life too. On the last day of September, the ship will be slowly crashed into the surface of the comet, making measurements and sending back data as it descends. Turning off Rosetta’s communications system with Philae allows mission managers to conserve power for Rosetta’s final months. It will be about 323 million miles from the Sun by July’s end, meaning its solar panels will generate less power.
When Rosetta finishes its mission on September 30, it will bring to an end a remarkable mission that began when it was launched in 2004.
It’s time for me to say goodbye. Tomorrow, the unit on @ESA_Rosetta for communication with me will be switched off forever...— Philae Lander (@Philae2014) July 26, 2016
“We’re trying to squeeze as many observations in as possible before we run out of solar power,” Matt Taylor, ESA Rosetta project scientist, said in a statementin June. “30 September will mark the end of spacecraft operations, but the beginning of the phase where the full focus of the teams will be on science. That is what the Rosetta mission was launched for and we have years of work ahead of us, thoroughly analysing its data.”
According the ESA, the connection between Rosetta and Philae was cut at 11:00 CEST, which was 5:00 am EDT.",0
"Iran’s funding of terrorist groups that endanger Israel was reveleadin shocking detail by IDF Military Intelligence chief Maj.- Gen. Hertzi Halevi on Wednesday.
Talking at the IDC Herzliya Conference, Halevi uncovered that Iran is financing Hezbollah to the tune of $75 million a year, while paying $50m. of Hamas’ financial plan and roughly $70m. to Islamic Jihad.
Associating Hamas’ collusion with Iran to late feedback of Israel for the compassionate circumstance in the Gaza strip, Halevi put the fault for an absence of development supplies and the power issue soundly on Hamas.
Israel has let into the Strip “four times the volume of building materials” required to assemble one of the world’s biggest structures, yet “Hamas is utilizing the materials for war, not remaking,” he said.

"He opted to make the building, which sits just outside the Greenwich Village Historic District, 22 stories high, but set back the tower on a wide base that will house retail space. The residences in the tower will begin on the third floor.
The apartments have been designed so that each will be a corner unit, which allows for more natural light, especially since the tower is set back from the street, said Ms. Selldorf, who recently was given a medal of honor by the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
“I think recessing the residents back from the street equates to a more balanced footprint,” Ms. Selldorf said. “I understand the height is a concern to some people, including myself, but I designed the building to be discreet, simple and elegant, which fits the neighborhood.”
Andrew Berman, the executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, said he was disappointed with city officials for ignoring the organization’s plea to rezone the area and essentially prohibit such a tall structure.
There will be a total of 52 units in the sandstone-colored building, all with large casement windows that measure 8 feet by 5.6 feet. Units range from one-bedrooms, starting at $2.4 million, to four-bedrooms, priced from $8.25 million. There will be two penthouses and two townhomes, priced between $11.5 million to about $16 million. Each townhome will come with a private, 3,200-square-foot garden, according to Mr. Macklowe.
Ms. Selldorf said she liked that “residents and neighbors will be looking down on a green space” that will be built on the roof of the retail base.
Although Greenwich Village as a whole sees little new, ground-up construction, the northeastern pocket has seen some activity over the last several years as former parking garages have been turned into residences and new restaurants have popped up on the side streets.
“The location is A-plus-plus,” said Beth Fisher, a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is handling sales for the building. “It’ll attract people looking for new infrastructure and amenities that are not part of older properties.”
The building, which is also developed by Goldman Sachs, is steps away from Union Square and will also include a basement parking garage for residents. Other amenities include a residents’ lounge area that is attached to an outdoor terrace and a children’s playroom.
The more than 13,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space will help “clean up the streetscape,” Mr. Macklowe said.
Sales are expected to begin next month, with the building scheduled to be completed by late 2017 or early 2018.

"Shaken by revelations that presidential friends and relatives used a recent tax amnesty law to ""whitewash"" over $132 million in undeclared offshore funds, Argentine President Mauricio Macri has reportedly ordered Public Revenue head Alberto Abad to launch an internal investigation into the leak, first reported by the Buenos Aires news daily Pgina/12 on August 27.
The news raised concern among press freedom advocates in Argentina.
Macri had unsuccessfully pushed for language in the tax amnesty bill to penalize reporting on its beneficiaries with large fines and jail time. The conservative news daily La Nacin - a Macri ally - reported in April moreover that lawmakers, media figures, and even famed football forward Lionel Messi, are routinely spied on by Macri's intelligence agency AFI.
""It can't be that we cannot guarantee tax secrecy,"" Macri repeated angrily this week according to Casa Rosada sources. ""We look ridiculous to everybody.""
The Tax Amnesty Law, passed by Congress at Macri's urging in July 2016, was amended by decree that November to allow family, friends, and associates of the administration to take advantage of the offer, which drops all tax evasion charges or potential charges in exchange for a 10% payment.
The amnesty resulted in a record $116 billion in offshore funds being declared by the March 2017 deadline, although 93% remained offshore. Among those who thus ""whitewashed"" their previously undeclared funds were:
Nicols Caputo, the president's best friend and a top public works contractor for the city of Buenos Aires while Macri was mayor between 2007 and 2015: $26.5 million.
Alejandro Pea, cousin of the president's Chief of Staff Marcos Pea: $6.2 million.
Manuel Torino, brother-in-law of Pablo Clusellas - Secretary of the President's Legal and Technical Office, and childhood friend: $20 million.
Marcelo Mindlin, head of the nation's largest private electric company Pampa Energa and reputed cutout for the Macri family since his purchase of their public works contractor IECSA in March: $44 million.
And Gianfranco Macri, the president's brother: $35.5 million.
Federal prosecutors are investigating at least six cases involving Macri, some of them stemming from his family's extensive business holdings.
Allegations range from influence trafficking to money laundering related to the Panama Papers, the Odebrecht scandal, the purchase of a failing Macri charter airline (MacAir) by Colombia's Avianca in exchange for access to local routes, and an attempted write-off of up to $250 million in Macri Group debts to the Argentine postal service.
So far none of the cases has resulted in charges against the president, and he denies wrongdoing; but they've become a headache for his center-right ""Let's Change"" coalition heading into legislative elections on October 22.
""The suspicion is that Gianfranco Macri's $35.5 million declaration puts the lie to Mauricio Macri's financial disclosure affidavits,"" opposition Congressman Daro Martnez said. ""The president claims that his capital amounts to $4.7 million, or seven times less than what his brother whitewashed.""
""Then only two hypotheses fit: or poor Mauricio was disinherited; or, Mauricio is not as poor as he claims and is hiding much of his estate.""",1
"Radiation is usually associated with the atomic bomb, nuclear disasters like Fukushima, and microwave ovens. But did you know we are surrounded by radiation every single day from everyday objects we didn’t even think would have anything to do with radiation?
Ir’s true, and the people over at GeoBeats have put together this great video outlining just how many radioactive substances surround us in our day to day lives!
Radioactive objects are the sorts of things people generally try to avoid, but it turns out that doing so may not be so easy. The world is full of seemingly benign things that emit radiation.
Here are 10 of them.
Number 10. Exit signs. For them to function during emergencies that involve power outages, they have to be able to glow on their own. The substance that most often allows them to do so is tritium, which gets its illuminating power via a nuclear reaction.
Number 9. Granite countertops. It turns out microwaves are not the only kitchen standbys that emit radiation. As granite ages the naturally occurring particles of radium, thorium, and uranium within it decay, sending radon gas into the air.
Number 8. Kitty Litter. Don’t worry, neither you nor your fluffy little friend are at risk. Trace amounts of radioactive elements exist in the clay and though they’re significant enough to set off super-sensitive, government-grade detectors, they don’t exist in quantities that are physically harmful.
Number 7. Bananas. While the fruit is a common measure for how dangerous some substances and items are, they’re in the benign range of the comparative scale. Due to the presence of an isotope of potassium they emit a measurable amount of activity, but it’s so low a person would have to eat 5 million of them before they showed signs of contamination.
Number 6. Brazil nuts. High concentrations of radium make this by far the most radioactive food known. It has at least thousand times more of it than a banana, and nearly 1 and a half times the potassium content as well.
Number 5. Glossy magazines. Both the paper and the coating on it are often rich in the clay kaolin, which contains relatively elevated amounts of uranium and thorium. By comparison, reading a shiny publication subjects a person to a fraction of the amount that’s generally present in the environment.
Number 4. Porcelain teeth and crowns. To make them pearly white, those than craft the dental materials often add uranium.
Number 3. Smoke detectors. Some models of the life-saving devices work by maintaining a steady current so when it experiences interruptions, like those caused by smoke, it can sound an alarm. A bit of americium-241 is added to ensure that the current stays consistent.
Number 2. Antiques. Back in the day people weren’t quite as savvy about radioactive materials, and thus they ended up in items from kitchenware to watches. Prior to the 1970s uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 were often added to colored glazes due to the unique and vibrant hues they helped produce.
Number 1. Humans. Human bodies emit doses of radiation. According to one report, sleeping next to a person for a year exposes one to more of it than living within 50 miles of a nuclear plant for the same amount of time.
Which radioactive everyday things are you most surprised by?",1
"Less than ten years ago, 26 million Americans were receiving assistance to buy groceries – enrolled in the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program.
Today, after eight years of the Obama economy and the ever-expanding welfare policies, that number has exploded to 44 million who need help every month to put food on the table.
For many families, that is in addition to free breakfast and free lunch programs at public schools.
And yet, critics of President Trump’s proposed budget that would shift to a “welfare to work” policy that could move as many as six million Americans from dependency to self-sufficiency.
White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney appeared before Congress to discuss the president’s first budget and defended the proposal that Democrats call “cruel.”
“Growth cures so many ills, he said. “If you’re on food stamps and able-bodied, we need you to go to work.”
Although critics claim the economy is already operating at “full employment capacity,” Mulvaney says figures indicate that businesses should be able to take on in excess of an additional six million employees in the Trump economy.
Many states, like Colorado, have had similar programs in place for several years that would provide a prototype for the federal government, which funds the state-run SNAP benefits.
Georgia implemented a work requirement for residents receiving SNAP benefits beginning January 1, 2016, in just 3 of its 159 counties, expanding the pilot program to 21 counties.
Those who received the benefits were required to work at least 20 hours a week or be enrolled in state-approved job training or volunteering at a non-profit or charity.
Those who were unable to work because of a disability and the elderly were, of course, exempt, but the results in a mere 16-months are startling.
More than half, a shocking 62 percent of SNAP recipients in those counties, 7,251 dropped out of the food stamp program.
In what may be a smart move, the Trump budget proposal would take a page from successful state programs and apply it on a national basis to help many of the 44 million food stamp recipients find productive work that could move them to independence – while saving the government money.
What seems like a win-win will be characterized by opposition in Congress as proof that Republicans do not care about the poor and the minorities who make up the vast majority of those who rely on assistance for the barest of necessities.
Congress will again take up consider the budget when members return after the long Memorial Day weekend.",1

"US and South Korean forces are holding live-fire naval exercises in the waters around the peninsula, involving the USS Ronald Reagan carrier strike group, nominally to practice against special operations forces.
US forces will also practice evacuating American noncombatants from South Korea. Though this training occurs regularly, it could be misinterpreted when it occurs in parallel with other forceful signals. Furthermore, two submarines have visited the Korean Peninsula, including the USS Michigan, a guided missile submarine.

US B-1B bombers fly near North Korean coast 01:25
In the skies around the peninsula, B1-B bomber flights are becoming more complex and more assertive. One month ago, at least one B1-B and an escort of F-35 fighters flew over international waters north of the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. Last week, US B1-Bs performed a missile-firing drill in the seas between Korea and Japan, crossed the peninsula and did another drill in the Yellow Sea near China. JASSM missiles carried by the B1-B could reach into Chinese territory from those launch points.
Last week, the B1-Bs were back in South Korea for an airshow, along with F-22 and F-35 advanced stealth fighters and other military aircraft. On Monday, the US Air Force announced that 12 F-35As will deploy next month to Japan.
In short, in the last month, the US has rehearsed all the actions it would need to take to start a war.

Military provocations
Announcements of these actions come with vague and repeated statements from the White House that it is actively considering military options and ""time is running out"" for alternatives. The administration is apparently trying to paint missions intended to assure US allies as military preparations in order to aggravate Pyongyang and Beijing.
These provocations seem based on an idea that raising the risk of war can force China or North Korea to capitulate to Washington's demands, ignoring recent history.
The last 10 months of vague threats and sporadic military provocations prove Kim Jong Un cannot be frightened into surrendering his nuclear arsenal: in early July, a month after two US aircraft carriers staged drills off South Korea, the North tested its first ICBM. In fact, last month Kim said personally he considers Trump's vague threats a sign of weakness and proof that North Korea must stay its course.
China is also unlikely to bow to military pressure. Beijing's overwhelming concern of the last few months has been to keep the US and North Korea quiet ahead of the Communist Party's National Congress, a highly choreographed event during which President Xi Jinping will consolidate his power.
In the past, North Korea has staged missile and other tests during high-profile Chinese meetings, but Xi will have warned Kim in no uncertain terms this is not the week to act out.
In his tweets and statements, Trump has repeatedly attempted to exploit China-North Korea tensions, with little of consequence to show for it. Are US military moves this month designed to provoke a North Korean test during the Chinese party congress? Are American exercises in the Yellow Sea meant to alarm Beijing? It's not clear.

Time for deterrence
Each of the recent US military deployments is temporary: at the end of the event or exercise, the ships and aircraft will rotate onto other missions. Despite major advancements in North Korean nuclear and missile programs and concerns from US allies about Washington's willingness to defend them, the administration has not authorized new military deployments to South Korea.
In this, the current US military posture may be the worst of both worlds: it raises the possibility of an altercation with North Korea without providing the extra forces to deter and defend against one. In this climate, there is a very real risk that any military move could lead to an accidental war if North Korea's leaders miscalculate or feel pressured to demonstrate defiance in the face of US threats.
The US and its allies have no interest in provoking North Korea. The Trump administration should set aside the false hope there is a military solution to the problem with Pyongyang and abandon its careless threats to attack North Korea.
Both Washington and Seoul should stop threatening Kim Jong Un with ""decapitation""; if Kim rightly or wrongly believes an assassination attempt is on the way, this will raise the risk of a preemptive nuclear strike.
Finally, temporary military displays send precisely the wrong signal to Pyongyang: they raise the risk of an unwanted war and raise questions about whether the US is really committed to deterring North Korea in the long run.
If the Trump administration can cease its careless threats, the US and its allies could begin a real conversation about whether new deployments of unambiguously defensive military forces are needed to deter North Korea. Pyongyang cannot be allowed to think its new nuclear missiles will allow it to attack with submarines or special operations forces. The allies need new capabilities to deter this kind of aggression, but it will require a sustained effort, not a week-long visit from an aircraft carrier.
Holding to a defensive military posture would also afford US military commanders and diplomats new deterrent and diplomatic options for preventing North Korea from launching missiles toward Guam or conducting an atmospheric nuclear test -- practical but vital objectives for the coming months.
The security of the US homeland and our allies requires that we maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula, not undermine it. It is time to abandon wishful thinking and get serious about deterring a nuclear North Korea.",0
"North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the US,”
But what we all know is the fact that we have Nuclear capabilities! But instead of nukes, the US Army has a whole arsenal of weapons thatwe can use to crush them!
The Northrop (later Northrop Grumman) B-2 Spirit, also known as the Stealth Bomber, is an American heavy penetration strategic bomber, featuring low observable stealth technology designed for penetrating dense anti-aircraft defenses; it is a flying wing design with a crew of two.
Development originally started under the “Advanced Technology Bomber” (ATB) project during the Carter administration; its expected performance was one of his reasons for the cancellation of the supersonic B-1A bomber.
The ATB project continued during the Reagan administration, but worries about delays in its introduction led to the reinstatement of the B-1 program as well. Program costs rose throughout development.
Designed and manufactured by Northrop, later Northrop Grumman, the cost of each aircraft averaged US$737 million (in 1997 dollars).Total procurement costs averaged $929 million per aircraft, which includes spare parts, equipment, retrofitting, and software support.
The total program cost including development, engineering and testing, averaged $2.1 billion per aircraft in 1997.
North Korea might have couple of Nuclear war heads but we have superior weapons and 1,796 nuclear missiles deployed, another 4,500 stockpiled, and 2,800 retired and waiting to be dismantled! North Korea should be afraid for sure!

"(CNN) — Don't be surprised if your favorite city feels a bit more crowded the next time you visit.
The United Nations World Tourism Organization has released its latest UNWTO World Tourism Barometer and the flood of global travelers looking to journey beyond their borders is stronger than ever.
Numbers indicate that destinations worldwide received 369 million international tourists (overnight visitors) in the first four months of 2017 -- a whopping 21 million more than in the same few months of 2016.
Perhaps even more surprising are the report's figures highlighting the fastest-growing tourist destinations in 2017, based on international arrivals.
These include up-and-coming destinations such as Mongolia, alongside tourism stalwarts Vietnam and Iceland.
The data also reveals that countries recently plagued by terrorism or political unrest -- such as Egypt and Tunisia -- still have the tourism pull to rebound from a downward turn.
Intrigued? Here are UNWTO's fastest-growing tourist destinations in 2017, along with their growth rates, and their full-year figures for 2016.
1. Palestinian territories: up 57.8%. (400,000 visitors in 2016).
2. Egypt: up 51%. (5.26 million visitors in 2016).
3. Northern Mariana Islands: up 37.3%. (531,000 visitors in 2016).

"News 8 – From the early 1900s to the early 1980s, the birth certificate of an African American child was labeled with the term “Negro.”As early as the 1700’s, a child with at least 1/4 “negro blood” (mixed) was labeled a “mulatto.” That term carried on through the 1940s.Currently, there are over 22 million birth certificates in the United States still labeled as “Negro” – a term that was taken out the pits of slavery.
On Monday, the Supreme Court signed an amendment tothe U. S. National Center for Health Statistics laws to make it mandatory for them to change every birth certificate on record that labels and African American citizen as a “Negro” or “Mulatto.”According to analysts however, this is putting a huge dent inthenational deficit. Considering the labor, printing, postage and servicing, this is going to run the taxpayers nearly $100 million.
But from the view of this African-American man, Clifford Reynolds, this move was long overdue. “I was born in 1968, and my birth certificate say Negro. I’m nota damn Negro, I’m a black man. I got the right NOT have that racist word on my birth certificate. And do I care about the cost?? Hell No!! They owe us reparations anyways.”
James Moore, an Imperial of the Loyal White Knights (KKK) says they plan to picket the White House to show their disgust over this new amendment.
Moore had plenty to say about his thoughts on changing over 22 million birth certificates from the term “Negro” to African-American. However, his comments were so extremely racist that we can’t even quote them in thisarticle.
Let’s just say he does not agree with the change. One thing he did say is that if they plan to riot over this injustice, “We won’t do it in our own neighborhoods like those dumb -**–. We’re going to loot in Compton.”

"Emirates, the Middle East's largest airline, saw its annual profit drop by a whooping 82 percent for its 2016-2017 year. The company in part put blame for the dramatic decrease on the Trump administration's decision to ban laptop use on Middle Eastern flights.
The airline said in its annual 2016-2017 report that it generated a revenue of AED 1.3 billion ($340 million) until March 31, constituting its lowest profit in five years. In the 2012-2013 fiscal year, Emirates earned AED 2.283 billion (US $621) million and closed the 2015-2016 year with a high of AED 7.125 billion (US $1.93 billion).

""The New Year ushered in a new president in the United States, and a new administration which in its first three months issued a raft of new measures relating to entry requirements, enhanced security vetting procedures, and restrictions on personal electronic devices in aircraft cabins,"" said His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, chief executive of Emirates Airline and Group. ""These all directly impacted Emirates’ operations into the US.""
He also called 2016-2017 the airline's ""most challenging year to date.""
Emirates slashed five flights on five U. S. routes in April 2017 after the Trump administration introduced new security measures, banning laptop use on direct flights from 10 Middle Eastern airports including Emirates' main airport, Dubai International.
Since then, the carrier dropped its daily flights from Fort Lauderdale and Orlando to five times a week and reduced the twice daily Seattle and Boston flight pattern to once daily.
The airline also announced that it wouldn't be paying dividends to Investment Corporation of Dubai, the state investment body that owns the airline. Last year, it contributed AED 2.6 billion (US $707 million). The report cited the ""current business climate"" as the reason behind this decision.
""We remain optimistic for the future of our industry, although we expect the year ahead to remain challenging with hyper competition squeezing airline yields, and volatility in many markets impacting travel flows and demand,"" said H. H. Sheikh Maktoum.
Although the airlines carried 56.1 million passengers, up by 8 percent from last year, it faced a drop in passenger seat factor — the number of seats filled — by 1.4 percent, from 76.5 percent to 75.1 percent. It also reported a 10 percent slump in passenger yield. Plane capacity had an uptick with a 7.2 percent boost to 60 million seats filled.
Emirates has faced an avalanche of problems in terms of investing and gaining profits, with challenges that include a rising U. S. dollar market amid failing oil prices, as well as an increase in militant actions in Europe.
The Dubai carrier invested AED 13.7 billion (US $3.7 billion) in new aircraft, equipment and modern facilities but the overall Emirates Group saw a 70 percent dip in its total profits at AED 2.5 billion (US $670 million).
The company also increased its total workforce by 11 percent to more than 105,000 employees and purchased 35 new aircraft, the highest amount in a single fiscal year since 2012-2013. However, it deferred deliveries of 12 Airbus A380 superjumbos in December, and remained mum about its plans to expand to 15 U. S. locations by 2018.
The airline introduced two new routes to Phnom Penh and Zagreb, and intends to partake in a $11 million make-over of its lounges in Dubai in 2017.",0

"Hours after the University of Maryland denied several media reports Saturday that Athletic Director Kevin Anderson had been fired, Anderson himself was nowhere to be found at the school’s home football game against Northwestern.
The embattled administrator did not visit his usual seat on the second row of press row, nor was he there to greet Terrapins Coach DJ Durkin after his postgame remarks in the auditorium of Gossett Team House, something Anderson traditionally does after each game, whether at home or on the road. It was the third consecutive game Anderson has missed.
That absence, which the school did not provide an explanation for after the Terrapins lost, 37-21, to the Wildcats in College Park, was at the heart of a bizarre day for the athletic department.
After several reports early Saturday afternoon claimed that Anderson had been fired or placed on administrative leave after a falling-out with Maryland President Wallace D. Loh, the school sent out a 13-word response on Twitter: “Kevin Anderson is UMD Athletic Director. Media reports to the contrary are false.”
School officials have not addressed Anderson’s ongoing absence. A person with knowledge of the situation said Anderson had not been in his office on campus since late last month.
The seventh-year athletic director also did not travel to Maryland football’s games at Minnesota and Ohio State over the past three weeks and was not present at a football alumni dinner Friday evening.
None of Maryland’s top athletic brass were visible as they typically are in the press box of Saturday’s game against Northwestern, either, including Executive Athletic Director Damon Evans, who has beenone of Anderson’s chief lieutenants since 2014. Evans arrived instead of Anderson at Durkin’s postgame news conference and greeted the second-year coach after a few minutes of somber remarks. Evans didnot comment on Anderson.
While it does not appear Anderson’s absence is due to a personal matter, the confusion over his status played out through a number of contradictory reports.
A Maryland spokesman did not confirm or deny whether Anderson had been placed on administrative leave earlier this month, after ESPN reported that development had been confirmed by a university spokesman. That report later reversed course and stated that a spokesman had said Anderson is not on leave and has not been fired after the school had issued its statement.
Anderson texted a screenshot of the school’s announcement to The Washington Post in response to a request for comment on his status. He did not respond to requests for further comment.
MASNsports.com reported earlier Saturday that Anderson has been fired and was removed from his post by Loh after Anderson had expressed interest in the vacant athletic director position at California earlier this fall.
That came just after Anderson and Loh unveiled, in August, the first completed phase of the new Cole Field House, which is being renovated into an indoor football facility and center for sports medicine.
Loh said in August that the project had raised about $60 million of its $90 million fundraising goal, although the school announced over the summer that the initial $155 million price tag for the project had increased by roughly 25 percent to $196 million, with the athletic department responsible for $19 million of that cost.
Anderson, who grew up in San Francisco and graduated from San Francisco State, also reportedly expressed interest when that same position at Cal was open in 2015. Anderson was an assistant athletic director at Cal from 1997 to 2002.
Anderson took over at Maryland in 2010 after serving in the same role for six years at Army and oversaw Maryland’s transition to the Big Ten that began in 2012. He initially signed a five-year deal in 2010 worth more than $401,000 in annual compensation; that deal is designed to be renewed each year on Sept. 30 unless terminated.
Former Maryland men’s basketball coach Gary Williams was the subject of speculation Saturday that he might be a popular choice as Anderson’s replacement, but a person close to Williams, 72, said he has no interest in the job.
Anderson’s tenure has often been polarizing. His first major move came in late 2010, when he fired Ralph Friedgen as football coach and replaced him two weeks later with Randy Edsall. Anderson fired Edsall after 4 1/2 seasons in October 2015 and subsequently pegged Durkin to fill the role.
Anderson made a splash by hiring Mark Turgeon as men’s basketball coach in 2011 but also endured turbulence while managing a money-strapped athletic department during the early stages of his tenure. He cut seven nonrevenue sports in July 2012 in an effort to cut into a multimillion dollar deficit within the department.
Durkin said Saturday that Anderson’s absence did not have an effect on his team’s loss. He was the only member of the athletic department to comment on the issue.

On August 2, 2004, Bank of America broke ground on its 2.2 million square foot, NYC headquarters – the Bank of America Tower.
The all-glass tower would rise 57 stories above midtown Manhattan, with a giant spire taking the height to 1,200 ft. It’s currently the fourth-tallest building in New York City, and it cost $1 billion.
The next year, investment bank Goldman Sachs broke ground on its $2.4 billion headquarters in downtown NYC.
The investment bank brought an entire village to its Battery Park City digs – including several restaurants from famed restaurateur Danny Meyer, a wine store, a florist, a bakery and a barber shop.
Goldman also bought a nearby hotel (which included a movie theater) and a parking garage.
But before either bank moved into their new headquarters, the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 hit. Bank of America and Goldman’s share prices fell by 93% and 79%.
In 1999, a real estate analyst named Andrew Lawrence introduced the “Skyscraper Indicator.” He notes the world’s biggest buildings are typically erected on the eve of a crisis.
It all started with a building called 40 Wall Street.
At the same time, another new building, The Chrysler Building, was planning a secret spire so it could claim the title of the world’s tallest tower.
But planners for the Empire State Building had them both beat.
Certainly there’s a part of the Skyscraper Indicator which shows ‘peak hubris.’ Big companies have to show off how rich and successful they are.
But more importantly, huge skyscrapers are also an indication that it’s way too easy to borrow huge sums of money.
And that ‘easy money’ is also an indicator of the top.
Right now we’re seeing this architectural hubris moving west… to Silicon Valley.
In San Francisco there’s a $1.1 billion, 1,070-foot high tower, set to open next year.
And Salesforce, the customer relationship management software giant, bought the naming rights. Salesforce paid the developer, Boston Property, $560 million to lease part of the building for 15.5 years.
When the company announced it would put its name on the building, it had never turned an annual profit.
Coincidentally, Salesforce also put its name on an NYC tower located at 3 Bryant Park – next door to Bank of America.
But it’s not just Salesforce that’s on a spending spree.
Amazon has a $4 billion campus in Seattle. In front of the tower, you’ll find three giant, glass spheres. The tallest is 90 feet high and 130 feet in diameter.
The spheres will have trees, waterfalls, rivers and even treehouse spaces. The company hired a world-class horticulturist to populate the 70,000-square foot space with tropical plants from around the world.
Amazon won’t say how much it spent on the spheres. But King County, where Amazon HQ is located, estimates total improvements to the block (including the tower) at $284 million.
“The tech industry is trying now to express itself through buildings,” said Gundula Proksch, a professor of architecture at the University of Washington.
Businesses don’t exist to “express themselves” through architecture. They exist to maximize returns for shareholders.
And Silicon Valley is famously inept in producing profits… like our old friend Netflix, which lost $2 billion last quarter.
Or Snapchat. Uber. Tesla. Box. Twitter. Zynga. Groupon. Lyft. LinkedIn (which was acquired by Microsoft last year). Workday. Pinterest. Square.
This list goes on and on.
The company, having lost billions upon billions of dollars of its shareholders’ money, is spending another $250 million on its new headquarters in the
San Francisco area.
And Apple (which actually IS profitable) just held its first public event at its new $5 billion ‘spaceship campus’ yesterday.
All of this comes at a time when stock markets both in the United States and around the world are at record highs.
And, according to a recent investor survey from Wells Fargo and Gallup, confidence and optimism among US investors is at its highest level in 17 years.
17 years ago, of course, was 2000… the year that the great dot-com stock market bubble burst (after which the NASDAQ index fell 78%).
At the same time, we can see very expensive valuations–
One important example is the S&P 500’s Price/Sales ratio.
This ratio tells investors how expensive a company’s stock price is relative to the amount of revenue that it generates.
Ideally you’d want to buy shares in a company whose value (stock price) is a very low multiple to its revenue.
Yet according to data going back more than 50 years, the Price/Sales ratio across the entire US market is at its most expensive level ever.
Personally I am a very risk averse person– I don’t like losing money.
I’m only willing to take significant risks when the potential for return can be 50:1 or more (like speculating in select, early-stage businesses).
To me, this stock market is simply too expensive. And I’m not willing to risk being down 20% to 50%, for the prospect of earning 20% to 50%.
Those odds just don’t stack up.
No one has a crystal ball. And this market can continue being irrational for months or years to come.
The only thing we know for certain is that markets are cyclical. Right now we’re in a boom.
As always, it will be followed by a bust. We just don’t know when.
But in the meantime I’d rather earn 10% to 15% on more conservative, alternative investments where the risk of loss is almost zero… waiting patiently for the right buying opportunity to come along.

"Call it what you want, but Reputation is shaping up to be another massive hit for Taylor Swift.
The pop star's highly anticipated sixth album has already sold more than 400,000 pre-orders ahead of its Nov. 10 release, according to the Associated Press. That tally includes purchases from Swift's website, iTunes, Amazon, Walmart and Target, where it's the highest music pre-sale in the retail chain'shistory.
More:Is Taylor Swift failing on the charts? Here's why her first two singles haven't soared
For perspective, Reputation's pre-orders are double those of Swift's last album, the Grammy-winning 1989, a week before its release in 2014.That effort bowed at No. 1 with 1.3 million copiessold its first week, making Swift the first artist ever to have three albums sell a million copies in a week (after 2012's Red, with 1.2 million,and 2010's Speak Now, with 1 million).
Despite her lack of media appearances, Swift has aggressively marketed Reputation: teaming with Target and UPS for exclusive album and collectible bundles, and giving fans who pre-order music and merchandise priority to purchase tickets through Ticketmaster for her upcoming tour.
The singer has so far released four songs from Reputation including Look What You Made Me Do, ...Ready For It?, Gorgeous and most recently, Call It What You Want. She is set to perform another track during next Thursday's episode of ABC's Scandal, the day before the album hits shelves on Nov. 10.",0
"Ryanair, Europe's biggest short-haul airline, plans to reduce winter services at its main London hub and pursue growth at other bases because of weakened British economic prospects following the country's vote to leave the EU.
CEO Michael O'Leary made the announcement Monday as part of Ryanair's first-quarter earnings, which underscored the company's unrelenting growth and profit increases.
Ryanair reported a 4 percent rise in net profit to 256 million euros ($233 million) as it carried 31.2 million passengers in the April-June period, 11 percent more than a year ago. That was partly achieved by charging fares averaging 39.92 euros ($36.35), 10 percent less than in the same period of 2015.
Shares in Ryanair were up 5.7 percent at 11.53 euros ($10.50) on the latest set of expectations-beating figures from the Dublin-based carrier.
O'Leary called British voters' June 23 referendum rejection of continued EU membership ""a surprise and a disappointment"" that would undermine consumer demand, including at Ryanair's biggest hub, Stansted Airport, northeast of London. He had campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain in the 28-nation bloc.
He said Ryanair might benefit competitively in the medium term if the U. K. does quit the EU, because this might force British-registered competitors such as easyJet to withdraw from intra-EU routes, while Irish-registered Ryanair would face potential regulatory challenges only to its internal British services. The Republic of Ireland remains firmly committed to EU membership.
""In the meantime, we will pivot our growth away from U. K. airports and focus more on growing at our EU airports over the next two years,"" he said.",0

"After failing to repeal Obamacare, taxes have become a prime target for President Trump and are currently his ""highest focus,"" says Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, according to Politico. And, as the government grapples with how to raise revenue to offset any cuts, negotiators are drawing inspiration from former Republican Rep. Dave Camp's  2014 tax plan.
One ""idea quietly being discussed,"" Politico reports, is to tax the money employees designate for their 401(k) plans up front.
Currently, any money placed in a 401(k) plan is tax-deferred. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal, which starts at age 70 at the latest.
A change to the rules would go against statements previously made by the White House, which assured reporters following the initial announcement of Trump's proposed plan that, despite some confusion, reforms would not affect 401(k) contributions.
The idea of taxing 401(k) contributions differently already has detractors, including ""budget hawks, who consider it a gimmick; the financial services industry that handles retirement savings; and nonprofits that try to encourage Americans to save,"" says Politico.
Should the rules change, it would affect your 401(k) in two major ways: The amount you owe in taxes and when you would have to pay.
More: Ask a Fool: Which companies would benefit most from tax reform?
Jamie Dimon: America needs tax reform to spur competition and growth
The 401(k) plan is the leading retirement savings vehicle in the U. S., with more than 55 million active users contributing over $5 trillion to the plans as of March 2017.
Advocates of the current tax-deferred 401(k) plan say that ""reducing your taxable income this year with your pre-tax contributions is more valuable to you if your expectation is that you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement,"" as CNBC's Carla Fried reports.
But Fried warns that this doesn't always amount to the best financial scenario later on. ""If the bulk of your retirement savings are in traditional 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts, the [required minimum distributions] are likely to keep your rate from plummeting, especially once you add in other income sources such as Social Security and, perhaps, a pension,"" she writes.
In short, if you expect to be in a lower income bracket in retirement than you'll be at the peak of your career, paying taxes up front will cost you. But, as Fried points out, you might end up in a higher income bracket in retirement than you think.
However, this argument may be irrelevant to the realities of many Americans' current financial situations. The added cost of paying taxes up front could reduce the amount many individuals are able to contribute, or hinder their ability to save for the future at all.
Americans' retirement savings are already dangerously low. According to a 2016 report from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), the median working-age family (50th percentile) had only $5,000 saved in 2013. In contrast, the top one percent of families had $1.08 million or more stashed away in 2013, or 216 times more.",0
"The UShas reportedly airlifted a number of ISIS militants near the eastern Syrian city of Dayr al-Zawr, where Syrian troops are closing in on the terrorists.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that two US helicopters conducted the operation on Thursday morning, taking four ISIS members and a civilian from a house that had been used as an arms depot.
According to the report, the five people transferred during the operation included a foreign bomb expert, three Egyptian Daesh members and a civilian.
Witnesses found shaved hair of the five individuals near the area, the observatory said, adding that after airlifting the Daesh members, troops blew up the arms depot.
The US and its allies have been conducting airstrikes against what are said to be Daesh targets inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate.
The military alliance has repeatedly been accused of targeting and killing civilians. It has also been largely incapable of fulfilling its declared aim of destroying Daesh.
The US has long been accused of colluding with Daesh to provide safe passage and logistic support to the members of the Takfiri group in conflict zones.
In June, the commander of the Russian forces in Syria, Colonel General Sergei Surovikin, accused US-led forces in Syria of colluding with the Daesh leaders who surrender the areas under their control and head to provinces where Syrian government forces operate.
The Russian commander also criticized Washington for trying to block Syrian government forces from taking control of the country’s southern border.
Political observers warn that the US is using Daesh to create chaos in the Middle East and pursue Israel’s plan to change the Middle East map by disintegrating the regional countries.",1
"There have been calls for British Prime Minister David Cameron to resign following the Panama papers revelations.
It was first believed that there was 30,000 in Cameron’s offshore account in the Bahamas, but according to a report by investigative journalist and nationally-distributed columnist Wayne Masden, the amount was at least two million pounds
British Prime Minister David Cameron tried to fend off criticism of an offshore trust maintained in the Bahamas by his father Ian Cameron and which he inherited upon his father’s death in 2010. The details of the trust were contained in the massive tranche of documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which were leaked to the media by the dubious International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), an operation funded by George Soros, the CIA-connected U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Ford Foundation.
In defending his connection to the tax-avoidance trust, Blairmore Holdings Inc., for which his father was a director, Cameron said, “We owned 5,000 units in Blairmore Investment Trust, which we sold in January 2010. That was worth something like 30,000 pounds.” By “we,” Cameron was referring to himself and wife Samantha, who jointly held the Bahamas trust. In related news, WMR has learned that the financial scandal involving both Blairmore Holdings, Inc. and the JR Central 2 million pay-off to Cameron has resulted in significant marital problems between David and Samantha Cameron and that a divorce is imminent.
However, according to senior British Conservative Party sources who spoke on background to WMR, Cameron had at least 2 million in offshore accounts. The money was paid to Cameron, according to the sources, as part of a deal by JR Central, a subsidiary of Japan Railways, to secure a lucrative contract to lay new rails for HS2, the new high-speed British rail system. When completed, the rail system was designed to be faster than the French TGV high-speed railway.
In order to ensure that JR Central received the contract for laying the rails for HS2, the firm spread the largesse of its bribes across the British political spectrum in 2015. In addition to Cameron’s 2 million; 1 million to Sir Jeremy Heywood, Britain’s Cabinet Secretary and senior civil servant; 1 million to Nick Clegg, the former leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and Cameron’s deputy prime minister in the ill-fated Tory-Lib Dem coalition that survived until 2015; and 1 million to Ed Miliband, the former leader of the Labor Party.
In addition to the individual pay-offs, WMR has been informed that JR Central arranged what were described as “bungs,” English slang for “bribes,” to the major political parties. The Conservative Party received 25 million, Labor 10 million, and the Liberal Democrats 10 million.
The entire 50 million bribery package was paid through Nomura Bank in Tokyo. However, British intelligence sources told WMR that the U. S. Central Intelligence Agency detected the movement of the money. Based on a tip-off by CIA officers in London, Tory political leaders, who are in favor of a British exit from the European Union, discovered the Japanese money in Conservative Party accounts. These anti-EU Conservative politicians also discovered that Cameron arranged for the JR Central pay-off when, after his Liberal Democratic and pro-EU coalition partners were decimated in the 2015 election, Cameron was forced to commit to a referendum to approve continued EU membership for the United Kingdom. Before the election, Cameron and Heywood secretly agreed that there would be no referendum on continued EU membership for Britain.
The multi-billion pound railway contract for JR Central was contingent on Britain remaining inside the European Union. Cameron and the Japanese had every reason to keep Britain inside the EU and promote the “yes to Europe” vote in the referendum.
Cameron is facing calls for his resignation as a result of the 30,000 offshore trust in the Bahamas. The real scandal, WMR is told by authoritative sources inside the Conservative Party and MI-6 is that Cameron has siphoned into offshore accounts more than 2 million.",1
"Arlington, VA; November 18, 2013 -- Fifty years later, audiences are still fascinated by John F. Kennedy's legendary charisma, drawing a crowd to PBS programs exploring his life and legacy.

Passage of diary to be read out
Frank was a German-born Jewish teenager who kept a diary of her time in hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam before she was killed at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.
""We are shocked by these anti-Jewish expressions, which are extremely painful to those who have experienced the consequences of the persecution of the Jews,"" said a statement published on the Anne Frank website.
""Fighting football-related anti-Semitism is part of our educational activities. We are pleased to see that others, including Italian football clubs, have expressed their indignation about this action.""
In response to Sunday's incident in Rome, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) has announced plans to hold a minute's silence before all Serie A, B and C matches this week while a passage from Frank's diary is read out over loudspeakers.

The excerpt that will be read out says: ""I see the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness; I hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too.
""I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too shall end, that peace and tranquility will return once more.""
In a statement, the FIGC said their move was part of their commitment ""for a civil society so that young people in particular are brought up with the correct values.""

Sulley Muntari: Racism happens every game 03:31
'New low in Italian football'
Hardcore Lazio fans, called ""ultras,"" have a history of anti-Semitic behavior, while racism is still a problem in Italian football.
In April, Ghana midfielder Sulley Muntari left the pitch during a top-flight Italian game after being booked for complaining of being abused by a section of fans.
Academic Alberto Testa, who spent time with Lazio and Roma ultras for the book ""Football, Fascism and Fandom: The UltraS of Italian Football,"" described Sunday's incident as a new low in the history of Italian football.
He also doubted that Lazio's gesture would help eradicate racism and anti-Semitism in the country, questioning why it was only in September 2017 that Italy's lower house of parliament approved a bill aimed at curbing fascist propaganda.

""It's a big disease, racism in Italian society,"" Testa told CNN Sport.
""They are cultural problems and they are problems connected with how society is structured. It is a very complex issue and when I speak about this I say that the stadium in Italy -- and let's not forget that this infiltration of the right is a problem in Europe -- reflects what happens in society.
""If politicians don't condemn racism, if the media continue to use the 'N-word' and treat this episode as banter then we will never resolve this problem.
""Yes, Lazio has reacted very strongly. It's very good what they did. But we need to send a strong signal that this thing is not acceptable. They [the fans responsible] need to be banned for life from the stadium.
""Anne Frank is not only a symbol of the tragedy of the holocaust but also a kid. This is a new low in the history of Italian football and racism.""

"CVS Pharmacy will limit opioid prescriptions to a seven-day supply for certain conditions, becoming the first national retail chain to restrict how many pain pills doctors can give patients.
When filling prescription for opioid pills, pharmacists will also be required to talk to patients about the risks of addiction, secure storage of medications in the home and proper disposal, the retail pharmacy chain said Thursday.
The move by CVS to limit prescription opioids like OxyContin or Vicodin to a seven-day supply is a significant restriction for patients — the average pill supply given by doctors in the U. S. increased from 13 days in 2006 to 18 days 2015, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
'We are further strengthening our commitment to help providers and patients balance the need for these powerful medications with the risk of abuse and misuse,” Larry J. Merlo, President and CEO, CVS Health said in a statement.
CVS, which manages medications for nearly 90 million customers at 9,700 retail locations, plans to roll out the initiatives to control opioid abuse as of February 1, 2018.
Related: One in Three Americans Took Prescription Opioid Painkillers in 2015, Survey Says
Daily dosage limits will be based on the strength of the opioid and CVS pharmacists will require the use of immediate-release formulations of opioids before extended-release opioids are dispensed, lowering the risk of tolerance to the highly addictive drugs.
Related: Opioid Prescriptions Are Down But Not Enough, CDC Finds
CVS — which was the first large retail pharmacy chain to stop selling cigarettes in 2014 — is now hoping to help curb the opioid epidemic in the United States. One in three Americans, or 91.8 million Americans used opioid pills in 2015, according to a recent survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. More than 15,000 people died from prescription opioid overdose in 2015, according to the CDC.
With counseling on secure storage and disposal of opioid pills, the CVS pharmacists may be able to limit easy access to the pills. Five percent of adults surveyed told the National Institute on Drug Abuse researchers they took opioids without their doctor’s permission, often getting the prescription meds for free from friends or relatives. The CVS drug disposal collection program will expand to 1,550 units, with the addition of kiosks at 750 retail pharmacies nationwide, adding to 800 units previously donated to law enforcement.
In addition, CVS has pledged to increase its commitment to community health centers by bolstering contributions to medication-assisted treatment programs by $2 million.
The CVS announcement comes on the heels of a special publication released by the National Academy of Medicine, ""First, Do No Harm,"" which calls on the leadership and action of doctors to help reverse the “course of preventable harm and suffering from prescription opioids.”
“Simply restricting access to opioids without offering alternative pain treatments may have limited efficacy in reducing prescription opioid abuse,” said representatives from NIDA. But the move is a major part of the multi-dimensional solution needed to conquer opioid abuse and a long awaited step in the right direction.",0
"Microsoft founder Bill Gates has warned that over 30 million people will be dead within the next 15 years as a result of a biotechnologyattack.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Gates warned that the next worldwide epidemic will likely originate from terrorists using biotechnology to spread a dangerous “supervirus” around the globe.
“The next epidemic could originate on the computer screen of a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering to create a synthetic version of the smallpox virus … or a super contagious and deadly strain of the flu,” hetold the audience.
“Whether it occurs by a quirk of nature or at the hand of a terrorist, epidemiologists say a fast-moving airborne pathogen could kill more than 30 million people in less than a year. And they say there is a reasonable probability the world will experience such an outbreak in the next 10 to 15 years,” he warned.
Gates said the link between health security and international security is underestimated adding that governments are not paying enough attention to this threat. “We ignore the link between health security and international security at our peril.”
The absence of deadly epidemics in recent history shouldn’t lull the world into a false sense of security as such “doomsday scenarios” can occur. Gates reminded the audience of the scale of the 1918 flu pandemic which infected around 500 million people and claimed between 50-100 million lives according to various estimates.
“Most of the things we need to do to protect against a naturally occurring pandemic are the same things we must prepare for an intentional biological attack.”
The catastrophic consequences of a pandemic are comparable to nuclear war and climate change, Gates believes. “I view the threat of deadly pandemics right up there with nuclear war and climate change.”
He added that proper preparation could mitigate the risks. Such readiness includes the creation of a medical “arsenal of new weapons” to counter various epidemics. He said people need to “prepare for epidemics the way the military prepares for war,” such as, conducting exercises to understand viruses’ behavior. Last year, the US government conducted a similar experiment, releasing “gas” in the New York subway.
Reducing the time for creating a vaccine, surveillance and cooperation improvement are also among necessary requirements to tackle a pandemic, according to Gates. Lack of proper preparation can cost up to $570 billion annually, he added.
Gates’ speech at the Munich conference is not the first time the billionaire has voiced concerns about bioterrorism. In January, he warned about the potential dangers of bioterrorism during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Speaking to BBC radio in December 2016, Gates spoke about human vulnerabilities to fast-spreading diseases.",1

US defense official says drone strike targeted new ISIS official in charge of media and propaganda
The strike comes weeks after the US confirmed it had killed ISIS' spokesman
Washington (CNN)Just weeks after ISIS suffered a major loss when its chief spokesman was taken out in an air attack, the US announced it had killed his close associate in a strike.
The US targeted ISIS leader Wael Adel Salman, aka Abu Muhammed Furqan, in a September 7 airstrike, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said in a statement issued Friday.
The strike took out one of the very limited number of ISIS leaders who had ""direct access"" to Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, according to a US official. The US conducted the strike using a drone, hitting him on a motorcycle just outside a house in Raqqa, ISIS's self-declared capital, the official added.
Cook called Salman one of the ""most senior leaders"" in ISIS.
""He operated as the minister of Information for the terror organization and was a prominent member of its Senior Shura Council -- ISIL's leadership group,"" Cook added, using the government's preferred acronym for the terror group.

The US has now killed in the last two months two of the ""very few"" ISIS leaders with direct access to Baghdadi, the official said. Mohammad al-Adnani was killed in Syria in a US airstrike on August 30. He was thought to be in charge of external terror operations.
""Baghdadi's inner circle was already small, and it's getting smaller,"" the official added. Salman is assessed to have been one of the five most-senior officials in ISIS before he and Adnani were killed.
Cook said Salman was responsible for overseeing the production of ""terrorist propaganda videos showing torture and executions.""
An anti-ISIS group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, earlier told CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali that Salman was killed in a drone strike on September 7 in Raqqa, Syria. The group said Salman was responsible for ISIS propaganda and had been chosen to succeed Adnani.
Cook called Salman ""a close associate"" of Adnani.
Speaking in the UK last week, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter called Adnani ""one of the most lethal leaders within ISIL, who was actively planning to kill our civilians around the world.""
""The removal of ISIL's senior leaders degrades its ability to retain territory, and its ability to plan, finance and direct attacks inside and outside of the region,"" Cook added.",0
"The Pentagon have announced that the U. S. military have conducted an airstrike in Libya, targeting an Al-Qaeda-associated militant, but they are as yet unsure whether the mission succeeded or not.
“Last night, the US military conducted a counter-terrorism strike against an Al-Qaeda-associated terrorist in Libya. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,” a Pentagon spokesman said.
Warren could not specify where exactly the strike took place in Libya, and it was not immediately known if it was carried out by a drone or manned aircraft.
Warren also emphasized that there had been no US boots on the ground assisting the operation, Reuters reports.
UPDATE: Libyan Government says U. S air strike in Libya kills senior Algerian AQ leader Mokhtar #Belmokhtar pic.twitter.com/Edhsupskri
Meanwhile, Libya’s internationally recognized government, which only controls a portion of the devastated country, announced that the notorious Algerian guerrilla leader Mokhtar Belmokhtar was the actual target of the airstrike. “The Libyan government in the east of Libya confirms that the US fighter jets conducted air strikes last night in a mission which resulted in the death of the terrorist Belmokhtar,” the statement reads.
Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a one-eyed Algerian jihadi war veteran nicknamed “Mr. Marlboro,” became internationally known to special forces after orchestrating a deadly attack on an Algerian gas plant in January 2013, in which 800 people were taken hostage, 39 of whom were executed.
Belmokhtar, a former military commander of Al-Qaeda in Algeria, is also a noted kidnapper, smuggler, and weapons dealer. He began his extremist activities in 1991 in Afghanistan, joining the mujahedeen to fight against the Kabul government. He later joined the Islamist GIA and fought in the Algerian Civil War. He then served as commander in an Al-Qaeda cell based in Mali.
He was active in West Africa for at least a decade. Belmokhtar was convicted and sentenced to death in absentia twice under separate charges in Algerian courts: in 2007 for terrorism and in 2008 for murder.
In December, 2013 US State Department placed the Algerian extremist on a wanted list, placing an award of up to $5 million his head. Belmokhtar has been declared dead many times before, but the claims have never checked out.",1
"A severe solar storm with the potential to disrupt wireless communications, GPS and the electric power grid took scientists by surprise on St. Patrick’s Day – and has experts worried because the federal government’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) did not anticipate it.
“Our models showed we were just going to receive a glancing blow from this cloud coming off the sun,” Thomas Berger, the SPWC’s director, acknowledged in an interview with The Baltimore Sun. “We are now thinking we caught more than just a glancing blow.”
No major disruptions to communications, GPS or electricity were reported, but some minor fluctuations did occur on Tuesday afternoon, The Washington Post reported. The solar or geomagnetic storm has scientists concerned because its behavior did not match the models they use to predict such events.
On Sunday, the SPWC had predicted a storm would hit but expected it to be much weaker than it actually was. Berger’s team was taken by surprise when the storm intensified and arrived 15 hours earlier than expected on Tuesday. The storm lasted about 12 hours with lingering effects for 24 hours.
“This is still an inexact science and it’s difficult to gauge what the impacts will be,” Berger said.
History Shows It Will Happen Again
Some experts believe solar storms pose the greatest threat to the American power grid. A 1989 solar storm caused a widespread blackout in Quebec, and an even greater storm in 1921 knocked out the entire signal and switching system of the New York Central Railroad. The greatest solar storm on record, the Carrington Event in 1859, destroyed parts of the American telegraph system. It is believed that if an 1859-type of solar storm happened today, much if not all of the US would suffer a blackout.
A Carrington Event is a level G5 solar storm; the St. Patrick’s Day event was a level G4 outburst.
The latest episode is significant because it shows that scientists cannot always predict the severity of storms. For years, it was believed that scientists would be able to predict a catastrophic solar storm, if one were heading toward earth.
The major effect of the St. Patrick’s Day Solar Storm was to create an unusually bright display of the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis in the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere, including some parts of the U. S. – such as Nebraska and Massachusetts – that rarely see them.
A solar storm occurs when a solar flare creates a burst of charged particles from the sun. When the particles reach Earth, they can put a massive amount of electricity into the atmosphere that can overwhelm power grids and disrupt some communication systems, including GPS. One effect of such storms is to energize oxygen atoms which turn the atmosphere green and create Northern Lights.
The US government is so worried about solar storms that NASA is launching a new generation of satellites and space probes to study the phenomenon. The SWPC, which is run by the National Weather Service and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, says the satellites will help it track solar winds and solar storms and predict future solar storms.
The hope is that a new NASA satellite called Deep Space Climate Observatory or DSCOVR will serve as an alarm system for approaching solar storms and give the world advanced warning, The Sun reported. The current satellite doing that job, the Advanced Composition Explorer or ACE, is not designed to observe solar storms.
“The big mystery for us is why solar winds accelerate,” NASA scientist Nicky Fox told The Sun. “There are future missions that are going to provide us a lot of data that will help these [space weather forecasters] improve their models.”

Former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) slammed the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) scoring of Republican health care legislation, calling it “disgustingly wrong” and recommending that the office be abolished.
“They should abolish the Congressional Budget Office. It is corrupt. It is dishonest. It was totally wrong on ObamaCare by huge, huge margins,” Gingrich said to Fox’s Martha MacCallum on “The First 100 Days.
“I don’t trust a single word they have published and I don’t believe them.”
MacCallum pushed back at Gingrich, noting that the office’s director, Keith Hall, was appointed by congressional Republicans.
“People maybe misjudge what they’re supposed to do,” MacCallum said. “Their job is figure out whether or not this is something that can get through on reconciliation, right? Not to make a judgment about the whole bill.”
In response, Gingrich drew on his own experiences in the 1990s as Speaker.
“No. Let me be very clear. I helped balance the budget four straight times, the only time in your lifetime,” he said. “We fought the Congressional Budget Office every time.”
“When ObameCare came out, they used the architect of ObamaCare as their adviser on how to score ObamaCare. And their score, you go back and look at it, it is totally dishonest, disgustingly wrong, and that whole thing should be abolished.”
Gingrich suggested a replacement for a CBO by “putting out to bid and having three to five professional firms score these things.”
“Nobody has an exact score, it’s not possible,” he said, adding, “there are whole sections of this bill they haven’t scored.”
The CBO on Monday projected that the number of uninsured people would grow by 14 million in 2018 under the Republican ObamaCare replacement bill, with that number rising to 24 million by 2026.",1
"Oil, money and jobs: Venezuela is the third largest oil exporter to the US after Canada and Saudi Arabia and it controls the world's largest proven reserves of oil. While tankers from Venezuela bring in less than 10% of total US oil imports, disruption to those shipments would have ripple effects.
It could mean potentially higher gas prices for US consumers, and it would almost certainly disrupt the oil refineries that handle Venezuelan crude in states such as Louisiana and Texas, potentially leading to lost jobs in those areas. ""It's a sensitive issue for legislators"" from those states, said Eric Farnsworth, vice president at the Council of the Americas.
Russia and Iran
Disruption in the oil market will have an impact on the US economy and US businesses, many of which are invested in Venezuela -- including companies such as Goldman Sachs, which has bought Venezuelan bonds. ""People with direct investments will suffer tremendously,"" noted Andrea Murta, deputy director of the Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council.
Bad actors: Murta also said that ""an unstable Venezuela becomes an open door to actors that are not aligned with US interests, including Russia and Iran."" Murta and Farnsworth note that Caracas has already been serving as a conduit for anti-US interests, but if the country collapses, the prospects for mayhem increase.
CIA chief Mike Pompeo recently aired that concern on Fox News. ""The Cubans are there, the Russians are there, the Iranians, Hezbollah are there,"" Pompeo said Sunday. ""This is something that has a risk of getting to a very, very bad place, so America needs to take this very seriously.""
Regional upheaval: ""There's the destabilizing effect"" of a dictatorship developing on the borders of Colombia and Brazil, said Cynthia Aronson, who directs the Latin American program at the Wilson Center. Venezuela's instability is already sending thousands of people across its borders to escape economic hardship.

Its neighbors are struggling to deal with migrant flows and the economic and social issues that come with them. That upheaval could not only weaken US allies and trade partners, but redirect their focus from areas of shared interest with Washington, Murta said. ""It would change the region's priorities,"" she said. ""Instead of fostering prosperity or increasing trade, resources would be devoted to coping with Venezuela.""
Backward momentum: Since the early 1990s, the US approach to the Western Hemisphere has revolved around the idea that democracy is the only legitimate governing model. ""Venezuela, which had a vibrant if imperfect democracy, would be the first country since the Cold War to go backwards,"" said Farnsworth. ""It matters in that context.""
So what can the US do?
Send in the Marines?: Trump on Friday told reporters that, ""We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option for Venezuela."" He went on to say that, ""Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they're dying.""
No analysts CNN spoke with saw military action as a credible possibility. Some laughed. In Colombia on Monday, Pence himself tried to walk back the idea without flatly contradicting the President.
Colombian President to Pence: No US military intervention in Venezuela
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, meanwhile, said military action was ""unacceptable."" Indeed, the comment played right into Maduro's hands, allowing him to play up historical fears of US interference in the region.
""Anything that reinforces that narrative is a net negative,"" Farnsworth said, because it makes it harder for other countries to work with the US to deal with Caracas.
Sanctions: Pence said that ""we're looking at the full range of additional economic sanctions,"" which offers the US potentially huge leverage. But there are potential pitfalls.
So far, the US has levied sanctions on individuals, including Maduro, but they could be applied more broadly.
The harshest option would be to ban Venezuelan oil imports, but that would affect US jobs and energy prices. And since oil is also the country's main source of revenue and shortages mean that about 80% of Venezuelans now depend on government food handouts to eat, oil sanctions could hit ordinary people disproportionately hard.
Hunger, poverty
Already 93% of households live in food insecurity, according to Encovi, an annual survey of living conditions conducted by three Venezuelan universities. And only two out of every 10 Venezuelans tell Encovi they can get by without government help.
Trump could also curtail Venezuela's access to the US financial system -- but that's a move that would also hit Wall Street. ""Lots of firms purchased Venezuelan bonds,"" Aronson said. Sanctions ""would affect the ability of US banks and financial managers to buy and sell"" Venezuelan assets, she said.
In late July, a group of Democratic US lawmakers wrote Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to say that US has sanctioned Venezuela since 2015 but those steps ""have done nothing to improve the political situation in the country."" Instead, the government has used them to stoke nationalist resentment against the US.
The lawmakers noted polling data that showed a US oil embargo on Venezuela would be like ""political manna from heaven for Caracas,"" with large numbers of Venezuelans opposing US economic sanctions on the country's major source of income.
Venezuelan President's son threatens to seize White House with rifles
Talks and coalition building: Instead, the Democratic lawmakers urged Tillerson to support negotiations ""with respected external actors,"" such as Pope Francis, calling it ""the most viable path toward a peaceful solution.""
Murta said that the US has for years been trying to build a regional approach to Venezuela and that it's bearing fruit. ""Many countries are taking a more active role,"" she said, ""so it's not a US led effort anymore which is important,"" as it's harder for Venezuela to dismiss.
That's part of Pence's mission as he visits Colombia, Panama, Buenos Aries, Argentina and Chila on a week-long swing.
Economic measures: The US could stop sales of its lighter crude oil to Caracas. Venezuela mixes the lighter US crude with its own heavier oil to make it easier to sell. ""That would really complicate things for them,"" Farnsworth said.
Shame: The US has begun to talk about the Venezuelan government's criminal behavior, but it could do more, Farnsworth said. He listed, ""the massive corruption, the kleptocracy that's stealing the oil, the drug trafficking, the human rights issues, the fact that the US and other countries have repeatedly offered humanitarian assistance that's been rejected.""
That could increase the pressure on Caracas, he said, noting that, ""talking about the true nature of the regime is costless.""",0
"The US has offered to increase military aid to Israel by another $1.5 billion per year to ease tensions over the nuclear deal with Iran, according to reports.
Defense Secretary Ash Carter will next visit to Tel Aviv next week and it is expected that he will lay out a package of defense “benefits” in order to ease the heightened tension between Washington and Jerusalem over the nuclear deal.
The proposed increase would see Israel getting an additional squadron of F-35 fighter jets, funding for research and development of missile defense systems, and ammunition to replenish the stocks used in last year’s bombing of Gaza, Israeli sources told Jerusalem Post.
Under the current arrangement, Israel is receiving $3 billion a year, most of which is used to purchase US military hardware such as fighter jets and missile defense systems. Israeli and US officials have beendiscussing increasing the amount of aid to anywhere between $4.2 and $4.5 billion per year, sources familiar with the talks told the New York Times.
The new arrangement would go into effect in 2018 and last for a decade. Secretary Carter is expected to present the offer to his Israeli counterpart and good friend Moshe Ya’alon, Israeli sources said.
Netanyahu is reportedly reluctant to discuss US aid “at this juncture,” since that would mean giving tacit approval to the agreement the US and five other countries reached with Iran earlier this week.
The Israeli PM called the deal a “historic mistake” and may be hoping that the US Congress will refuse to endorse it before it goes into effect.
Iran and the “P5+1” group – including five permanent UN Security Council members and Germany –signed an agreement on Tuesday to curtail Iranian atomic research over the next 15 years in exchange for lifting nuclear-related sanctions and embargoes.
Israel hasalready negotiated the purchase of two F-35 squadrons, totaling 33 jets. The first delivery is scheduled for 2016. Much of the rumored increase in US aid may be in the form of additional F-35s, notorious for cost overruns and plagued by performance problems.
According to the Jerusalem Post, the Israeli Air Force is expected to hold a number of exercises with US and European countries for the first time in six years. They will be aimed at “dealing with long-range missile attacks and flights to distant countries.”
However, the paper’s sources noted the US would likely require assurances from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would not launch any military operations without first informing Washington.",1
"DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) — There's a new king in horse racing and it's Gun Runner.

""He just doesn't seem to get a hold of this racetrack, for whatever reason,"" jockey Mike Smith said. ""I hate to blame it on the track, but he's shown it time and time again. I keep trying to talk myself into it, that he's going to like it one day, but he just never did.""
Arrogate hasn't been the same horse since his dominant wins in the $12 million Pegasus World Cup and the $10 million Dubai World Cup earlier this year that made him the sport's richest thoroughbred with over $17 million in earnings.
The Dubai race was the last time Gun Runner lost. Since then, he's emerged stronger than ever with four consecutive victories.
""He's better today than he's ever been,"" said trainer Steve Asmussen, who won the Classic for the first time since 2007 with Curlin.
Arrogate was a slight 2-1 favorite over Gun Runner, with $1,420,233 bet on Arrogate to win — $132,416 more than on Gun Runner.
The Classic capped a wild weekend at Del Mar, playing host to the Breeders' Cup for the first time. Just two favorites won in 13 races — Mendelssohn in the $1 million Juvenile Turf on Friday and World Approval in the $2 million Mile on Saturday.
The biggest upset belonged to Bar of Gold in the $1 million Filly & Mare Sprint. She paid $135.40 to win at 60-1 odds in front of an announced crowd of 37,692.
The track had said attendance would be capped at 37,500 because of the smaller venue. Friday's total was 32,278.
There were three Europe-based winners: Mendelssohn, Wuheida in the $2 million Filly & Mare Turf, and Talismanic in the $4 million Turf.
New York-based trainer Chad Brown won two races: the $1 million Juvenile Fillies Turf with Rushing Fall and the $2 million Juvenile with 11-1 shot Good Magic.
Bob Baffert saddled a record four horses in pursuit of a record fourth straight win in the Classic. He finished 2-3 with Collected and West Coast, and was left to puzzle over another disappointing showing by Arrogate. His other horse, Mubtaahij, was eighth.
Arrogate broke a step slow and banged his left side on the starting gate.
""At the break when he ducked in and he had to gather him up, you just can't do that against these horses,"" Baffert said. ""But I notice when he goes around these turns he loses momentum. I can't really totally blame it on the track. He's so much better than that.""
Baffert was blanked with his 11 starters on the weekend, while Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien was 1 for 13. He trained Mendelssohn.
With Arrogate out of the running, a Baffert horse took up the chase, but it was Collected. He hounded Gun Runner in what became virtually a match race.
""I was feeling really good, actually,"" Geroux said. ""My horse was really comfortable, flopping his hair back and forth shows a sign he was relaxing for me while going quick. He's just a fresh horse. From there, I just tried to keep him as happy as I could.""
Collected took his best and last shot turning for home, but Gun Runner fended off the challenge and steadily widened his lead in deep stretch. Geroux and Asmussen discussed strategy earlier in the day after watching some early races.
""We wanted him away from the gate cleanly, in a nice rhythm,"" the trainer said. ""The confidence Florent has in the horse, the way the horse has been training coming into this race, I think letting him be who he is has put him on this stage and made him undoubtedly Horse of the Year.""
Gun Runner has 11 wins in 18 career starts and earnings of just less than $9 million.
War Story was fourth, followed by Arrogate and Gunnevera, Churchill, Mubtaahij, War Decree, Pavel and Win the Space.
— Good Magic won the $2 million Juvenile by 4 1/4 lengths, making him the winter favorite for next year's Kentucky Derby. Ridden by Jose Ortiz, Good Magic ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:43.34 and paid $25 to win at 11-1 odds. Trained by Brown, Good Magic earned his first win after finishing second in his first two career starts. Solomini, trained by Baffert, finished second. Bolt D'Oro, the 3-5 favorite, was third. Curlin, a former BC Classic winner, sired the winner and second place finisher.
— Trainer Peter Miller went 1-2 in the $1 million Turf Sprint with 30-1 shot Stormy Liberal winning by a head over 13-1 shot Richard's Boy. Stormy Liberal paid $62.40 to win.
— Talismatic rallied in the stretch to win the $4 million Turf by a half-length at 14-1 odds. The Britain-bred colt ran 1 1/2 miles in 2:26.19 and paid $30.20 to win. Defending champion Highland Reel — the 7-5 favorite — was third.
— Smith scored an upset — his leading 26th Cup win — in the $2 million Juvenile Fillies with 17-1 shot Caledonia Road.
— World Approval became the second favorite to win on the weekend, taking the $2 million Mile by 1 1/4 lengths and giving jockey John Velazquez his second Cup win in two days.
— Under Irad Oritz Jr., Bar of Gold ran seven furlongs in 1:22.63 and paid $135.40 to win the Filly & Mare Turf.
— Wuheida took the $2 million Filly & Mare Turf by a length and paid $24.40 at 11-1 odds.
— Roy H won the $1.5 million Sprint by a length under Kent Desormeaux, giving Miller his second victory on the weekend. The winner paid $11.80 at 9-2 odds.

"Killswitch Engage frontman Jesse Leach has shared a statement online after spending several days “mourning the current state of the world and this country”. Leach takes exception to the notion that the problem lies among average people and instead blames complex distraction tactics to further divide us by those at the very top.
His statement is incredibly well written and insightful. This is certainly the best analysis I have read on this topic from any musician thus far. Jesse Leach demonstrates a depth that is rare when coming from public figures in the entertainment industry.
“Knowing full well the insurmountable ridicule and abuse I may receive from this post (by those polarized in one direction or the other) I can not stay silent anymore. I realize my thoughts, concerns and observations may mean nothing to you. If that is the case simply stop reading. For those reading on, thank you and back to your regular unscheduled program of social media to resume in a minute or two.
– I can’t just take a “side” or allow a hashtag to define my grief (we all have our ways to mourn with respect). I have been contemplating and mourning the current state of the world and this country for days now. I still find it hard to find the words, but I wouldn’t be able to look myself in the mirror tomorrow if I didn’t attempt to formulate my thoughts and speak my mind and heart.
I mourn the murder of any human! The fact that we as a people use death as a political platform or an agenda is despicable. The denying of deep rooted inequality is also equally despicable! How can we foster progress and actual equality when no one is willing to listen to each other? We must be willing to be considerate and walk in one another’s shoes to find understanding. I don’t see much of that sadly, just division and disregard for one another.
What a sad, troubled and shockingly ignorant state of affairs we are caught in these days. The division between us as a people grows daily due tragic events paired alongside calculated disinformation and false flag or “wagging the dog” (look up these terms if you are not familiar and then examine certain current events that change over time). There is much outside of our history books and news reports to learn from. These days we are swallowing blindly what they feed us. Instead of uniting to stand against a common enemy (the ones in power that manipulate justice and care not for the common people). Instead we are divided against each other! While we bicker and fight over hashtags and who’s killing who, the clandestine dismantling of this country and the world economy continues unchecked.
Racism (among many other warped and conditioned hateful thinking) is alive and well people! It is being arrogantly displayed by many on both “sides” of the current issues. Yet we are distracted by social status, fantasy games and vanity glued to our phones like zombies. We swallow manufactured media as click bait conspiracies to occupy our minds. We have been warned for decades about these times from literature, to movies and songs. Yet here we are in the midst of yet another crucial downfall and all we are doing is infighting and pointing fingers at each other. When in fact the blame lies upon those in high “authority.” Those very few at the top who oversee the passing and amending of laws, the controlling of wealth and the distribution of power ARE the divisors and dictators of the system.
We have been conditionally dumbed down, divided and controlled. This is “idiocracy” in full effect, but the vast majority can’t see it! We have been indoctrinated and brain washed so cleverly, patiently and precisely that the vast majority are completely unaware of the state of emergency. We lash out against one another in fear and anger. Anyone trying to make a change and speak out is violently and or verbally struck down by an opposing view. It’s ether that or threatened, ridiculed or simply… silenced in death.
How many more of “US” will die before we realize the truth has been disguised?
How long do we allow those in control to manipulate us, humiliate us, steal from us and kill us like pawns in their game of power? There has got to be a better way. There has got to be a radical change. Sadly I fear the worst as it seems most are too far gone, trapped in the “matrix” as it were.
The only thing I can offer is my personal action. My lyrics in my music, my choices, the companies I support or boycott with money. The effort I will put forth to be understanding, compassionate and yes, loving when I have the strength. My faith is, that there is enough good with us all to begin to heal and help one another (even in small simple ways).
For those of you who believe in God I urge you to pray. For those of you who gather in protest and activism do so in peace. For those of you in uniform show honor and control. For those of you who have compassion and charity to give, give it in abundance. We are facing troubling times and I feel it will only get worse before it improves. In the meantime pause and think before you speak or act and ask yourself “am I a part of the problem or a part of the solution.” You can control and change the way you think and act.
Think about this, if only for a moment.
I am just a man trying to find understanding and do the best that I can to help in anyway. I will continue to strive to write lyrics and songs for ALL of us. I will strive to be an instrument of light and hope in this world of darkness (albeit a flawed, sarcastic, head case of an instrument)….but It’s all I have and all I can offer at present.
I am heartbroken for us all but I won’t give up on trying to make this world a better place one little tiny effort after another.
Be good to one another

WF| Liberals continue saying that welfare fraud in not a problem.
Each person on food stamps benefits average $125.35 per person per month, costing $74.1 BILLION in 2014 for the approximate 45.6 million people receiving the benefits.
Fraud at a rate of even less than 5% equates to billions of wasted dollars.
The method most food stamp fraudsters use is filing a claim for the food stamp and then trading their food stamp cards for less than face value for cash.
Recently in Baltimore, 14 people were arrested in raids that amounted to $16 MILLION in food stamp fraud. They have now been indicted for the crime.
[Retail operators] around Baltimore have been charged in connection to a huge food stamp and wire fraud scheme.
The indictments allege the retailers received more than $16 million in federal payments for transactions in which they did not provide any food, a fraud scheme commonly known as “food stamp trafficking.”
As a result these transactions, they allegedly obtained more than $16,482,270 in EBT deposits for transactions in which food sales never occurred or were substantially inflated and split the proceeds with food stamp recipients.
Here are some of the names of the defendants:
Walayat Khan, 36, of Reisterstown
Shaheen Tasewar Hussain, 60, of Ellicott City
Mulazam Hussain, 54, of Windsor Mill
Mahmood Hussain Shah, 57, of Catonsville
Muhammad Rafiq, 58, of Reisterstown
Mohammad Shafiq, 50, of Gwynn Oak, Maryland; and his daughter,
Alia Shaheen, 24, of Baltimore
Mohammad Irfan, 59, of Nottingham
Muhammad Sarmad, 40, of Nottingham
Kassem Mohammad Hafeed, a/k/a Kassam Mohammad Hafeed, 51, of Baltimore
Did you happen to see a trend reading through the names? That’s right, 14 of them are Muslims. I’m curious to know where those millions of dollars went – did they go to terrorist groups?
The money wasn’t used for their businesses. They were living in filthiness and the restaurants involved were immediately shut down due to the gross conditions within.
The food was spoiled, the places were grungy, and drugs were also found on the premises.
I think that the government needs to do a rehaul on the benefits system, as well as come down harder on those who are committing fraud.",1
"A grand plan once spearheaded by Jared Kushner to rescue the biggest deal in his career by razing a Fifth Avenue skyscraper and building luxury apartments in its place is all but dead, the co-owner of the building said Tuesday.
The comments from Vornado Realty Trust CEO Steven Roth suggest that Kushner's most ambitious purchase as a young would-be real estate mogul will continue to bleed money — tens of millions a year — as a deadline for repayment of the giant mortgage on the office building nears. Kushner sold his personal interest in the tower, the family's flagship property and headquarters, before joining the White House as a senior adviser to his father-in-law, President Donald Trump.
Kushner bought the famed aluminum-clad skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue for a record $1.8 billion a decade ago when he was the 26-year-old CEO of Kushner Cos., at the time mostly known for thousands of garden apartments in suburbia. Then he almost lost the building to lenders. Roth swept in with a rescue plan in 2011, offering cash in exchange for a big ownership stake.
The outlook for the office section of the building has not improved lately. Its 1.4 million square feet of office space is nearly a third empty and the Kushners and Roth must pay back a $1.2 billion mortgage in a little over a year.
While the clock is ticking for the Kushners, the opposite is true for Roth.
The Kushner Cos. is privately held and small compared with the company that Roth heads, the publicly traded Vornado Realty Trust, which has stockpiled hundreds of millions in cash. Roth can afford to wait until the last minute and, some analysts say, perhaps grab a bigger ownership stake in any crisis.
""The worse this thing turns out,"" said Joe McBride, a project manager at research firm Trepp LLC, ""the higher the chance that Vornado can take ownership of the property at lower entry.""
In a conference call with Vornado investors on Tuesday, Roth described the building as ""overleveraged,"" meaning it owes too much. Referring to the Kushner plans to tear down the building, he said ""it's likely that those are not feasible"" and that the building will probably remain offices.
Vornado had no other comment for this article. A spokesman for the Kushner Cos. did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The Kushner Cos. had hoped to construct a tower where the Mad Men-era offices now stand, a gleaming building about twice as high and featuring luxury condominiums on most of floors.
The plan looked impressive on paper, with drawings by the late architect Zaha Hadid. But Roth reportedly has never embraced the concept. Among other problems, it would require billions of dollars from outside investors and would allow corporate tenants to leave the building when their leases run out so it can be demolished, leaving less money to pay the bills.
The hunt for billions has turned up nothing so far and, given Roth's comment, it looks likely the Kushners may have to reverse course, leaving the offices at 666 Fifth Avenue as they are.
The family had been negotiating with Anbang Insurance, a Chinese company with close ties to the ruling Communist party there. But Democrats in Congress and good-government watchdogs complained that China could use the investment as leverage with the White House, and negotiations were called off in March.
Talks with a Qatari billionaire have also ended, a Kushner Cos. spokesman recently confirmed. And Bloomberg has reported the Kushners have also gotten nowhere with other potential partners, including a South Korean government fund, a French billionaire and a Saudi investor.
Meanwhile, the finances of the building have only gotten worse.
When Jared Kushner bought it on the eve of the financial crisis, 6 percent of the offices were empty. Now 30 percent are empty as leases are allowed to run out and tenants leave. Kushner long ago sold the retail space at the bottom of the building, but the interest rate on the $1.2 billion mortgage for the offices has steadily climbed from 3 percent to 5.5 percent in just four years.
Adding to the troubles: The luxury condo market has shifted recently, undermining a key assumption behind the raze-and-rebuild plan. There is a glut of luxury apartments in Manhattan now, prices are falling and the units are taking longer to sell.
Looming above all this is a deadline. Lenders are expecting their $1.2 billion back, plus another $200 million in other charges, in February 2019 — 15 months away. If they don't get the money, they can foreclose on the property.
One idea is to sell the offices, but that might not be a good solution. Jed Reagan, a commercial real estate analyst at Green Street Advisors, doesn't think the offices are worth as much as the debt. And fixing up the offices to make them more appealing could cost a lot, too.
""This office building has a lot vacancies now, and there is quite a bit of deferred capital maintenance,"" Reagan said. ""Even if you stick with the offices as is, that's going to take money to attract tenants.""
Just how much money the Kushners have to spend on the building is not clear because they don't release financial figures to the public. And their recent business moves leave a cloudy picture.
They have been buying more properties lately, suggesting they have cash or at least access to lenders. The Kushner Cos. and two partners reportedly paid $340 million for the former Jehovah's Witnesses headquarters near the Brooklyn Bridge over a year ago. Four months later, the same group bought a nearby parking lot for $345 million. Then, in August, the company paid $190 million for garden apartments near Princeton, New Jersey.
The Kushners have borrowed heavily in some deals, though, and they nearly always bring partners to invest with them, so it's not certain how much has been pulled from the pockets of the family business.
No one is guessing about the resources available to Roth, though, and that he can use a crisis to his advantage, as he did in 2011 when he made his big move on the Fifth Avenue building.
Back then falling rents had sent the building's assessed value plunging, a reserve fund set up to pay interest on the mortgage was running dry and lenders had just hired a ""special servicer"" in anticipation of a default.
Roth pounced, getting a 49.5 percent stake in the office building above the retail stores for $80 million, along with other financial commitments. He also got a bit of a bonus. The $80 million would be treated as ""preferred equity,"" which meant it would earn interest like a loan, according to a Credit Suisse report.
The rate was 11 percent, remarkable at a time when borrowing rates had plunged to their lowest in decades.
On Monday, Vornado reported that it had it took in $1.5 billion in rent and fees from dozens of its properties in the first nine months of this year. Its cash holdings for an emergency or a big deal stand at $1.3 billion.
""They are a very patient poker player,"" said Alex Goldfarb , a managing director of Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ""And when they get the right opportunity, they will act.""",0

"(Before It's News)
Two herpes simplex viruses infect primates from unknown evolutionary depths. In modern humans these viruses manifest as cold sores (HSV1) and genital herpes (HSV2).
Unlike HSV1, however, the earliest proto-humans did not take HSV2 with them when our ancient lineage split from chimpanzee precursors around 7 million years ago. Humanity dodged the genital herpes bullet – almost.
Somewhere between 3 and 1.4 million years ago, HSV2 jumped the species barrier from African apes back into human ancestors – probably through an intermediate hominin species unrelated to humans. Hominin is the zoological ‘tribe’ to which our species belongs.
This is a cast of a P. boisei skull, used for teaching at Cambridge University

Now, a team of scientists from Cambridge and Oxford Brookes universities believe they may have identified the culprit: Paranthropus boisei, a heavyset bipedal hominin with a smallish brain and dish-like face.
In a study published today in the journal Virus Evolution, they suggest that P. boisei most likely contracted HSV2 through scavenging ancestral chimp meat where savannah met forest – the infection seeping in via bites or open sores.
Hominins with HSV1 may have been initially protected from HSV2, which also occupied the mouth. That is until HSV2 “adapted to a different mucosal niche” say the scientists. A niche located in the genitals.
Close contact between P. boisei and our ancestor Homo erectus would have been fairly common around sources of water, such as Kenya’s Lake Turkana. This provided the opportunity for HSV2 to boomerang into our bloodline.
The appearance of Homo erectus around 2 million years ago was accompanied by evidence of hunting and butchery. Once again, consuming “infected material” would have transmitted the virus – only this time it was P. boisei being devoured.
“Herpes infect everything from humans to coral, with each species having its own specific set of viruses,” said senior author Dr Charlotte Houldcroft, a virologist from Cambridge’s Department of Archaeology.
“For these viruses to jump species barriers they need a lucky genetic mutation combined with significant fluid exchange. In the case of early hominins, this means through consumption or intercourse – or possibly both.”
“By modelling the available data, from fossil records to viral genetics, we believe that Paranthropus boisei was the species in the right place at the right time to both contract HSV2 from ancestral chimpanzees, and transmit it to our earliest ancestors, probably Homo erectus.”
When researchers from University of California, San Diego, published findings suggesting HSV2 had jumped between hominin species, Houldcroft became curious.
While discussing genital herpes over dinner at Kings College, Cambridge, with fellow academic Dr Krishna Kumar, an idea formed. Kumar, an engineer who uses Bayesian network modelling to predict city-scale infrastructure requirements, suggested applying his techniques to the question of ancient HSV2.
Houldcroft and her collaborator Dr Simon Underdown, a human evolution researcher from Oxford Brookes, collated data ranging from fossil finds to herpes DNA and ancient African climates. Using Kumar’s model, the team generated HSV2 transmission probabilities for the mosaic of hominin species that roamed Africa during “deep time”.
“Climate fluctuations over millennia caused forests and lakes to expand and contract,” said Underdown. “Layering climate data with fossil locations helped us determine the species most likely to come into contact with ancestral chimpanzees in the forests, as well as other hominins at water sources.”
Some promising leads turned out to be dead ends. Australopithecus afarensis had the highest probability of proximity to ancestral chimps, but geography also ruled it out of transmitting to human ancestors.
Ultimately, the researchers discovered the key player in all the scenarios with higher probabilities to be Paranthropus boisei. A genetic fit virally who was found in the right places to be the herpes intermediary, with Homo erectus – and eventually us – the unfortunate recipients.
“Once HSV2 gains entry to a species it stays, easily transferred from mother to baby, as well as through blood, saliva and sex,” said Houldcroft.
“HSV2 is ideally suited to low density populations. The genital herpes virus would have crept across Africa the way it creeps down nerve endings in our sex organs – slowly but surely.”
The team believe their methodology can be used to unravel the transmission mysteries of other ancient diseases – such as human pubic lice, also introduced via an intermediate hominin from ancestral gorillas over 3 million years ago.",1
"GE and WP Brand Studio are partnering to put the lens of industry on Mobile World Congress with special reports live from Barcelona. Minds + Machines: Speaking Industry is a partner program, made possible by GE. The Washington Post newsroom is not involved in content production.
By Todd Wasserman
The 2016 Mobile World Congress provided a glimpse of the emerging industrial Internet and the tantalizing prospect of 5G, the high-speed wireless network, but the industry will have to wait a few years for full implementation.
While AT&T and Verizon, among others, are testing 5G this year, AT&T vice chairman and CEO Ralph de la Vega said the “commercial start date” for 5G for industrial use will probably be in 2018, and more like 2020 for “the time it picks up speed.”
Looking ahead to 2020, the GSMA (Groupe Speciale Mobile Association) also estimates another 1 billion new customers will tap into the mobile Internet. For such customers, the future looks rosy indeed—de la Vega even promised that the industrial application of mobile will cure cancer. However, some headaches remain–literal ones in some cases.
5G and the rise of smart machines
Yet when it comes to overall improvement, nothing can rival 5G. The so-called fifth-generation mobile network will offer speeds of 1 Gbit per second, which is 10 times what 4G offers.
In a roundtable discussion, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that 5G will likely usher in an age of smart machines. “4G was much more about us and our phones,” he said. “5G will be a balance between us and the machines, and the machines will outnumber us 10 to one.”
AT&T’s de la Vega said that while 5G provides faster speeds, the key difference will be in latency. “That allows you to make real-time decisions on a real-time basis,” he said. “If you’re driving in a car, or worse yet, you’re having an experience in an autonomous car, you want to make sure that has low latency. If it’s going to make a decision to turn left or right, that’s got to be done in real time.”
Among other possible industrial uses, De la Vega foresees a day when Internet-connected sensors the size of a grain of sand will detect cancer in the blood. “I really personally believe before too long cancer is going to be a manageable disease,” he said.
For proponents of industrial wearable computing devices, the future looked similarly promising. In another panel, Stuart Carlaw, chief research officer of ABI Research, quoted stats showing huge room for growth in the category. Last year, some 135 million wearables shipped, but just 15 million were for enterprise users.
By 2021, there will be 390 million units shipped, 102 million of which will be for enterprise use. From now until 2021, growth for enterprise-focused wearables will outstrip comparative growth in consumer-focused wearables by 300 percent, he said.
Companies are using wearables for a variety of applications. In a pilot program with an unnamed utility company, employees are using Vuzix Corporation’s smart glasses with augmented reality to “see” where underground pipes are laid and avoid having to dig more than they need to reach them. An automaker is employing Germany’s ProGlove to help workers avoid making mistakes in the factory. Another firm is using Atheer Labs’s smart glasses to link to a desk-bound expert who helps workers identify and fix corrosion in pipes.
While the utility of such devices is clear, the companies admit that the ROI isn’t sometimes. Lance Anderson, vice president of enterprise sales for Vuzix, said that’s partially a result of using “old paradigms” to measure wearables’ success but also a reflection of the technology’s early stages and on-the-ground use of data. “It’s about what’s available today and what you can do today with your current data structure,” he said. “No one’s in a green field. No one gets to completely start over. You have to use these current wearables in your existing operation.”
One possible hitch is that AR and especially VR headsets might cause headaches in workers. There was some talk of such a side effect with Google Glass, but it’s too soon to tell if industrial headsets might cause such issues. Anderson said the solution in part is to be stingy with the data you present on the devices. “It’s about presenting the right information at the right time and no more,” he said. “You don’t want to oversaturate people.”
Some other aspects of industrial wearables may help ease the pain. In particular, wearables can help the estimated 110 million “deskless professionals” to do their jobs better with fewer accidents, said Vishal Shah VP of business development for Atheer Labs. All the more reason that, for some, 5G can’t come fast enough.

"“We hoped to determine if, in fact, the South African examples could be linked with the Australian examples, as it would give us additional insight into the evolutionary history and significance of these unusual forms,” said Dorothy Z. Oehler, senior scientist, Planetary Science Institute, Tuscon Arizona. “Maud (M. Walsh, professor of plant, environmental and soil sciences, Louisiana State University) first discovered the lenticular forms in the Kromberg formation and sent us some samples and we all collaborated on the interpretation. We did isotopic analysis along with comparison of the South African and Australian examples in terms of their morphologies and the types of rocks and geologic settings in which the fossils occurred.”
These fossils all occur in sedimentary rocks — chert — in what was once shallow water. And, according to the researchers, it appears that the samples from two sites in Australia and one in South Africa are related.
“Many people believe that the Kaapvaal Craton of Southern Africa and the Pilbara Craton of Australia formed a single continent at that time,” said Christopher H. House, professor of geosciences and director, Penn State Astrobiology Research Center. “But we really don’t know.”

These microfossils are unusual not only because they are so old, appearing in the geologic record about a billion years after the Earth formed 4.6 billion years ago, but because they are large, complex, plankton-like and autotrophs — organisms that can turn inorganic elements into organic material.
Familiar fossils such as trilobites were alive just 200 million years ago and first appeared 500 million years ago. The lenticular organisms appeared 3,450 million years ago, spread at least from where Australia was then to South Africa and then disappeared from the fossil record. They are larger and more elaborate than any other organism existing around at that time.
“These fossils don’t appear to relate to anything on the Earth that we know of,” said House. “They seem to be an experiment in adaptation that does not leave a lineage.”
The researchers analyzed the fossils to determine the isotopic relationship between carbon 12 and carbon 13, two isotopes of carbon that exist in everything but whose ratios can indicate organic material. They used Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy, a process where an ion beam kicks ions off the surface of a substance so that those ions can be identified.
“When the carbon isotope data came back we were excited,” said Oehler. “It helped to confirm the biogenicity of the South African forms and told us that the organic microfossils from the three deposits were likely to represent organisms that were biologically related.”",1

"HOUSTON — A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that ExxonMobil Corp should pay a $19.95 million penalty for pollution from its Baytown, Texas, refining and chemical plant complex between 2005 and 2013.
U. S. District Court Judge David Hittner issued the ruling in a citizen lawsuit brought under the U.S. Clean Air Act by two environmental groups, Environment Texas and the Sierra Club.
Environment Texas welcomed the decision in the long-running suit, which was first filed in 2010.
""We think it might be the largest citizen suit penalty in U. S. history,"" said Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas. ""It definitely means it pays not to pollute.""
Exxon said it would consider its legal options and may appeal the ruling.
""We disagree with the court's decision and the award of any penalty,"" Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said in an emailed statement. ""As the court expressed in its decision, ExxonMobil's full compliance history and good faith efforts to comply weigh against assessing any penalty.""
The suit was filed under a provision of the Clean Air Act that allows citizens to sue when regulators have failed to stop pollution. The two groups had contended the penalty could run as high as $573 million, but had only sought $41 million.
In a 101-page decision, Hittner ruled there had been 16,386 days of violations and 10 million pounds (4.5 million kg) of pollutants had been released in violation of operating permits issued to Exxon for the Baytown complex.
""The court finds given the number of days of violations and the quantitative amount of emissions released as a result, the seriousness factor weighs in favor of the assessment of a penalty,"" he wrote.
The decision comes about a year after the Fifth U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals determined Hittner had errored in a 2014 ruling assessing Exxon's liability for pollution from the refinery, chemical plant and olefins plant in the Baytown complex in the eastern suburbs of Houston.

The Fifth Circuit Court sent the case back to Hittner to reassess Exxon's liability.
The Baytown complex, which includes the second largest refinery in the United States, is regulated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), which had fined Exxon $1.4 million for pollution. Hittner deducted that amount in determining the penalty.
The penalty will be paid to the federal government. Hittner said Exxon was liable for legal fees incurred by the two environmental groups.",0
"Israel has successfully test fired its Arrow 3 ballistic missile shield that has received extensive funding and technical assistance from the U. S.
The Israeli Ministry of Military Affairs said that the upgraded “Arrow 3″ ballistic missile system passed a full interception test on Thursday.
The Defense Ministry reported that it is intended to deter long-range weapons held by the likes of Iran and Hezbollah.
RT reports: The Arrow system is a joint project between IAI and the US aviation giant Boeing. Each Arrow 3 missile costs about $2.2 million, according to Haaretz. American officials were present at the test on Thursday, as the latest system hit targets in space, meant to simulate a nuclear or chemical weapon that Iran, Syria or Hezbollah could potentially launch, according to the Israelis.
The missile flies into the atmosphere, where it splits up into ‘kamikaze’ satellites that lock onto and eliminate targets.
Thursday’s success represents another boost of confidence for the Arrow system. Another attempt was made last year, but was unsuccessful, with designers alluding to a faulty deployment of the target.
Arrow 3 is the top-tier system in Israel’s missile shield arsenal. The country’s lowest-tier defense is the short-range Iron Dome interceptor. Next year Israel will present David’s Sling – a system intended to intercept mid-range targets.
Although this summer’s nuclear deal with Iran has somewhat calmed nerves in the region, Israel – which fought a bloody war against Hamas in Gaza in 2014 – is continuing a policy of viewing its regional neighbors with suspicion.

"In a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court today, the eight justices ruled in favor of revoking the Church of Scientology’s tax-exempt status in the United States. Under the ruling, Scientology will still be able to operate as a business but no longer as a non-profit religious organization.
The case was brought forward by the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division after concluding a two-year-long investigation into the inner workings of Scientology. The investigation, along with an extensive audit, found the group to be a “criminal operation with a sole purpose of making money”. The eight justices agreed with the IRS and its findings that Scientology was neither a religion or fell under the guidelines of a non-profit charitable organization.
CI Special Agent, Tom Downey, worked closely with IRS Chief Counsel Criminal Tax Attorneys during the course of the investigation.
“If private schools had similar prices to the courses in Scientology, students would receive the absolute highest level of education by the top educators in the country,” Downey said. “But in reality, based on the ridiculously high cost of Scientology, there is no school out there that even exists. The best schools in this country charge a fraction of the exorbitant amounts of money that Scientology charges its members.”
Paul Horner, a spokesperson for Scientology, told ABC News the ruling is “discrimination based on religious beliefs”.
“In a free country, such as ours, it amazes me that over ten million Scientologists can have their beliefs trampled on like this,” Horner said. “The Church of Scientology is working hard to make this world a better place, constructing more buildings and ships and other really neat stuff, and now, most of that will have to be put on hold because of a few religious bigots.”
For years, Scientology’s claim of ten million followers has been widely disputed. In 2011, former editor, and longtime Scientology foe, Tony Ortega, wrote the following in The Village Voice:
“According to the latest survey, the total number of people who identify as Scientologists is just 25,000 in this country of more than 300 million human beings.”
Scientology teaches that 75 million years ago an evil galactic overlord named Xenu, ruler of a Galactic Confederacy, decided to tackle overpopulation by rounding up 13.5 trillion people in DC-8-like spacecraft, flying them to Earth (then known as Teegeeack), dropping them in the volcanoes of Hawaii and vaporizing them with hydrogen bombs.
Their spirits, known as thetans, attached themselves to humans at the dawn of man, and according to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard is the root cause of all our fears, confusion and problems. For humans to reach a clear state, thetans must be removed from the body through therapy sessions, known within Scientology as auditing.
Scientology adherents must work through eight stages of auditing over a period of many years to reach this clear state, each of which costs thousands of dollars to partake in. It was these costs that the court took issue with, ruling that they far outstrip average course fees for educational establishments.
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News she lost her family because of Scientology’s disconnection policy.
“I was born into Scientology,” Bradley said. “When I turned seventeen I began to question some of their beliefs. My family, who are all members, told me to stay quiet, but it was too late and I was excommunicated from the church. Scientology’s upper management told me I was no longer able to see or talk to my family ever again,” Bradley said. “It broke my heart, I couldn’t even say goodbye to them. They were told by Scientology if they had any communication with me that they would be excommunicated too. My family chose Scientology over me.” Holding back tears Bradley says, “I just hope my family is proud of me, all that I’m doing with my life and everything I’m doing to help the homeless. I wish more than anything to see them one day; I love and miss them so much.”
Downey told reporters that Scientology spends tens of millions of dollars every year doing what no other religious non-profit organization does.
“The money is used to harass former members, coerce abortions, to secure their International base so people can’t escape, child abuse, forcing members to disconnect from family and friends who aren’t Scientologist friendly, and to litigate to death anyone who opposes them,” Downey said. “Years ago, the Cult Awareness Network was an organization that provided information on groups that it considered to be cults. After years of litigation with Scientology and being forced into bankruptcy, it is now a Scientology run enterprise. Over the years Scientology has also put many government officials and politicians in their pocket.”
For years, the Church of Scientology often pointed to their tax-exempt status as proof that it is a recognized religious entity in the United States. And there’s no disputing that tax-exempt status has been a huge boon to the Scientology industry. With such few members, but billions in real estate holdings, the Church of Scientology has been called “the most famous small business in the world,” with its tax exempt status saving the Church an estimated $20 million a year on property taxes alone.
Roberto Sigmond of Amnesty International told ABC News that revoking the Church of Scientology’s tax-exempt status in the United States is a huge win.

“From all the deaths Scientology has caused over the years to its phony drug rehabilitation program, this is a great day for anyone that believes in human rights.”
After originally being recognized as a tax-exempt religious organization in 1957, Scientology’s tax-exempt status was lost in a 1967 IRS audit. As part of the effort to regain tax exemption during the late 1970s, Scientologists repeatedly infiltrated the IRS, copying large numbers of documents and at one point placing an electronic bugging device in an IRS conference room. These actions took place within a program code-named Operation Snow White. Eleven high-ranking Scientologists, including Hubbard’s wife Mary Sue Hubbard, were sentenced to time in prison for acts surrounding this operation. L. Ron Hubbard himself was named as an unindicted co-conspirator as investigators could not link him to the crimes.
The United States is not the first country to revoke Scientology’s tax exemption. In October of last year, a Dutch court revoked Scientology’s status as a “public welfare institution” and the tax exemption that goes along with it.
Janine Pieters, reporting in the NL Times, said the court ruledthat sales of Scientology’s coursesand therapysessions are aimed at profit-making and that it does not therefore belong on the tax authorities charity list.
Beginning April 6th, 2016, The Church of Scientology will no longer receive tax exemption in the United States. Attorneys for Scientology have 30 days to appeal the case, although it is not yet clear whether they will or not.
UPDATE 4/28/16: The Church of Scientology has regained their tax-exempt status within the United States. Contact your local Representative to complain and have it removed.",1
"Facebook to use unmanned solar powered drones to provide internet access to remote places.
It looks like Facebook is in a position to take the next giant step in moving the digital age of the internet forward.
The Huge drones will travel the skies bringing connectivity to people below.
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook aims to connect the world to the internet and hopefullytoFacebook.
The initiative will empower knowledge and jobs to 100’s of millions of people in the world.
Facebook CEO said in his blog : As part of our Internet.orgeffort to connect the world, we’ve designed unmanned aircraft that can beam internet access down to people from the sky. Today, I’m excited to share that we’ve successfully completed our first test flight of these aircraft in the UK.
The final design will have a wingspan greater than a Boeing 737 but will weigh less than a car. It will be powered by solar panels on its wings and it will be able to stay at altitudes of more than 60,000 feet for months at a time.
Aircraft like these will help connect the whole world because they can affordably serve the 10% of the world’s population that live in remote communities without existing internet infrastructure.
Zuckerberg and Schroepfer, who delivered the technical keynote at the conference, spoke about the efforts that the firm is making to make the world more connected.These include Oculus, the face-hugging augmented reality system, and a machine with enough artificial intelligence nous to answer questions about The Lord of the Rings.
“We have a chance to connect everyone in the world. Facebook can build systems that are more human, more personalized and more intelligent than anything that has come before,” said Facebook in summary mode.“The technologies that were discussed today will help build tools and services that better serve people and move the world forward.”
Facebook-backed Internet.org said that there is great potential in the unconnected, suggesting that increasing internet access could create 140 million jobs, take 160 million people out of poverty, and save the lives of hundreds of thousands of children.
Currently, the firm added, only a third of the global population who could join Facebook has access to the internet.",1
"Saturday's well-hyped fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor may well have lived up to the advance billing.
Mayweather defeated McGregor when the referee ended the bout in the 10th of 12 possible rounds in Las Vegas.
“I guaranteed everybody this fight wouldn’t go the distance,” Mayweather told the New York Daily News. “He’s a lot better than I thought he was he used a lot of angles. … That was our game plan was to take our time … let him shoot all his heavy shots early.”
The most unusual megafight in years went longer and was more competitive than many expected when an unbeaten, five-division world champion boxer took on a mixed martial artist making his pro boxing debut.
While McGregor (0-1) had the T-Mobile Arena crowd behind his improbable quest, Mayweather (50-0) survived a rough beginning and gradually took control. He brutalized McGregor in the 10th, landing numerous shots and chasing McGregor around the ring until referee Robert Byrd saved the Irishman and stopped the fight.
The start of the fight was delayed while Showtime PPV consulted with various TV systems around the country and tried to resolve some transmission issues.
That was according to a Showtime spokesman, who said the fight would be delayed ""a little bit.""
Conor McGregor was calm and confident in his televised pre-fight interview, telling Showtime's Jim Gray that he would “paint a beautiful picture” in his fight against heavily favored Mayweather.
“I'm going to go out and be myself -- free, spontaneous, creative -- and paint a beautiful picture,"" he said. ""I see me truly outclassing this man and putting him to sleep.""
McGregor said he thought he weighed ""about 170"" pounds after rehydrating from Friday's weigh-in, where he was 153. Mayweather weighed in at 149 1/2.
Mayweather was guaranteed $100 million for his night's work, and could make double that if the pay-per-view buys were as strong as expected. McGregor's guarantee with the Nevada State Athletic Commission was $30 million.
Bookies had faced taking a big loss because McGregor tickets outnumbered Mayweather tickets by as much as 18-1 at some books. But the big bets started coming in Thursday on Mayweather and at the William Hill chain of sports books 74 percent of the money on straight bets was on Mayweather.
There were a handful of million-dollar bets on Mayweather, with three coming in just hours before the fight. The biggest reported bet on McGregor was $100,000.
The fight was shaping up to be the biggest bet fight ever, breaking the mark of about $50 million set in Mayweather's win over Manny Pacquiao in 2015.

"US Power Grids In Danger New World Order. What is being done to protect us and is it too little, too late? Are Americans prepared for a long-term power outage? “The question is not will it happen? But when will it happen?” Said Judge Jeanine Pirro who will host a one hour long special on power grid dangers. She pointed out that before 9/11, Americans had never envisioned such an attack taking place. Judge Jeanine discussed the alarming situation with former CIA director James Woolsey and former Navy seal Christopher Heben.
Wolseley worries that the government officials in charge of protecting the power grid have buried “their heads in the sand.” “If you take out the electrical system, everything else goes down, too. You have 18 critical infrastructures in the country, and 17 of them depend on electricity. So you lose your communication system. You lose transportation. You lose your bank teller system for getting money. Nothing works,” he explained.
According to a study by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the entire US power grid could be shut down in a matter of minutes through a small-scale attack on nine of the country’s 55,000 electric transmission substations. the danger was exposed late last year when an unknown group of people were able to successfully penetrate a San Jose, California power substation, strategically cutting fiber cables and then firing over 100 rounds of ammunition into 10 Transformers. The attack highlighted how even a low-tech, small-scale attack could potentially take down an entire grid.
The 2012 report by the National Research Council, written for the Department of Homeland Security, said that the “greatest vulnerability in the event of a terrorist physical attack on the power system will likely be securing needed replacements of high-voltage transformers.” It said restoring power “could take weeks, months, or even longer.” Could this be the beginning of a new world order? How are you prepared for this “attack.”",1
"It’s very annoying when you read an excellent book, and then you watch it’s movie, and it doesn’t live up to your expectations. There are so many important details that the film misses, it seems as if it’s an entirely different story.
However, it turns out; even some authors don’t appreciate it when their books get turned into horrible movies. Here are some you might know:
Dirk Pitt’s movies were almost bad luck, especially for the author Clive Cussler. Clive Cussler’s tales included Dirk Pitt involved in a cult, and the movies didn’t have that. 2005’s Sahara, starring Penélope Cruz and Matthew McConaughey, was the biggest of all the failures.
The movie failed terribly at the box office, making a revenue of just $68 million to cover a cost of $145 million on production. When the author sued the producers for lack of control over the script as they previously agreed on, the author lost the case and had to pay $13.9 million of legal fees for the production company.
I guess the writer won’t be walking down that road again.
The author had very straightforward views on the movie Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. He thought that the film was “crummy” and that the director had “no talent or flair.” He also didn’t fancy Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka and thought he was “pretentious” and “bouncy”, which is why you didn’t get to see the sequel Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator.
J. D Salinger was very proud of his story Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, so he allowed the producers to make a movie out of it. They renamed it to “My Foolish Heart.”
However, he was very frustrated that his book was transformed into a cheesy love story. So he didn’t let anyone ruinCatcher in the Rye or Franny and Zooey.
The Shiningwas favourited by a lot of people, excluding the author. Stephen King was very outspoken in his criticisms.“I’d admired Kubrick for a long time and had great expectations for the project, but I was deeply disappointed in the end result. Kubrick just couldn’t grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel. So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn’t believe, he couldn’t make the film believable to others.”
He also used the words“a big, beautiful Cadillac with no engine inside it” for the movie.
Winston Groom was very frustrated over the fact that the producers left out some major lots of the story, so he let out his anger using the sequel. He started with the sentences, “Don’t never let nobody make a movie of your life’s story,” and “Whether they get it right or wrong, it don’t matter.”
He was also very insulted by the fact none of the cast and crew members mentioned his name in the six Academy Award acceptance speeches. He didn’t receive the 3% net profit as the producers claimed that they hadn’t made any gains as the expenses covered all of the profit.",1
"Billionaire tycoon George Soros has promised to donate $500 million to help migrants and refugees flood Europe.
Soros published an op-ed on Tuesday saying that his nonprofit organisation will help fund “work opportunities for migrants and refugees” coming into Europe.
On Monday it hosted its firstforum for Heads of State to discusshow to handle what’s been dubbed the world’s biggest refugee and migrant crisis since World War II. According to the U. N., 65.3 million people have been displaced from their homes by conflict and persecution in 2015. Since the crisis escalated last year, Europe has been struggling with how to handle the inflow of migrants.
“I will invest in startups, established companies, social-impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves,” Soros wrote. “Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world.”
Soros, 86, is a refugee himself. He fled Hungary in 1946 and spent his teenage years as a migrant in London. He worked as a railway porter and waiter to put himself through the London School of Economicsandlater moved to New York where he got his start working on Wall Street. In 1969 he established his own hedge fund, the Quantum Fund, with $12 million. Today Forbes estimates Soros’ net worth at $24.9 billion.
Through his Open Society foundations, Soros has said he plans to give away more than $11 billion in his lifetime. According to Soros, the latest$500 millioninvestment earmarked toward refugees andmigrants will be owned by his nonprofit foundation, and will be investments rather than grants. “They are intended to be successful—because I want to show how private capital can play a constructive role helping migrants—and any profits will go to fund programs at the Open Society Foundations, including programs that benefit migrants and refugees,” Soros wrote.
Over the past several years Soros has made several gifts toward organizations aimed at supporting immigrants, including the Migration Policy Institute, which analyzes the movement of people worldwide, and the National Immigration Law Center, dedicated to advancing the rights of low-income immigrants. Soros has also been an outspoken critic of Republican Presidential Nominee Donald Trump and his anti-immigration rhetoric, saying in January that “Donald Trump is doing the work of ISIS.” In March, he pledged $5 million through a super PAC called Immigrant Voters Win PAC, aiming to mobilize the vote of Hispanic and Latino voters against Trump.",1

United Medical Center in Southeast D. C. announced Friday that it would not need to rely on tax subsidies as it ends its fiscal year. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)    Southeast Washington’s troubled public hospital will end its fiscal year without need of a taxpayer subsidy but it is facing new financial problems after regulators’ shutdown of its nursery and delivery rooms, according to information presented Friday to the hospital’s board of directors. The presentation by Lilian Chukwuma, the hospital’s chief financial officer, projected that the number of inpatient stays at United Medical Center would drop by more than 7 percent during the next fiscal year, with outpatient visits declining more than 5 percent.  The shrinking patient base, which Chukwuma attributed to the closing of the obstetrics ward and publicity around its medical lapses, will intensify pressure on hospital managers to somehow make up for the lost money. The board meeting also raised questions about the future of the obstetrics ward, which District regulators closed on Aug. 7, citing dangerous medical errors that included failures to properly treat a woman with potentially fatal blood-pressure problems and to take basic steps to prevent a newborn from contracting HIV. The hospital’s budget for the upcoming fiscal year, which the board approved unanimously Friday, does not include any money for operating the obstetrics ward. Hospital officials say they have not decided when or even whether it will reopen, raising the possibility that two wards of the city — 7 and 8 — could be left permanently without a place for women to give birth. Purchased by the city in 2010, UMC remains the only full-service hospital east of the Anacostia River. Since last year it has been run by Veritas of Washington, a consulting firm led by campaign donors to D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). The District is paying Veritas a fee of $300,000 per month to stabilize the hospital’s finances. Budget figures released Friday show that the hospital, which has an annual budget of roughly $124 million, will narrowly end the fiscal year in the black, with an operating surplus of $409,000. But it has had to dip into its reserve funds to make ends meet.  D.C. Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S. DeWitt said UMC has about $6.4 million in cash on hand, compared to $9.3 million 30 days ago, an abrupt decline triggered in large part by a loss of federal Medicaid dollars that followed the obstetrics ward closure. DeWitt said in an interview that the cash reserve, should it dip any lower, will enter a dangerous zone where sudden large expenses — such as an unexpected legal settlement or unexpected overtime or severance pay — could jeopardize its ability to make payroll. “It is now at the level where we’re monitoring it frequently,” DeWitt said. “I don’t like it to get any lower than it is right now.” The 2018 budget is balanced but relies on ambitious plans to boost the hospital’s revenue by $9 million through billing improvements, as well as cutting expenses in other areas. During the current fiscal year, the consultants running the hospital delivered only a fraction of the millions in new revenue they promised to create. Hospital chief executive and Veritas employee Luis Hernandez said UMC has already started to improve its billing process and that he was confident the projected savings for the next fiscal year would be realized. “Some of those revenues we have been working on for a while, so it’s not just that everything’s starting,” Hernandez said. “But we’re going to get more efficient in that area, and in particular in making sure that we collect everything that we provide for.”",0
"Hundreds of journalists have begun publishing articles based on a massive document leak from companies that administer offshore accounts.
The files, dubbed the Paradise Papers, reveal a vast financial network—beyond the reach of most governments—maintained by the world’s wealthiest people. They include commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, Queen Elizabeth of the UK, and a close advisor to Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. More big names are expected later this week.
Here is our guide to the major revelations thus far.
What are the Paradise Papers?
The 13.4 million documents come from Appleby, a law firm based in Bermuda that specializes in offshore accounts, and its spin-off company Estera. They were leaked to the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, which shared the files with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and news organizations around the world. The source of the Paradise Papers has not been revealed.
Appleby, the law firm at the center of the documents, bills itself as “one of the world’s largest providers of offshore legal services.” Offshore accounts aren’t usually illegal unto themselves, but they can be used to hide money from governments that would levy taxes on them.
Sueddeutsche Zeitung and ICIJ won a Pulitzer prize this year for their work on the Panama Papers, another stash of offshore files.
Kremlin connections to investments in Facebook and Twitter
Companies controlled by the Russian government quietly invested in several major Silicon Valley startups, including Facebook and Twitter,the Paradise Papers reveal.
The investments were funnelled through DST Global, the venture capital firm owned by Russian billionaire Yuri Milner. VTB Bank, which is owned by Russia, put $191 million toward Milner’s 5% stake in Twitter in 2013. Gazprom, also controlled by the Kremlin, partnered with an offshore company to finance his 8% stake in Facebook in 2012. Milner has since sold those holdings.
Milner told the New York Times the investments by Russian state-owned companies were purely “a commercial arrangement” and had no political connections. “It was a different time,” he told ICIJ. “It never even occurred to me back then that VTB Bank was not just another investor for us.” But the deals are likely to be seen in a different light after the Russian government used accounts on Facebook and Twitter to influence the 2016 US presidential election.
US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross maintains a stake in a shipping company that is closely linked to the family of Russian president Vladimir Putin.
According to the Paradise Papers, Ross owns between $2 million and $10 million in shipping company Navigator. The second-biggest client of Navigator is Russian gas company Sibur. Kirill Shamalov, who is Putin’s son-in-law, has been deputy chairman of Sibur’s board and until April owned more than a fifth of the company. (He has since reduced his ownership share.)
Gennady Timchenko, a close friend of Putin, is also a part-owner of Sibur. Timchenko has been banned from entering the US since 2014. Sibur’s main shareholder is Leonid Mikhelson, reportedly Russia’s richest man and CEO of gas company Novatek, which has twice been sanctioned by the US government.
Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal accused Ross of misleading Congress in his confirmation hearing, telling NBC that senators had got the impression he had divested all shares from Navigator and were also unaware of the company’s links with Russia.
Ross’s spokesperson told NBC that he recuses himself from issues related to transoceanic shipping and that he “has been generally supportive of the administration’s sanctions of Russian business entities.” He reportedly did not respond to the accusation of misleading Congress.
Queen Elizabeth II has investments in several offshore funds that are widely considered to be tax havens. Her estate made the disclosure after some of the offshore funds, in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, turned up in the Paradise Papers.
The queen’s estate, known as the Duchy of Lancaster, said the investments were legal and did not provide her with any tax advantages. The Cayman Islands and Bermuda funds amount to 10 million ($13 million) of the estate’s 519 million ($679 million) in total assets. The duchy also disclosed that it “invests in a fund domiciled in Ireland,” but didn’t provide any details.
Through these offshore funds, the queen’s money was invested in some controversial companies, including BrightHouse, which leases home appliances and furniture to people who can’t afford to buy them outright. BrightHouse has been censured for exploiting its customers. The duchy said it wasn’t aware of the investment in BrightHouse or other companies.
Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has made a point of bashing “people not paying their fair share of taxes.” In March, he promised to do a “better job of getting tax avoiders and tax frauders.”
Somewhat awkwardly, the Paradise Papers show that Stephen Bronfman, one of the men Trudeau owes his political career to, has stashed millions of dollars in the Cayman Islands. That may have helped him legally avoid taxes in Canada, the US, and Israel, the Guardian writes.
Bronfman is a childhood friend, close advisor, and chief fundraiser for Trudeau. He is an heir to the Seagram distillery fortune.

"The massive operation appears to be an example of organized crime. The produce market was infested by a criminal operation that was well coordinated and which was hard to detect. Certainly vendors must have noticed what was going on though. Were they intimidated into keeping quiet?
The raid netted 22 people, all of whom were authorized to accept food stamps as payment for fresh produce at the south FloridaOpa-locka Hialeah Flea Market. The crimes could land the individual in prison for up to 20 years each.
The scam was very simple to pull off and shows just how reckless government is with taxpayer money. Instead of using actual food stamps, the government now issues a debit card with funds attached. The holders of the cards would simply swipe the cards without buying any produce. The vendor would then give the person cash while taking a cut himself. Since there is zero inventory control, it’s impossible to detect this cheating by just looking at electronic record. It’s a system that just invites cheating.
Karla Rodriguez Diaz, 28, owns Opa Locka Fruit and Produce Market, LLC, at the Opa-locka Hialeah Flea Market, 12705 NW 42nd Ave. Diaz and Luis Marzo Machado, 30, redeemed over $2.4 million in food stamps between August 2014 and March 2016.
Pedro Sanchez Barrero, 26, owns Pedro Produce in the flea market. Barrero, along with Antonia Barrero, 48, racked up about $2 million.
Diocenila Castro, 49, of Miami, owns Castro Produce in the flea market. From November 2014 through March 2016, Castro redeemed over $1.5 million.
Matias Jose Ramirez, 37, of Miami and Jorge Saladrigas Milian, 56, of Opa-locka, own Ramirez Produce and Jorge Produce in the flea market. From April 2014 through March 2016, they redeemed about $1.5 million.
Here’s the raid as it went down
Here’s the thing. We all know that there has to be a safety net to help people who are truly needy and who are not able to work. But this program has zero chance of working as administered by a bunch of bureaucrats in Washington who just don’t care.
Let’s kick people off this program if they are able bodied and have work available. Let’s send the money for this program to some private operation that will ensure , face to face with the customer, that only legitimate food is being purchased – Eggs, meat, pasta, rice, fruits and vegetables and milk.
Anything less is harming taxpayers AND the person who is supposed to be getting nutritious food for their family. We all know what’s really happening is that money is going to drug, alcohol, cigarettes, and IPhones.",1

Legendary Stage and Silver Screen Star Refused to Be Stereotyped, Overcame Racism and Blacklisting",0
"An internal investigation of the Transportation Security Administration revealed security failures at dozens of the nation’s busiest airports, where undercover investigators were able to smuggle mock explosives or banned weapons through checkpoints in 95 percent of trials, ABC News has learned.
The series of tests were conducted by Homeland Security Red Teams who pose as passengers, setting out to beat the system.
According to officials briefed on the results of a recent Homeland Security Inspector General’s report, TSA agents failed 67 out of 70 tests, with Red Team members repeatedly able to get potential weapons through checkpoints.
In one test an undercover agent was stopped after setting off an alarm at a magnetometer, but TSA screeners failed to detect a fake explosive device that was taped to his back during a follow-on pat down.
Officials would not divulge the exact time period of the testing other than to say it concluded recently.
Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was apparently so frustrated by the findings he sought a detailed briefing on them last week at TSA headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, according to sources. U. S. officials insisted changes have already been made at airports to address vulnerabilities identified by the latest tests.
“Upon learning the initial findings of the Office of Inspector General's report, Secretary Johnson immediately directed TSA to implement a series of actions, several of which are now in place, to address the issues raised in the report,” the DHS said in a written statement to ABC News.
Homeland security officials insist that security at the nation’s airports is strong – that there are layers of security including bomb sniffing dogs and other technologies seen and unseen. But the officials that ABC News spoke to admit these were disappointing results.
This is not the first time the TSA has had trouble spotting Red Team agents. A similar episode played out in 2013, when an undercover investigator with a fake bomb hidden on his body passed through a metal detector, went through a pat-down at New Jersey's Newark Liberty Airport, and was never caught.
At the time, the TSA said Red Team tests occurred weekly all over the United States and were meant to “push the boundaries of our people, processes, and technology.”
“We know that the adversary innovates and we have to push ourselves to capacity in order to remain one step ahead,” a TSA official wrote on the agency’s blog in March 2013. “[O]ur testers often make these covert tests as difficult as possible.”
In a 2013 hearing on Capitol Hill, then-TSA administrator John Pistole, described the Red Team as “super terrorists,” who know precisely which weaknesses to exploit.
“[Testers] know exactly what our protocols are. They can create and devise and conceal items that … not even the best terrorists would be able to do,” Pistole told lawmakers at a House hearing.
More recently, the DHS inspector general’s office concluded a series of undercover tests targeting checked baggage screening at airports across the country.
That review found “vulnerabilities” throughout the system, attributing them to human error and technological failures, according to a three-paragraph summary of the review released in September.
In addition, the review determined that despite spending $540 million for checked baggage screening equipment and another $11 million for training since a previous review in 2009, the TSA failed to make any noticeable improvements in that time.",0
"The Trump administration made history Tuesday inproposing that nearly 77 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico be made available for companies wanting to purchase federal oil and gas leases — the largest offering ever in the United States.
In announcing the sale, the Interior Department compared the targeted waters to “about the size of New Mexico” and said the first lease sales off Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are scheduled for March next year. The event will include “all available un-leased areas on the Gulf’s Outer Continental Shelf,” a statement said.
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke first broached such a sale shortly after he took office in March, proposing to offer 73 million acres for leases. This part of the Gulf was the scene of arguably the worst environmental disaster in U. S. history, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent spill of 215 million gallons of crudethat fouled beaches from Louisiana to Florida.
Years later, the spill’s effects are still being felt, according to a report by the nonprofit group Oceana.
Scientists have detected hydrocarbons from the well in 90 percent of pelican eggs more than 1,000 miles away in Minnesota, where the birds spend summer after wintering along the gulf.Dolphins living in Barataria, La., have experienced mortality rates 8 percent higher than dolphin populations elsewhere, and their reproduction success dropped 63 percent.
British Petroleum, which owned the operation, had paid penalties in excess of $61 billion as of July 2016.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Interior Department division that oversees offshore leases, offered assurances that the environment would be protected as additional leases are sold in the gulf. But the agency largely focused on the resources that could be recovered there as part of what President Trump calls America’s energy dominance.
“American energy production can be competitive while remaining safe and environmentally sound,” said Vincent DeVito, Interior’s counselor for energy policy.“People need jobs, the Gulf Coast states need revenue, and Americans do not want to be dependent on foreign oil.”
The bureau estimated that up to a billion barrels of oil and up to 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas could be recovered. Most of the sale will take place in the Gulf’s Central Planning Area off Louisiana and Mississippi.
“This is great news that our oil and gas industry in Louisiana sorely needs,” said Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), one of 12 lawmakers and governors whose support was quoted in the announcement. “This is the largest sale in U. S. history, and it will create jobs and bolster our state and national economy.Our Louisiana workers are ready to go back to work.”
Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) alsodeclared his approval.“Mississippi welcomes Secretary Zinke’s action to carry out the president’s vision for American energy dominance,” Bryant said.“This will strengthen our state’s status as a leader in oil and gas exploration and create good jobs for hard-working Mississippians.”
Few conservation groups reacted to Interior’s announcement Tuesday, although several had called theunprecedented lease sale “a terrible idea” whenZinke first discussed itthis spring. Athan Manuel, director of the Sierra Club’s Lands Protection Program, said it similarly opposed a bid by Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, to open up 66 million acres to leases last year.
Manuel hinted at the reasons behind the muted response Tuesday. It’s “not really news,” he said of the actual announcement. While larger in scale, it is not significantly different from what Obama proposed. The gulf, Manuel said, has become “a sacrifice zone for the oil and gas industry.”

Mayweather vs McGregor fight puts pirated livestreams in the spotlight
Saturday’s hotly-anticipated boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and UFC Champion Conor McGregor is sparking a fierce battle outside the ring over pirated livestreams.
Saturday’s fight at the T-Mobile arena in Las Vegas is being distributed live by Showtime Pay-Per-View, with pricing ranging from $90 to $100. Millions are expected to watch the intriguing battle between Mayweather and Irish MMA superstar McGregor.
The fight, however, has been described as potentially “the most pirated event in history” and has already prompted legal action by Showtime Networks. Earlier this month, the CBS subsidiary sued more than 40 websites to prevent unauthorized streaming of the clash.
WORLD WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENT GETS TOEHOLD IN CHINA WITH STREAMING DEAL
Despite the move, Eric Feinberg, a founding partner of deep web analysis company GIPEC, told Fox News that pirated streams are still being promoted via social media. “It’s a problem because it makes it look like it’s legitimate,” he said.
The fight also presents a potential challenge for Facebook if footage of the bout is streamed via Facebook Live. This could be shot at the event itself, or via TV footage.
Facebook told Fox News that it devotes ""significant resources"" to addressing copyrightissues for live content on the platform. ""Video publishers and media companies canprovide reference streams of live content that are checked against files in ourRights Manager tool,"" explained a Facebook spokesperson, in a statement emailed to Fox News. ""If a match surfaces, Rights Manager immediately takesaction on the rule set by the rights holder – for example, to block thatstream.""
ROBERT KRAFT SAYS FOOTBALL’S FUTURE IS VIA LIVESTREAMING
The spokesperson added that rights holders can also report live videos at any time during a live broadcast. ""We've been growing our global team that processes these reports across time zones and continue to invest in our copyright tools,"" he said. ""This remains a work in progress and we continue to listen to feedback from our partners to help improve our offerings.”
There is huge global interest in the super welterweight fight that marks 40-year-old Mayweather’s return to the ring. The 12-time world champion, who is regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, retired undefeated in 2015 with a record of 49-0.
The 29-year-old McGregor is the first fighter to hold two UFC titles simultaneously.
THE PENTAGON DOESN’T WANT ITS EMPLOYEES WATCHING MARCH MADNESS
“The fan and media interest exceeds what we have seen for the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight in 2015,” an event spokesperson told Fox News.
Two years ago Mayweather’s welterweight world championship unification fight with Manny Pacquiao, which was distributed by HBO and Showtime, set a new record of 4.6 million pay-per-view buys. However, Saturday’s clash is tipped to surpass this number.
In 2015, streaming app Periscope was forced to take down pirated streams of the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, as were other streaming apps.
Fox Business reports that pay-per-view purchases for Mayweather vs. McGregor could be in the neighborhood of 5 million buys.
Earlier this month, Mayweather told Fox Business that he expects to earn $300 million from the fight, with McGregor’s earnings expected to top $100 million.
For the first time, Showtime is making the event available to consumers on ShowtimePPV.com and through the Showtime PPV app on Apple mobile and Apple TV devices.

"An estimated 143 million U. S. consumers could be affected by a cybersecurity attack carried out by suspected criminal hackers, national credit-reporting company Equifax said Thursday.
The unauthorized access to information for nearly 44% of the U. S. population occurred from mid-May through July 2017 and primarily involved names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some cases, driver's license numbers, the company said in a detailed announcementof the attack.
Additionally, the hackers gained access to credit card numbers for roughly 209,000 consumers, plus certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 consumers.
Equifax also identified unauthorized access to limited personal information for certain United Kingdom, and Canadian residents.
However, there was no evidence of unauthorized activity on Equifax's core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases, the company said.
""This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do,"" Equifax Chairman and CEO Richard Smith said in a statement issued with the announcement. ""I apologize toconsumers and our business customers for the concern and frustration this causes.""
The company also posted questions and answers about the incident for investors.
The news sent shares of Equifax (EFX) down nearly 9% to $130.05in after-hours Thursday trading.
Financial regulatory filings show that three of the company's top executives sold shares of Equifax stock after July 29, the date the firm said the cyber breach was detected.
On Aug. 1, Chief Financial Officer John Gamble sold shares with a market value of nearly $946,400, while Joseph Loughran, president of Equifax's U. S. Information Solutions, exercised options to sell nearly $584,100. Rodolfo Ploder, president of business unit Workforce Solutions, sold shares valued at nearly $250,500 on Aug. 2, the filings show. The three executives continued to hold tens of thousands of Equifax shares after the transactions.
Equifax said the officials ""had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred"" at the time they sold their shares.
News of the cyberattackcomes less than three months after the global Petya ransomware attack spread through computers across North America and Europe, affecting 65 countries. Similarly, themassive attack of the 'WannaCry' ransomware virus infected computers around the world in May.
Computer systems for the IRS, Target, and other government agencies and private companies have also been struck by cyberattacks in recent years. And Yahoo last year disclosed that information from an estimated 500 million of the internet giant's accounts was stolen in 2014.
Atlanta-based Equifax is one of the nation's largest credit-reporting companies, along with Experian and TransUnion. Equifax says it organizes and analyzes data on more than 820 million consumers and more than 91 million businesses worldwide, and the company's databases hold employee data submitted by more than 7,100 employers.
After discovering the electronic intrusion, Equifaxsaid it hired an independent cybersecurity firm that has since been conducting a forensic investigation aimed at determining the scope of the electronic intrusion and the specific data accessed.
Equifax also reported the attack to law enforcement agencies and is continuing to work with them, the company said.
Additionally, the company established a dedicated website, www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, to help consumers determine whether their personal information may have been accessed and sign up for credit file monitoring and identity theft protection.
The program, offered without charge to U. S. consumers for one year, includes monitoring of Equifax, Experian and TransUnion credit reports, copies of Equifax credit reports, identity theft insurance, internet scanning for Social Security numbers and the ability to lock and unlock Equifax credit reports.
Separately, Equifax said the company would send direct mail notices to consumers whose credit card numbers or dispute documents were affected by the cyber breach. The company also is contacting U. S. state and federal regulators and has sent written notifications to all U.S. state attorneys general about the incident.",0
"(Before It's News)According to the National Onion Association (yes, that’s a thing), approximately 170 countries grow onions, and it’s estimated that 9.2 million acres of onions are harvested annually around the world. Onions are low in calories and packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. They also go great in your salads, omelets and guacamole recipes.
However, as everyone from expert chefs to culinary novices has learned, onions can bring a tear to your eye, and an expert from the Texas A&M College of Medicine explains why that happens.
Credit: Pixabay
Sulfur in the dirt mixes with the growing onion and creates amino acid sulfoxides, which are sulfur compounds that readily turn into a gas. When an onion breaks apart, the sulfoxides and onion enzymes are released, and this creates sulfenic acid. The sulfenic acid and onion enzymes react and create syn-propanethial-S-oxide—a tough-to-pronounce gas.
This gas floats up from the chopped (or bitten) onion and deters critters (and causes humans to shed tears). It takes a lot of precise chemical reactions, and some vegetables related to onions will produce fewer tears. White, yellow and red onions all have higher concentration of the onion enzyme necessary to create syn-propanethial-S-oxide while sweet onions, green onions and scallions have fewer of the necessary enzymes.
“It really is a complicated chemical process that creates the gas,” said Robert H. Rosa Jr., MD, ophthalmologist and professor of surgery and medical physiology at the Texas A&M College of Medicine. “They all act as precursors that create the lachrymatory process—or what makes you tear up.”
Onions and your eyes
Your eyes are sensitive, and considering their responsibilities, it’s good that they have defenses to harmful gases.
“Your eyes have a set of nerves that detect anything that’s potentially harmful to your eyes,” Rosa said. “Your eyes react to the gas that is formed, and your eyes try to flush it out with tears.”
Luckily, the gases that are produced from chopping onions are more nuisance than harm. “Chopping onions can cause some burning and irritation and tears,” Rosa said. “Other than that, it’s pretty safe on your eyes. It’s a temporary sensation with no known long-term effects, nor will it worsen any other conditions, like pink eye.”
Also, some people may have more sensitive eyes than others, which is why not everyone will tear up when they chop onions but why others may feel the effects on the other side of the room.
Avoiding the tears
There are a few different ways to avoid tears when you’re cutting onions. You can prevent the gas from reaching your eyes by wearing protective goggles, but that may be a bit excessive considering you’re in a kitchen and not a laboratory.
“Some people may cut the onions in a bowl of water,” Rosa said. “I’d personally recommend using eye drops, like comfort drops, to help lubricate or rinse the eyes and dilute the gas exposure to the eyes.”
There has been talk about genetically modifying onions to knock out the alliinase enzyme that causes tears, without changing the particular spice that onions provide in flavor. However, tear-free onions have yet to be commercialized. So, if you’re planning to add some onions to your favorite recipes, you may want a couple of tissues handy.",1

"There has been another mass shooting in the United States - at least 26 people were killed in an attack on a Texas church. The attack comes just one month after the worst mass shooting in the US, and has again raised questions about gun ownership and whether there should be tougher controls.
About 40% of Americans say they own a gun or live in a household with one, according to a 2017 survey, and the rate of murder or manslaughter by firearm is the highest in the developed world. There were more than 11,000 deaths as a result of murder or manslaughter involving a firearm in 2016.
Homicides are taken here to include murder and manslaughter. The FBI separates statistics for what it calls justifiable homicide, which includes the killing of a criminal by a police officer or private citizen in certain circumstances, which are not included.
While it is difficult to know exactly how many guns civilians own around the world, by every estimate the US with around 270 million is far out in front.
Switzerland and Finland are the European countries with the most guns per person - they both have compulsory military service for all men over the age of 18.  Cyprus, Austria and Yemen also have military service.
There have been more than 90 mass shootings in the US since 1982, according to investigative magazine Mother Jones.
Up until 2012, a mass shooting was defined as when an attacker had killed four or more victims in an indiscriminate rampage - and since 2013 the figures include attacks with three or more victims. The shootings do not include killings related to other crimes such as armed robbery or gang violence.
The overall number of people killed in mass shootings each year represents only a tiny percentage of the total number.
There were nearly twice as many suicides involving firearms in 2015 as there were murders involving guns, and the rate has been increasing in recent years. Suicide by firearm accounts for almost half of all suicides in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A 2016 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found there was a strong relationship between higher levels of gun ownership in a state and higher firearm suicide rates for both men and women.
The average age of attackers in 91 recorded US mass shootings is 34.
Paddock is one of three killers aged over 60. The others are: William D Baker, 66, who killed five people in Illinois in 2001; and Kurt Myers, 64, who killed five people in New York state in 2013.
The youngest killer is Andrew Douglas Golden, 11, who ambushed students and teachers as they left Westside Middle School in Arkansas, 1998. He was jointly responsible with Mitchell Scott Johnson, 13, for five deaths and 10 injured.
The Las Vegas attack was the worst in recent US history - and the three shootings with the highest number of casualties have all happened within the past 10 years.
Military-style assault weapons have been blamed for some of the major mass shootings such as the attack in an Orlando nightclub and at the Sandy Hook School in Connecticut. The police said dozens of rifles had been recovered from the scene of the Las Vegas shooting.
A few US states have banned assault weapons, which were totally restricted for a decade until 2004. However most murders caused by guns involve handguns, according to FBI data.
For those from countries where guns are not widely owned, it can be a surprise to discover that they are relatively cheap to purchase in the US.
Handguns, which were reportedly among Paddock's arsenal discovered in his hotel room, can cost from as little $200 (151) - as much as a Chromebook laptop for example - and can be bought from gun shops.
Assault rifles like the ones also reportedly found in Paddock's room can cost from around $1500 (1,132).
Given that 23 weapons were found at the hotel and further 19 at his home, Paddock may have spent more than $70,000 (52,800) on weapons and accessories, such as tripods, scopes, ammunition and cartridges.
US public opinion on the banning of handguns has changed dramatically over the last 60 years. This dataset is incomplete but it shows that support has shifted over time and now a significant majority opposes a ban on handguns, according to polling by Gallup.
Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restricting the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill, or on ""watch"" lists.
But Republicans and Democrats are much more divided over other policy proposals, such as whether to allow ordinary citizens increased rights to carry concealed weapons - according to a survey from Pew Research Center.
In his latest comment on the shootings, President Donald Trump said he would be ""talking about gun laws as times goes by"". The White House said now is not the time to be debating gun control.
His predecessor, Barack Obama, struggled to get any new gun control laws onto the statute books, because of Republican opposition.
The National Rifle Association (NRA) campaigns against all forms of gun control in the US and argues that more guns make the country safer.
It is among the most powerful special interest lobby groups in the US, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy.
In total about one in five US gun owners say they are members of the NRA - and it has especially widespread support from Republican-leaning gun owners, according to Pew Research.
In terms of lobbying, the NRA officially spends about $3m per year to influence gun policy.
The chart shows only the recorded contributions to lawmakers published by the Senate Office of Public Records. The NRA spends millions more elsewhere, such as on supporting the election campaigns of political candidates who oppose gun controls.",0

MOON CYCLE BAKERY WAS FOUNDED WITH A SIMPLE MISSION: TO HELP WOMEN REDEFINE THEIR “TIME OF THE MONTH.”
We’re a baked goods delivery service encouraging individuals to celebrate the magic that lives within their cycle.We know this time of the month can be challenging, but we also know this time offers enhanced creativity, a stronger connection to our intuition, and an opportunity to shed layers – both literally and figuratively.And that calls for a celebration.
Once a month, we deliver delicious treats that that not only taste good – but hug your body with carefully selected, hormone-supportive ingredients designed to nourish you from the inside out.We’ve created our own period tracking app so that we have deeper insight into your cycle.Irregular?order our one-time package!Every 28 days?Pre-order with us so that we can show up on your doorstep before your expected date.
At Moon Cycle Bakery, we believe the days of resenting our cycle are over.We want your Moon Cycle treat to serve as a quiet reminder for you to celebrate the art of being a woman, rather than wish it away.Because at the end of the day, you deserve to rest, replenish, and recognize the moon dust that lives inside of your bones.
As they explain on their website, the name of their bakery has evolved from the word “Menustration” which comes from the Greek word “Menus” meaning both moon and power, and “Men” meaning month.
They alsotold us a little about the ingredients they use.
Their chocolate cups sweetened with ginger and honey contains magnesium, which is a key nutrient we lose while we menstruate. They also offer gluten free raspberry black bean brownie with primrose full of vitamin c, iron, calcium, magnesium and omega-6, all of which we lose during our period and which helps us maintain that balance we need.
I found the matcha coconut bites the most thoughtful goody as it contains fibre and omega-3 which help us with the sickening cramps and other PMS symptoms.
At Moon Cycle, we don't take what we put into our bodies lightly; in fact we're big believers that we can feel more alive, have more patience with ourselves and the world around us and boogie a bit harder if we're conscious about what we put into our bodies. Because of this, we’re always on the hunt for the freshest ingredients and highest quality brand names. You can rest assured that every treat you receive has been baked with wholesome, high quality ingredients (and a little moon dust for good measure.) : @_foodstories_

"In recent years, baseball seemed on the outs. Football was the challenger turned champion, the new national pastime. Baseball was too slow, had too many games. Football was only once a week, ha ha ha.
Little did they know how we'd soon be footballed out. As the greed grew, they even tried to stuff Thursday Night Football down our throats like pie after turkey with cranberry sauce -- come on, have some more! There's plenty! Including a bold attempt to make us watch (or find) something called The NFL Network to see some of those midweek yawners.
I am tired of watching young, physically fit men being carried off football fields, limbs broken into pieces, skulls rung like bells. I am tired of reading about older men, former players, experiencing dementia, donating their brains to science so that future generations of football players can judge for themselves whether they care to place their lives at risk to score or block six points.
Aren't you sick of this carnage? I sure am.
I also am tired of a football stadium being a forum for social protest and political posturing, creating rifts between playing performers and paying customers, dividing fans who can't distinguish a complaint over racial injustice from a stand against patriotism. The fans on both sides, either for or against athletes who could choose to protest in some different fashion, are being egged on by those with more power, including world leaders who spin the circumstances in their own politically convenient direction.
Aren't you sick of the arguments? I sure am.
Just as I am tired of NFL owners shooting off their big mouths, particularly shooting them off in Texas, like the Houston Texans' sanctimonious owner Bob McNair comparing players' behavior to ""inmates running the prison,"" or the Dallas Cowboys' ornery owner Jerry Jones kneeling with players one week, then threatening to bench them if they do it again the next week. I am as sick of that attitude as I am of that topic.
I am sick of it during Monday Night Football, during Thursday Night Football, during college football on Saturday morning, noon and night, during Sunday morning NFL games played in England and afternoon doubleheaders, game after game after game.
It always makes me laugh to hear Carrie Underwood sing how she's ""been waiting all day for Sunday night.""
Maybe you have, lady, but a bunch of the rest of us sure haven't. We can't wait all day for football when all we've been doing all week is watching football.
Television ratings for football are falling. Meanwhile, Game 5 of the World Series -- whose 5.5 hour slugfest lit Twitter on fire and was widely described as ""epic"" -- gave a good thumping to Sunday night's NFL contest. Monday night's game between Kansas City and Denver was reportedly down 9% from the previous week's game -- and there was NO baseball game played that night.
At a function in New York recently, even CEO of 21st Century Fox James Murdoch astutely addressed ""the proliferation of football"" and how omnipresent this sport now seems to be. The chairman of NBC Sports, Mark Lazarus, also was quoted in an interview about how ""by the time you get to Sunday, there could be a fatigue.""
Fox and NBC are networks seriously into football, but overexposure of their product is not exactly good for business.
Baseball isn't always easy to find on the big networks, either, no matter how many games there are. (And there are a lot.) The once-popular ""game of the week"" is barely a flicker now on TV compared to the NFL. Certain teams -- the Dodgers, in particular -- have become entangled in cable disputes that keep many fans from seeing them play.
In terms of controversy, though, baseball currently has little compared to football. Baseball veterans with brain trauma? Not many. Baseball players taking a knee during national anthems? Hardly any (though, admittedly, the one Major Leaguer to do so has become a little notorious).

"Wall Street has just received a reminder that initial public offerings are not child’s play. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America presided over a 41 percent drop in shares of Funko, the maker of pop-culture dolls, for the worst first-day showing in 17 years. On the same day, Allena Pharmaceuticals, a company developing drugs for metabolic diseases, fell 29 percent. Faddish, highly leveraged and speculative firms can find a buyer — if bankers price them right first.
Trying to gauge investor demand for such companies can be difficult. The definition of what is considered risky tends to shrink as animal spirits rise, and vice versa. For example, there were no biotech I. P.O.s for a year and a half during the financial meltdown nearly a decade ago. Investors had no interest in companies without profit or revenue. That’s not the case this year, with over 30 biotech offerings so far.
Bankers are well paid to find the right price. Companies don’t want to mess up their public debut, so they tend to prefer the top Wall Street firms and can pay hefty fees.
Funko is not the sort of firm that investors would clamor to buy when markets were weak. Its private-equity owner had extracted more than $100 million in cash from the firm since it went private in 2015, leaving its debt at over $200 million. Funko also lost money in the first six months of the year. A robust holiday season could produce a profit, but it is also questionable whether selling giant-headed dolls of pop-culture figures is a sustainable business.
The fact that bankers cut the amount of shares offered and reduced the price from the indicated range, yet the stock still suffered a vertiginous drop, could simply indicate they got demand wrong. Then again, the poor performance that both Funko and Allena suffered could signal something bigger: investors’ receding appetite for risk.

"The human hand is remarkably different from that of other primates, with shorter fingers, a smaller palm and a significantly stronger thumb; of course, the most notable feature of our hands is the ability of the thumb to perfectly and comfortably oppose (come into square contact at the tips) each finger of the same hand. While we can’t know with 100% certainty all the factors that led to the evolution of our hands, it would seem it all revolves around this perfect possibility, and the various advantages that provides in certain scenarios, that has dictated the length of each finger.
It’s not entirely clear when the modern human hand appeared. Prior to a recent discovery, the consensus was about 800,000 years ago. However, after finding a third metacarpal with a styloid(lump at the base) dating back to 1.4 million years ago, scientists are now wondering if the modern hand evolved even earlier.
The hands of our ancestors millions of years ago were much like those of modern chimpanzees, whose hands, palms and fingers are much longer, and thumbs are much smaller and weaker. Evolved to accommodate knuckle walking and climbing through trees, their fingers are curved, and the tips lack the broad bones (apical tufts) to support the highly sensitive, wide fatty pads of human fingertips.
Altogether, this produces a hand that works very well for hooking onto horizontal supports (e.g., tree branches) but can easily lose its grip when waiving a stick and has little strength or precision when attempting to squeeze or pinch.
Compared to this poor-gripping, relatively awkward paw, our hands have much shorter palms and fingers. Our fingertips have strong supportive bones on top of which are broad, sensitive, fatty pads that will accommodate uneven surfaces. The palm also has added fatty pads, some of which provide further protection for the hand, and also aids in gripping.
The bases of the thumb, second and third fingers have all been strengthened to withstand greater stress, and in fact, the thumb has three muscles attached not seen in chimpanzees: the flexor pollicis longus, flexor pollicis brevis and first volar interosseous. Together, these make for a significantly stronger thumb that, along with some modifications to certain joints, allows for full, comfortable opposability.
Researchers have focused on several theories to explain why these changes occurred, and one of the most popular is that a better, stronger, finer grip was needed for making better tools and thus those who had such a grip had a distinct advantage in this way and others were selected out. Using stone tools dates back to about 3.4 million years ago, and around 1.7 million years ago, more refined (but still crude) tools, like axes and cleavers, had appeared. Over the next million or so years, tools became progressively more refined, while the hand evolved to its modern state; since hand strength and dexterity are required to make and use better tools, it is thought that the advantages the latter provide led to the evolution of the former.
Another similar theory holds that our hands evolved thanks to the advantages this provides in accurately throwing and clubbing things. In support of this hypothesis, scientists point to the fact that there are two main prehensile (gripping) actions of a human hand: one that grasps with precision and one that holds with power.
The precision grip is perhaps best illustrated as the way a pitcher holds a baseball, while the power grip can be seen in the way a man holds an axe. According to adherents of this theory, without the evolved, long and opposable thumb, and precise control of fingertips, a primate couldn’t throw with much strength or accuracy. Likewise, without the vice formed by the thumb overlapping the fingers, and its new powerful flexor pollicis longus muscle and the additional fat on the palms, an axe would easily slip from the hands of a primate (as is sometimes seen with chimpanzees wielding sticks).
A third, equally violent theory acknowledges both of the first as potentially contributing factors, but notes that neither explains precisely why the hand holds its present, relatively stocky shape. Claiming however, to have the key to the “geometry” of our hands, adherents of this theory note that the human hand only becomes a truly strong weapon when it is formed into a fist.
They also identify several facts in support: (1) chimpanzees cannot form a good fist; (2) the smaller surface area of a fist delivers a blow with greater force; and (3) the way the bones are arranged when one makes a fist imparts even more force on the victim.
And it is the precision with which the bones are aligned that the researchers feel most bolsters their argument. When clenched in a fist, there is no space inside, and this is because of the precise lengths of the finger bones; in addition, the excellent support provided by the thumb is due to the fact that it is precisely the right length, and begins at just the right place on the palm.",1

"Theresa May has promised to revive a plan to cap energy prices for an extra 12 million consumers, saving them an average of 100 a year.
The idea was promised in the Conservative's election manifesto, but there was no mention of it in June's Queen's Speech.
The full details will be published in a draft Parliamentary bill next week.
However, many in the industry were critical of her announcement. The CBI said it was ""not the best answer"".
The Labour Party said the plan did not go far enough and it was unclear ""when and how"" action would be taken or whether it would be left to the regulator Ofgem.
The cap is likely to apply to everyone who is currently on a standard variable tariff (SVT). Such rates have been criticised as being more expensive than fixed-term contracts.
Mrs May told the Tory party conference in Manchester that Britain's energy market was broken and needed to be fixed.
""The energy market punishes loyalty with higher prices, and the most loyal customers are often those with lower incomes, the elderly, people with lower qualifications and people who rent their homes,"" she said.
When the regulator, Ofgem, was asked to look into the idea of a price cap, it suggested expanding the scheme that already limits prices for four million consumers on pre-payment meters.
Ofgem wanted to extend that cap, but only to other customers deemed to be vulnerable.
The Conservatives want to go much further by bringing all 12 million people on SVTs into the scope of the cap.
The safeguard tariff, as it is known, would be set - and regularly reviewed -by Ofgem.
It would also be temporary.
Ofgem said its top priority was to protect consumers and it would co-operate with the government.
""We share the government's concern that the market is not working for all consumers, especially the vulnerable, and will work with the government on their plans announced today to better protect consumers on poor value deals,"" an Ofgem spokesperson said.
Government sources suggested the process could be speeded up with Ofgem's co-operation, as that might remove the requirement for legislation.
Going the Parliamentary route is likely to mean that any such cap is unlikely to be in force before next winter.
* It will affect 12 million consumers on SVTs
* On average, it should save those consumers 100 a year
* It will be set, and reviewed regularly, by Ofgem
* It will be temporary
* It may not come into effect until the winter of 2018-19
The CBI was highly critical of the government's move.
""Today's announcement is an example of state intervention that misses the mark,"" said Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI's director general.
""Market-wide price caps are not the best answer."" However, she welcomed the possibility of standard variable tariffs being phased out.
Others in the energy industry were also critical, saying that a price cap risked stifling competition.
""Over three million consumers have switched already this year and the number of standard tariffs have fallen by almost a million in the last six months,"" said Lawrence Slade, Energy UK chief executive.
""It is important that we do not risk halting this growth of competition and engagement in the market.""
""We support Theresa May's commitment to tackle the broken energy market and the exploitation by the Big Six, which disproportionately affects vulnerable customers,"" said Ed Kamm, First Utility's chief commercial officer.
""The majority of consumers pay far too much for energy and many have been doing so for decades. Time has finally been called on the Big Six's behaviour.""
Citizens Advice welcomed the news, but said that some vulnerable consumers might need help before the bill could be passed into law.
One energy supplier - E. On - has already said that it will phase out standard variable tariffs from next year.
Mrs May's announcement put the skids under energy company shares prices, with British Gas-owner Centrica closing down more than 6%. Rival SSE closed down more than 3.2%.",0
"The food chains recovered more rapidly than previously assumed after Earth’s most devastating mass extinction event about 252 million years ago as demonstrated by the fossilized skull of a large predatory fish called Birgeria americana discovered by paleontologists from the University of Zurich in the desert of Nevada.
Illustration:Possible look of the newly discovered predatory fish species Birgeria americana with the fossil oft he skull shown at bottom right

The most catastrophic mass extinction on Earth took place about 252 million years ago – at the boundary between the Permian and Triassic geological periods. Up to 90 percent of the marine species of that time were annihilated. Worldwide biodiversity then recovered in several phases throughout a period of about five million years. Until now, paleontologists have assumed that the first predators at the top of the food chain did not appear until the Middle Triassic epoch about 247 to 235 million years ago.
Unexpected find of a large predatory fish
Swiss and U. S. American researchers led by the Paleontological Institute and Museum of the University of Zurich have discovered the fossil remains of one of the earliest large-sized predatory fishes of the Triassic period: an approximately 1.8-meter-long primitive bony fish with long jaws and sharp teeth. This fish belongs to a previously unknown species called Birgeria americana. This predator occupied the sea that once covered present-day Nevada and the surrounding states already one million years after the mass extinction.

Birgeria hunted similarly to the extant great white shark: the prey fish were pursued and bitten, then swallowed whole. Species of Birgeria existed worldwide. The most recent discovery is the earliest example of a large-sized Birgeria species, about one and a half times longer than geologically older relatives.
Predators appeared earlier than assumed
According to earlier studies, marine food chains were shortened after the mass extinction event and recovered only slowly and stepwise. In addition, researchers assumed that the ancient equatorial regions were too hot for vertebrates to live during the Early Triassic. Finds such as the newly discovered Birgeria species and the fossils of other vertebrates now show that so-called apex predators (animals at the very top of the food chain) already lived early after the mass extinction. The existence of bony fish close to the equator  where Nevada was located during the Early Triassic  indicates that the temperature of the sea was a maximum of 36°C. The eggs of today’s bony fish can no longer develop normally at constant temperatures above 36°C.
“The vertebrates from Nevada show that previous interpretations of past biotic crises and associated global changes were too simplistic,” Carlo Romano says. Despite the severity of the extinctions of that time and intense climatic changes, the food webs were able to redevelop faster than previously assumed.",1
"LONDON — Britain's government has announced controversial plans that would force businesses to declare how many foreign workers they employ, amid concern over immigration.
U. K. minister Amber Rudd faced accusations of xenophobia and even racism Wednesday after revealing the plans at the annual conference of the country's ruling Conservative Party.
""The purpose of this review is whether [businesses are] doing enough to train people locally,"" Rudd told the BBC early Wednesday. Without giving a timetable for the consultation, Rudd said she wanted to ""flush out"" businesses that looked abroad rather than employing or training British workers.
The proposal is one of several measures designed to reduce annual net migration from more than 300,000 to the government's long-stated goal of ""tens of thousands."" Immigration was one of the main concerns of people who voted to leave the European Union during June's Brexit referendum.
Of the 31.7 million workforce at the end of June, 5.4 million were born outside the country, according to Reuters.
The plan has angered some business leaders, with Adam Marshall, acting director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, telling the BBC that he thought firms would be ""saddened if they felt that having a global workforce was somehow seen as a badge of shame.""
James O'Brien, a talk shot host on radio station LBC, likened the proposals to ""Mein Kamf,"" the 1925 book by Adolf Hitler in which he outlined his nationalist ideology. O'Brien read out what he said was a line from Rudd's conference speech before revealing it was in fact a passage by Hitler.
Rudd defended her plans Wednesday. ""We should be able to have a conversation about immigration,"" she told the BBC. ""If we do talk about immigration, don't call me a racist.""",0

But what exactly isSouthern Comfort?
If you answered whiskey, you’re not alone. But you’re also wrong.
Although it looks like whiskey and tastes a lot like whiskey-- and it’s usually stocked alongside the whiskeys at liquor stores-- Southern Comfort doesn't actually contain any whiskey in its current formulation.
But all that’s about to change in July, when the brand’s new owners at the Sazerac Company plan to debut an all-new version of “The Spirit of New Orleans,” reports The New York Times.
According to Kevin Richards, who has served as the senior marketing director of Southern Comfort since the brand was purchased away from Brown-Forman last year, SoCo was “in danger of losing a lot of relevance in the minds of consumers.”
Now, in an effort to bolster the brand’s reputation, the Sazerac Company will be fortifying the liqueur with honest-to-goodness whiskey, as opposed to the spirits it’s currently blended with. They’re also redesigning the brand’s bottles and labels, to further distance themselves from the former recipe.
Starting in July, Southern Comfort will roll out its new formula, starting with 70-, 80- and 100-proof versions. According to the Times, the company is also doing away with flavored SoCo variations like Lime Comfort and Caramel Comfort. Instead, they’re working on new products called Southern Comfort Rye and Southern Comfort Barrel Select — names that seem to hint at the brand’s newest ingredient.
“For us, whiskey is the root of the brand and we’re going to embrace that, and not play in that liqueur space,” said Richards.
That might seem like an odd thing to say — i.e., calling whiskey “the root of the brand” — but Richards isn’t entirely wrong. Southern Comfort did once contain whiskeywhen it was first bottled by bartender Martin Wilkes Heron in the late 19th Century. But over the years, the bourbon was replaced with neutral spirits, and the recipe remained that way.

Customers, however, should be mindful that SoCo’s new offerings are still technically blended liqueurs, albeit more whiskey-centric blended liqueurs. Either way, it’s a step in the right direction, according to Mark Brown, the chief executive of the Sazerac Company.
“If we’re right between Jack Daniel’s and Jim Beam on the shelf, that will be fine with us,” Brown said.",0

"When I trained to be a doctor, some four decades ago, everyone neglected sleep. “On call” duty for hospital interns began at 6 A. M. and lasted twenty-four hours; I often kept on working until early evening the next day, after which I would stumble back to my apartment and fall asleep in my clothes. The ethic was not to complain. You were being toughened up—“iron man” was the term we all used—to deal with the demands of doctoring, which did not respect the clock. But that wasn’t the only way in which sleep was disregarded. In medical school, the subject had been covered in only the most cursory way. In a class on the brain, an instructor mentioned a neural pathway, the reticular activating system, that was associated with wakefulness. In passing, he also told us about narcolepsy, a rare condition that could cause people to sink into slumber at any moment and that had other fascinating features, such as vivid hallucinations and abrupt loss of muscle control. That was it. Ordinary sleep, it seemed, was not a subject that medicine concerned itself with.Today, interns still work difficult hours, but the medical world’s opinions on sleep have changed. There’s a field of sleep science dedicated to the biology of repose. Sleep medicine has become a specialty, with fellowship training programs and clinics devoted to caring for those suffering from sleep disorders. And these disorders are not rare. Some forty-seven million adults, according to the National Sleep Foundation, do not get a restorative night’s sleep. In the workplace, sleep deprivation results in injuries and decreased productivity, which is thought to cost the U.S. eighteen billion dollars each year. As many as 1.2 million car crashes—twenty per cent of the annual total—can be attributed to tired drivers, so it could be said that lack of sleep causes thousands of deaths and injuries every year.These numbers have not escaped the notice of the business world, and there is now a thriving sleep industry. Pharmaceutical companies ply us with Ambien and Lunesta, and entrepreneurs have devised any number of outlandish gadgets to foster slumber. In January, merchants at the Consumer Electronics Show unveiled “smart pajamas,” containing a “bioceramics gel,” which purportedly cool off “the body’s infrared heat emissions” to foster longer, sounder sleep. There was also a respiration sensor that straps to one’s chest and features an app, which synchronizes breathing with tonal music to help lower anxiety. Gadgets that pipe relaxing “neuroacoustic sounds” into earbuds are marketed as triggering brain waves that erase the sense of time. “Smart pillows” are programmed to record the quality of the previous night’s rest and then offer tips on improvements through an app. And, if you have three thousand dollars to spare, there’s the Magnesphere, a pod, six feet in circumference, which envelops the body in allegedly restorative electromagnetic fields. Less expensive sleep aids include weighted blankets, which confer the sensation of being swaddled; customized goggles, which aim to set your circadian rhythm by shining light at various wavelengths; and mattresses that mold to your body.Sleep, according to the Sunday Style section of the Times, is a new status symbol, a sign of prosperity and control in a frenetic world. And, as if to confirm that sleep science is an important, even trendy field, this year’s Nobel Prize in Medicine went to three researchers who deciphered the genes responsible for regulating our circadian rhythms. Still, although we may know more about sleep than ever before, it remains one of the most enigmatic phenomena in our daily lives. “Why do all forms of life, from plants, insects, sea creatures, amphibians and birds to mammals, need rest or sleep?” Meir Kryger asks in his new book, “The Mystery of Sleep” (Yale). Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School, is a leader in the field of sleep medicine, and has treated more than thirty thousand patients with sleep problems during a career that spans four decades. He draws on this voluminous clinical experience in his book, which is an authoritative and accessible survey of what is known, what is believed, and what is still obscure about normal patterns of sleep and the conditions that disrupt it. As he readily admits, “No one has been able to declare with certainty why all life forms need sleep.”
In Chapter 4 of “The Pickwick Papers,” which appeared in serial format in April, 1836, Charles Dickens’s readers were introduced to “a fat and red-faced boy, in a state of somnolency,” named Joe. Joe works as an assistant to a carriage driver, and continually falls asleep in the middle of his tasks:“Very extraordinary boy, that,” said Mr. Pickwick; “does he always sleep in this way?”“Sleep!” said the old gentleman, “he’s always asleep. Goes on errands fast asleep, and snores as he waits at table.”“Ah! odd indeed,” returned the old gentleman; “I’m proud of that boy—wouldn’t part with him on any account—he’s a natural curiosity! Here, Joe—Joe—take these things away, and open another bottle—d’ye hear?”The fat boy rose, opened his eyes, swallowed the huge piece of pie he had been in the act of masticating when he last fell asleep, and slowly obeyed his master’s orders. Dickens’s hyperactive imagination produced hundreds of bizarre characters. In the nineteen-fifties, some researchers were reminded of Joe when they studied an obese amateur poker player who had fallen asleep in the middle of a game. They gave the man’s condition a name: Pickwickian syndrome. Subsequent study of what is now known as obesity hypoventilation syndrome has shown that Joe was a product not of Dickens’s imagination but of powers of observation so acute that the writer had accurately recorded a pathological condition more than a century before medical science took note of it. We now know that being very overweight can prevent people from breathing deeply enough and quickly enough to keep themselves supplied with oxygen. The resulting low oxygen levels and high carbon-dioxide levels explain not only why Joe is always falling asleep but also why he is red in the face.Meir Kryger, who tells the story of Joe in his book, has been working since the nineteen-seventies on a related condition, sleep apnea, in which a person’s airway closes during sleep, breathing stops, and, starved for air, the person awakens. Apnea can lead to heart attack and stroke from decreased oxygen, and may accelerate cognitive decline in older people. Kryger writes that there are descriptions of sleep apnea that predate Dickens’s Joe. Dionysius, a tyrant who ruled the Cretan kingdom of Heraclea in the fourth century B.C., was massively overweight. Because he repeatedly fell asleep, Dionysius hired people to poke him with long, thin needles, probably to keep him breathing. Sleep apnea was once thought to be rare, but, now that there are sophisticated diagnostic tools to measure respiration and muscle contractions, it is known to afflict some two to three per cent of the U.S. population—five million men and two and a half million women. That makes it as prevalent as mental illness, and not all sufferers are obese.The early apnea studies pioneered by Kryger and others showed that it damaged vital organs, and this work became a catalyst for medicine’s serious examination of sleep. Once it had been demonstrated that certain conditions associated with disrupted sleep could have dire clinical consequences, it became clear that sleep was a crucial factor in maintaining good health. The technology of the sleep laboratory provided insights into how other disorders can disrupt sleep, including Parkinson’s disease, esophageal reflux, hormonal dysfunction of the thyroid and pituitary glands, and traumatic brain injury. Where doctors had previously ascribed poor nighttime sleep to anxiety and daytime sleepiness to laziness or lack of motivation, they now began to view them as conditions worthy of diagnosis and treatment.Kryger’s book usefully outlines the current state of knowledge of sleep science in humans. The biology of sleep and wakefulness is complex, involving not just the one neural circuit I learned about in medical school but numerous pathways in the brain and countless chemical mediators. Kryger condenses this intricate neuroscience to explain the mechanisms that start and stop sleep: “a wake gauge and a body clock.” Just as a car’s fuel gauge tells us when we need to refill the tank, a “wake gauge” tells us when our body is in need of sleep. The gauge begins to signal after we have been awake for about fourteen hours, and increases in intensity until the eighteen-hour mark, after which we find it hard not to fall asleep. The wake gauge operates in the brain by means of a chemical called adenosine, which is involved in energy transfer. The longer our brain is active, the more adenosine accumulates and the sleepier we feel. (The reason coffee keeps us up is that caffeine counteracts the effects of adenosine.)The body clock synchronizes our need for sleep with the rhythms of the world around us. Daylight is the primary regulator. When light hits the eye’s retina, a wake-up signal is sent to a collection of cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, which keep time and monitor our sleep-wake cycle. At dusk, when light fades, the pineal gland (where Descartes believed the soul resided) releases melatonin and makes us drowsy. Melatonin regulates the circadian rhythm of a wide range of organisms; the molecule is found in bacteria, insects, jellyfish, and plants. The visual basis of human circadian rhythms is proved by the fact that people who are blind because of damage to the eye itself often have great difficulty synchronizing their body clocks, and suffer severe sleep problems, whereas people whose blindness is caused by lesions in the visual cortex (and whose eyes are undamaged) generally have a normal circadian system.Once we’ve finally nodded off, a variety of things occur. By tracking eye movements and using electroencephalograms to measure brain waves, researchers have identified four main types of sleep and have established that we typically progress through them in cycles of about ninety minutes. The first two stages move toward so-called “slow-wave” sleep, a state during which our neocortex powers down and which is thought to be largely responsible for the feeling of being refreshed when we wake. As we come out of slow-wave sleep, we go through a period of rapid-eye-movement sleep, or REM, one of the most commonly studied phases. Kryger calls REM the “enigmatic state.” During this phase, almost all of our muscles are paralyzed, except the diaphragm, which allows us to continue to breathe, and certain sphincters at the top and bottom of our gastrointestinal tract. Meanwhile, the brain shoots off “electrical storms,” resulting in rapid movements of the eyes, and we start to have vivid dreams. All humans dream, usually three to five times a night. And every time a man dreams he has an erection; every time a woman dreams, the blood vessels of her vagina become engorged. These changes in our genitalia are apparently unrelated to sexual thoughts before sleep or to sexual content in the dreams themselves. Rather, erections and vaginal engorgement seem to be the result of the state of dreaming itself.Even as we cycle through the various stages, our sleep is frequently interrupted by brief awakenings, called “arousals,” each lasting only seconds. Kryger writes that “healthy sleepers” typically experience about five awakenings an hour, although they do not remember them. Scientists speculate that these brief periods of wakefulness might have evolved so that we do not place ourselves in danger while asleep—suffocating under bedding, for example, or being vulnerable to attack by a predator.Kryger offers a comprehensive analysis of physical conditions that can impair our sleep. Women may experience insomnia owing to the normal hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle and to the changes in hormonal regulation that occur with menopause. (He is rightly cautious about whether so-called “andropause,” a decline in testosterone levels among one to two per cent of men as they age, also contributes to insomnia.) Restless-leg syndrome, which causes lower limbs to spontaneously move and often cramp, is associated with certain vitamin deficiencies but often occurs without a known reason. It is a common cause of disturbed sleep in the elderly, and treatment varies from replenishing the deficient vitamin to prescribing drugs that alter neurotransmitters in the brain.But for most of us it is the mind, rather than the body, that disrupts restorative sleep. Kryger explores in depth psychological conditions that are associated with disordered sleep, as well as psychotropic medications whose side effects can prevent a restful night. He allows for the need to medicate at times with sleeping pills or melatonin, but prefers cognitive behavioral therapy, a technique that involves teaching patients to mentally prepare themselves for slumber by devising ways to bypass the thoughts that keep them awake.There is useful advice for less chronic problems, like jet lag. Kryger explains the difference between flying east and flying west. If you take a morning flight from London to New York, you’ll most likely arrive in the afternoon, but your body thinks it’s night. He recommends avoiding sleep for more than a short nap. Instead, eat, watch movies, and, upon arrival, try to stay awake until it’s bedtime in the new location. When flying east, he recommends getting as much sleep as possible—asking the flight attendants not to interrupt you, and using earplugs and an eye mask. He offers other tips, such as shielding your eyes from sunlight until your body would normally awaken by wearing sunglasses for about two hours after landing: this helps reset the body’s clock.
The mysteries that surround sleep are not merely scientific and clinical but also cultural. In “Wild Nights” (Basic), Benjamin Reiss, a professor of English at Emory University, writes:Sleep is both a universal need and a freely available resource for all societies and even species. So why is it the source of frustration for so many people today? Why do we spend so much time trying to manage it and medicate it, and training ourselves—and our children—how to do it correctly? And why do so many of us feel that, despite all our efforts to tame our sleep, it’s fundamentally beyond our control?The fault, he believes, lies with our fixation on sleeping “in one straight shot through the night,” a schedule that conflicts with the natural sleep rhythms of many people. This fixation leads to “worry and micromanagement,” paradoxically worsening insomnia. Sleep aids end up causing more problems than they solve, making us “more intolerant of small changes to routine and environment, creating a society of fussy, stressed-out sleepers.”But what is “natural” when it comes to sleep? Reiss looks to the historian A. Roger Ekirch, who, in 2001, documented that in early-modern Europe and North America the standard pattern for nighttime sleep was “segmented.” There were two periods, sometimes termed “dead sleep” and “morning sleep,” with intervals of an hour or more when the person was awake, sometimes called “the watching,” during which people might pray or read or have sex. In some indigenous societies in Nigeria, Central America, and Brazil, segmented sleep persisted into the twentieth century. Ekirch hypothesized that segmented sleep was our natural, evolutionary heritage, and that it had been disrupted in the West by the demands of industrialization, and by electricity, which made artificial lighting ubiquitous. Reiss cites Ekirch, who asserted that the fact that many people experience insomnia in the middle of the night, after a few hours of sleep, indicates that our ancestral rhythms have been disrupted by modernization. However, other studies cited by Reiss challenge the idea of a universal model of sleep across millennia. Jerome Siegel, a neuroscientist at U.C.L.A., studied three contemporary hunter-gatherer societies in Tanzania, Namibia, and Bolivia. All of them lacked electricity and, he posited, occupied environments like those inhabited by early humans, so their sleep patterns most likely “represented the truly natural way to sleep.” None of the tribes experienced segmented sleep, but daytime naps were important, especially during the summer months. Reiss emphasizes that these tribes showed “none of the adverse health effects—including obesity, diabetes and mood disorders—that authorities so often link to sleep deprivation.”It seems questionable that humans have so changed psychologically and physically over the millennia that what keeps us awake today didn’t exist in the past. Reiss, a professor of English, is doubtless familiar with the many reflections on sleeplessness found in Shakespeare, whose Henry IV, conscience-stricken after seizing the throne, laments, “O sleep, O gentle sleep, Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frightened thee, that thou no more will weigh my eyelids down, and steep my senses in forgetfulness?”Reiss himself details insomnia remedies in the ancient world that included crisp lettuce leaves, nutmeg, dandelion, and onions. Restless nights existed, but, instead of swallowing Ambien or melatonin, people ingested soporific foods, following an Aristotelian belief that “warm vapors of digested food reach the brain.” Going back even further, undoubtedly the slumber of hunter-gatherers was sometimes disrupted by worry about access to food during dry seasons, say, or by envy of more successful tribe members.Before industrialization, sleep patterns were based largely on seasonal daylight. But the idea that modern industrial society alone is responsible for our discordant forms of sleep is belied by the taxing rhythms of agrarian life. Harvests required long days and late nights; cows would have been milked in the very early mornings, and shepherds, as the hymn says, watched their flocks by night, to save them from predators. Speaking of hymns, Reiss also ignores the demands that religious rituals have long made on daily schedules. In Judaism, there are three services for prayer: morning, afternoon, and night. (A famous passage in the Passover Haggadah has a student barging in on five rabbis who were up all night discussing the Exodus, telling them that the time had come for the morning Shema.) In Islam, the muezzin calls the faithful to prayer five times a day, beginning at dawn. And among monks, nuns, and devoted Catholic laity the “liturgy of the hours” specifies prayers every three hours, from Lauds, at 3 A.M., through to Vigils, at midnight.Reiss writes that his book’s “guiding spirit and lead witness” is Henry David Thoreau. Thoreau suffered from insomnia, and his retreat, in 1845, to a simple cabin at Walden Pond was, in part, driven by a desperate need for rest. Thoreau attributed his nightly struggles to the fact that railroads and other industrial changes had disturbed the natural environment around Concord. Reiss believes that we are victims of “the same environmentally devastating mind-set that Thoreau decried: an attitude of dominion over nature (including our own bodies) through technology and consumerism.” As the opposite of Thoreau, emblematic of everything he was reacting against, Reiss gives us Honoré de Balzac, who, while Thoreau was in Walden, was fuelling his writing with twenty to fifty cups of coffee a day, often on an empty stomach. Balzac believed that, with caffeine, “sparks shoot all the way to the brain,” and “forms and shapes and characters rear up; the paper is spread with ink.” Balzac typically wrote between fourteen and sixteen hours a day for two decades, producing sixteen volumes of “La Comédie Humaine” within six years. Thoreau rejected coffee as an artificial stimulant and suggested that communion with nature offered a superior high: “Who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes?”At the heart of “Wild Nights” is the tension between the stimulation of intense productivity and a longing for a lost Eden of relaxation. But did Eden ever really exist? The history of blaming modernity for lost sleep runs long. Where Thoreau once held railroads responsible for his insomnia, we now obsess over e-mail and social media and the glowing screens of our computers and smartphones. Societies have been looking for ways of forcing people to rest since at least the Iron Age, when the Sabbath tradition emerged in Judaism. As Kryger shows, sleep is utterly essential to life, organically speaking, but the act of living our lives to the fullest, with all the attendant toils, responsibilities, and worries, has probably always been the enemy of sleep. Even God needed a seventh day to rest from all that he created.",0
"Deutsche Bank Is First Bank Busted for Breaking Volcker Rule
Fed levies $157 million in fines for lax oversight of traders
In two probes, regulator faults oversight of trading and chats
Deutsche Bank AG was hit with the Federal Reserve’s first major fine for failing to ensure traders abide by the Volcker Rule’s ban on risky market bets -- and will also pay even more for letting currency desks chat online with competitors, allegedly revealing positions. The simultaneous sanctions, totaling almost $157 million, fault lax oversight of traders that persisted into last year. The company -- which raised $8.5 billion from investors this month to recapitalize -- admitted to the Fed in March 2016 that it still lacked adequate systems for keeping tabs on dealings that might run afoul of the Volcker ban.“Significant gaps existed across key aspects of Deutsche Bank’s Volcker Rule compliance program,” the Fed said Thursday, fining the firm $19.7 million for the lapses. As for chats, the bank failed to detect that currency traders engaged in “unsafe and unsound conduct,” disclosing some positions or talking about coordinating strategies, the Fed said. The company will pay $136.9 million for that.
Chief Executive Officer John Cryan, who took over almost two years ago, is trying to refocus on growth after probes and litigation sapped years of earnings, pushing the firm to tap investors to shore up capital. The latest penalties bring the lender’s total disclosed fines and legal settlements since the start of 2008 to $14.7 billion, the most of any European bank, and highlight the weakness of its controls after growing aggressively to compete with U.S. investment banks.“It’s pretty unpleasant that they stand out with the Volcker Rule violations,” Andreas Plaesier, an analyst at M.M. Warburg with a hold rating on Deutsche Bank shares, said by phone. “It’s really surprising just how many controls failed across the bank in recent years and it doesn’t cast a good light on former management.”While the bank had signaled that its misconduct in currency markets was less egregious than that of competitors, the penalty is “relatively low” and will probably be covered at least in part by existing reserves, Plaesier said.That fine was lower than penalties the Fed has imposed on other banks for similar issues. In 2015, the U.S. central bank slapped six banks with fines totaling more than $1.8 billion for their “unsafe and unsound practices in the foreign exchange markets.”Yet the Fed wasn’t the only regulator examining the currency chat rooms. New York’s Department of Financial Services, which has a track record of demanding stiffer penalties than the Fed, has been preparing to sanction the firm as well, a person familiar with the matter said last month.
“We are pleased to resolve these civil enforcement matters with the Federal Reserve,” said Renee Calabro, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, declining to comment further on Thursday’s cases. In December, the lender agreed to settle a U.S. mortgage-backed securities probe for $7.2 billion.The Volcker Rule, named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, seeks to make the financial system safer by barring banks with federally insured deposits from betting their own money. Such wagers once drove epic profits and bonuses in the years before 2008’s financial crisis.Now, traders are largely relegated to helping clients buy and sell securities, profiting mainly on the spread or price moves. And banks are supposed to ensure such market-making doesn’t bleed into outright wagers -- a line that can be blurry.Read more: Goldman said to prepare Volcker defense for $250 million traderThe Fed credited Deutsche Bank for taking steps to identify and shore up its policies and controls. It didn’t accuse the bank of engaging in banned proprietary trades.

Senior financial officials in the Trump administration havesaid they intend to rethink the Volcker Rule, which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who’s leading an effort to overhaul Dodd-Frank, has said Volcker went too far in choking off trading and should be made simpler to understand. The rule’s critics have suggested regulators appointed by President Donald Trump could just ease off on enforcing its toughest provisions.Transcripts of chats between Deutsche Bank traders and those from other banks emerged more than a year ago in civil litigation over the matter filed in Manhattan, and the U.S. Justice Department had been looking into the bank’s currency-trading activities. In March, the bank said the department had informed it that the U.S. criminal inquiry had been closed without action.In Thursday’s chat-room settlement, the Fed ordered the bank to improve its senior management’s oversight of foreign exchange trading and cooperate in any investigations of the individuals involved.The bank has been contending with other inquires this year. The U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan has been examining possible sanctions violations and “mirror trading” that moved billions of dollars out of Russia.— With assistance by Greg Farrell, Nicholas Comfort, and David Scheer

Netindividual taxes would go down $300 billion over 10 years, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Corporations and closely held companies, on the other hand, would see a net cut of $1 trillion.
And families passing large estates from one generation to the nextwould get the most concentrated and least justified tax break of all.The phased repeal of the estate tax in the House Republican measure would cost at least $172 billion over the next 10 years.
As soon asthe measure is enacted, the amount of an inheritance excluded from the federal tax would double, from $5.5 million to $11 million (or in the case of a couple passing on wealth, from $11 million to $22 million). That exclusion is certainly high enough to cover the vast majority offamily farms and businesses.Starting six years after enactment, the tax on inherited wealth above the exclusionlevels would drop from 40% to 0%.
Here's another way to look at it: The average American household might save $1,200 a year under the Republican tax plan. Meanwhile, the average familysubject tothe estate tax over the next 10 yearswouldsave about$3.2million. (If Trump were to leave, say, $3 billion to his heirs, they alone would save more than $1 billion.)
Why Congresswould want to concentrate so much savings on such an impossibly small sliver of people is hard to explain, except as a rewardto wealthyRepublican donors who've long been clamoring for repeal of what they call the ""death tax.""
Actually, dead people don't pay taxes. They're dead. And if government has to get revenue from somewhere, collectingit from people lucky enough to be born into ultra richfamilies isn't a bad place to turn.
Money raised from the estate tax each year is nearly enough to fund the combined budgets of the FBI, the Coast Guard and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is one of the fairest and least damaging taxes on the books. It reduces the burden on far less affluent taxpayers. It should not be eliminated.

"Finally Stein is finished! The recount many will no longer be on taxpayer’s backs!
Finally Stein is finished! The recount many will no longer be on taxpayer’s backs!
The big chunk of Americans, no matter the party or ideology have been furious with Green Party nominee Jill Stein’s attempts to initiate recounts inMichigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — which were crucial to President-elect Donald Trump’s victory.
Particularly in Michigan, where taxpayers would have had to give up on millions for thelost cause called a recount, couple of lawmakers were trying to pass legislation that would made sure nothing of this sorts will ever be imposed on the people.
The bill that got passed the MichiganHouse Elections Committee on Tuesday would make sure that candidates who lose the election by more than 5 percent would have to cover the entire expenses of the recount out of their own pockets.
As of now, Michigan law states that candidates who are filing for arecount(and have lost by more than 0.5 percent) must pay $125 per district for the recount.
In other words that Stein payed roughly $1 million for the recount and that Michigan taxpayers paid about $4 million, as noted byThe Detroit News.
Also, this current bill is of the retroactive kind, so it will take effect back to January 1, 2016. In other words, the big chunk of Stein’s$7 million war chestwould basically be confiscated by the state.
Many lawmakers have objected to that segment of the bill, and it was not certain whetherit would make it through after a Michigan judge practically ended the recountefforts in the state.
One thing is sure and that is that this bill will put astop on people like Stein from taking using taxpayers again and in vain, and also it would make sure that only truest liberal supporters of Stein or any other candidate in the future would essentially set aside the money to attend the recount’s needs.
Even though this is a crucial part of our democracy, the law should make sure that people are protected from using tax money in causes away from their liking.

"After a popular drug was given to Gena Norris, she nearly died and has suffered from its damages ever since—now they are suing.
On November 1, Chuck Norris and his wife Gena Norris announced a massive lawsuit against eleven different drug companies, including McKesson and Bracco, claiming they are responsible for nearly killing Gena.
“Unfortunately, litigation is the only course of action we can take to hold the drug companies accountable for threatening the lives of so many innocent people who undergo MRIs,” Gena said.
Gena and I have been in the news recently because of the gadolinium poisoning she received through her Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI, “a diagnostic technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed image of the body’s soft tissue and bones.”
We’re not overlooking the good MRIs can do. We’re speaking out against the dangers of gadolinium use in MRIs.
Gadolinium-based contrast agents, or GBCAs, are injected in about a third of 60 million MRIs performed annually – 30 million in the U. S. alone (that’s one in 10 Americans), including children.
Gadolinium is a heavy metal chemical agent that is injected to enhance the images of a MRI. It’s not naturally found in the human body. Its proponents say it is always expelled from the body, primarily through the kidneys. But studies have shown it can be retained in the brain, bones, skin and others parts of the body.
According to the lawsuit, Gena was poisoned by gadoliniumandsustained Gadolinium Deposition Disease following routine MRIs. Gena suffered long-term health implications requiring multiple hospitalizations and almost $2 million dollars in out-of-pocket medical expenses.
As Business wirereports, Gena Norris has experienced cognitive impairment, body pain/burning, kidney damage, loss of energy/mobility, and difficulty breathing. Now, almost five-years post-gadolinium poisoning, she continues to require regular stem cell therapies and other treatments to heal her central nervous system.
“These companies continue to say that there is no link between gadolinium and adverse events, even though the evidence is overwhelming that this heavy metal stays in the body for years, rather than hours,” said Gena.
To treat her condition, the Norris family has had to seek alternative care outside of mainstream medicine. The treatment they sought to remove the gadolinium from her body, which is not yet approved by the FDA to treat gadolinium poisoning, is chelation therapy.
Chelation therapyis a chemical process in which a synthetic solution-EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)-is injected into the bloodstream to remove heavy metals and/or minerals from the body. Chelation means “to grab” or “to bind.” When EDTA is injected into the veins, it “grabs” heavy metals and minerals such as lead, mercury, copper, iron, arsenic, aluminum, andcalciumand removes them from the body. Except as a treatment forlead poisoning, chelation therapy is controversial and unapproved.
Gena and Chuck are representedby Brooks Cutter and ToddWalburgofCutter Lawin California who were present in September whenthe U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted 13-1 (with one abstention) to add a warning about the risk of gadolinium retention after use of gadolinium-based contrast agents.
In October 2016, according to the firm, Cutter Law filed the first gadolinium deposition disease lawsuit against the maker of a gadolinium-based contrast agent, alleging patients were not properly warned about the risks associated with gadolinium retention. Since that time, they have filed several lawsuits for victims living across the country in both state and federal courts, Chuck and Gena included.
The lawsuit accuses the manufacturers of knowing about the risks associated with gadolinium but doing nothing about them.

"(Before It's News)Exceptionally preserved trilobite fossils from China, dating back to more than 500 million years ago, have revealed new insights into the extinct marine animal’s digestive system. The remarkable Chinese specimens contradict previous assumptions about trilobite digestive systems and evolution
This photo is of a specimen of the trilobite Palaeolenus lantenoisi from the Guanshan Biota in southern Yunnan Province, China. Rarely are internal organs preserved in fossils, but this specimen shows the digestive system preserved as reddish iron oxides. The digestive system is comprised of a crop (inflated region at top of specimen), lateral glands, and a central canal that runs along the length of the body; the iron oxides that extend beyond the fossil are the remains of gut contents that were extruded during preservation.

This photo is of a specimen of the trilobite Palaeolenus lantenoisi from the Guanshan Biota in southern Yunnan Province, China. Rarely are internal organs preserved in fossils, but this specimen shows the digestive system preserved as reddish iron oxides. The digestive system is comprised of a crop (inflated region at top of specimen), lateral glands, and a central canal that runs along the length of the body; the iron oxides that extend beyond the fossil are the remains of gut contents that were extruded during preservation.
Published today in the journal PLOS ONE, the new study shows that at least two trilobite species evolved a stomach structure 20 million years earlier than previously thought.
Trilobites are a group of extinct marine arthropods–distantly related to the horseshoe crab–that lived for almost 300 million years. They were extremely diverse, with about 20,000 species, and their fossil exoskeletons can be found all around the world. Most of the 270 specimens analyzed in the new study were collected from a quarry in southern Kunming, China, during an excavation led by Hopkins’ co-author, Zhifei Zhang, from Northwest University in Xi’an.
Previous research suggests that two body plans existed for trilobite digestive systems: a tube that runs down the length of the trilobite’s body with lateral digestive glands that would have helped process the food; or an expanded stomach, called a “crop”, leading into a simple tube with no lateral glands. Until now, only the first type had been reported from the oldest trilobites. Based on this, researchers had proposed that the evolution of the crop came later in trilobite evolutionary history and represented a distinct type of digestive system.
The Chinese trilobite fossils, about 20 percent of which have soft tissue preservation, are dated to the early Cambrian, about 514 million years ago. Contradictory to the previously proposed body plans, the researchers identified crops in two different species within this material. In addition, they found a single specimen that has both a crop and digestive glands–suggesting that the evolution of trilobite digestive systems is more complex than originally proposed.
The study backs up an earlier announcement made by a separate research team, which found evidence for the unusual crop and gland pairing in a single juvenile trilobite specimen from Sweden from the late Cambrian. But the Chinese material presents the oldest example of this complex digestive system in a mature trilobite, wiping away doubts that the dual structures might just be part of the animal’s early development.
“This is a very rigorous study based on multiple specimens, and it shows that we should start thinking about this aspect of trilobite biology and evolution in a different way,” Hopkins said.
This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Fossil collection was partly financed by the National 973 Program and 111 Project of China.",1

"Your flu risk may be linked to the year you were born
For most people, however, the seasonal flu virus, which mutates just a little bit every year, is not particularly severe because our immune systems have already probably seen a similar flu virus and thus know how to fight it. It's called native immunity or protection, and almost all of us have some degree of it.
Babies are more vulnerable because they haven't been exposed to the seasonal flu and older people because their immune systems may not be functioning as well.
Pandemic flu is a different animal, and you should understand the difference.
Pandemik/: pan means ""all""; demic (or demographic) means ""people."" It is well-named, because pandemic flu spreads easily throughout the world. Unlike seasonal flu, pandemics occur when a completely new or novel virus emerges. This sort of virus can emerge directly from animal reservoirs or be the result of a dramatic series of mutations -- so-called reassortment events -- in previously circulating viruses.
In either case, the result is something mankind has never seen before: a pathogen that can spread easily from person to defenseless person, our immune systems never primed to launch any sort of defense.
Our only hope
With pandemic flu, we cannot solely rely on our bodies' ability to fight. A vaccine is our only real hope.
That fact is part of the reason the number 24 was stuck in my head as I served as an executive producer on the CNN original film ""Unseen Enemy."" I have become convinced that if we can develop and deploy a pandemic flu vaccine just 24 weeks faster than is currently projected, the impact could change the course of human history.
Twenty-four weeks faster could mean the difference between 20,000 people dying in the next flu pandemic or more than 20 million people dying.
Flu spreads across 40 states
In the 20th century alone, we experienced serious flu pandemics. The Spanish Flu of 1918 was an unprecedented catastrophe. Experts' best estimates (before there was more formal census and record-keeping) were that 20% to 40% of the world became ill and more than 50 million people died.
In the United States alone, approximately 675,000 people died in just the eight months between September 1918 and April 1919. Some people died the same day they became ill, and others died within a few days from complications of the flu, such as pneumonia or meningitis.
Forty years later, the Asian flu of 1958 and 1959 had a global death toll as high as 2 million and an estimated 70,000 of those in the US alone.
Early in 1968, the year before I was born, the Hong Kong flu began. By September, it made its way around the world, including the United States, and became widespread by December. It is believed that the number of those infected peaked during the fall, when kids were at school, transmitting the virus more freely.
Still, as many as a million people died, 34,000 in the US alone between September 1968 and March 1969.
We are overdue
We have learned a lot over the past 100 years and are better prepared because of it. In the developed world, at least, we have the ability to ease suffering with antivirals, breathing machines and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections.
Experts can also more quickly characterize pathogens causing outbreaks. Although it took several years to identify the virus causing AIDS, for example, it took only a few weeks to identify the SARS virus.
We are also much faster at developing vaccines. According to research compiled by the science publication Mosaic, a typhoid vaccine was first tested in 1896 but only developed into a safe and effective vaccine nearly a hundred years later, in 1994. It took just 12 years, however, to develop a safe and effective Ebola vaccine (2003 to 2015). And, last week, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced initiation of a phase II trial for a Zika vaccine that started in August with the hope it may be ready for emergency use by 2018.
Most important, our production capabilities have increased tremendously around the world. In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, we had the ability to make only 350 million doses of flu vaccine, but now, in theory, we could make 5.4 billion doses of flu vaccine if we harnessed and aligned manufacturing facilities all over the world.
24 weeks faster?
Would it ever be possible, however, to create and distribute a vaccine 24 weeks faster -- in six weeks instead of 30 weeks -- and save more than 20 million lives?
For starters, the way we typically make flu vaccine is still pretty antiquated and hasn't changed much in nearly 70 years.
We rely largely on hens' eggs to incubate and replicate the virus, which is too slow of a process to respond rapidly to pandemic flu.
Are we ready for the next global epidemic?
Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, told me that recent scientific advances, however, are fully transforming the speed at which vaccines can be developed and approved.
Genomic techniques can be used to map the DNA or RNA of a new pathogen, genetically to engineer and mass-produce the same DNA or RNA and then inject it into the human body, leading to the production of antibodies to fight the virus. This method results in a new type of vaccine, a DNA vaccine.
Faster development and production is one critical step to shortening the vaccine process by 24 weeks.
Another is more robust surveillance systems everywhere in the world. As we were reminded with Ebola and Zika, an infection anywhere can be an infection everywhere.
The first time an ill patient shows up at a hospital anywhere on the planet with a novel virus, the clock starts ticking.
Improved surveillance means that hospital staff has to be astute enough to recognize that the patient doesn't fit the normal patterns we were taught in medical school and start to investigate further.
After that, there has to be speedy and accurate identification of the virus, purification and sequencing of the genetic material and then immediate sharing of the knowledge (via the cloud) enabling researchers everywhere to get to work on the development of new vaccines. After this genetically engineered vaccine is developed, it would have to be manufactured in the billions and then distributed to every city in the world.

To make this a reality, it will take unprecedented partnerships between governments, even those at odds with each other. It will take the public and private sector working together every step of the way to ensure that the newly created vaccine can be distributed, trusted and administered.
It will take research and development money, as it always does, to bolster the techniques and infrastructure I described and make them available everywhere.
And it will take accepting that a pandemic of flu is likely in our lifetime. But with preparation and imagination, it need not be as nearly catastrophic as it was 50 or 100 years ago.
Make no mistake, outbreaks -- sudden, unexpected and localized eruptions of infection -- are inevitable. But, as epidemiologist Larry Brilliant (who spearheaded the effort to eradicate Small Pox), puts it: pandemics can be optional.

"""An urgent and expert investigation into behavioral addiction, the dark flipside of today's unavoidable digital technologies, and how we can turn the tide to regain control.  Behavioral addiction may prove to be one of the most important fields of social, medical, and psychological research in our lifetime. The idea that behaviors can be being addictive is new, but the threat is near universal. Experts are just beginning to acknowledge that we are all potential addicts. Adam Alter, a professor of psychology and marketing at NYU, is at the cutting edge of research into what makes these products so compulsive, and he documents the hefty price we're likely to pay if we continue blindly down our current path.  People have been addicted to substances for thousands of years, but for the past two decades, we've also been hooked on technologies, such as Instagram, Netflix, and Facebook—inventions that we've adopted because we assume they'll make our lives better. These inventions have profound upsides, but their extraordinary appeal isn't an accident. Technology companies and marketers have teams of engineers and researchers devoted to keeping us engaged. They know how to push our buttons, and how to coax us into using their products for hours, days, and weeks on end.  Tracing the very notion of addiction through history right up until the present day, Alter shows that we're only just beginning to understand the epidemic of behavioral addiction gripping society. He takes us inside the human brain at the very moment we score points on a smartphone game, or see that someone has liked a photo we've posted on Instagram. But more than that, Alter heads the problem off at the pass, letting us know what we can do to step away from the screen. He lays out the options we have address this problem before it truly consumes us. After all, who among us has struggled to ignore the ding of a new email, the next episode in a TV series, or the desire to play a game just one more time?

US Troops Throw Babies From Incubators, Gun Down Women And Children
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
A deeply shocking report written by the Foreign Ministry and released today by top Russian officials requesting anonymity claims that solid evidence has now been established linking US Special Forces Troops with the killing of at least 15 newborn babies in Bahrain and over 120 women and children in Syria.
According to this report, undercover Russian agents posted in Bahrain last year were able to secretly record the destruction of the Salmaniya Medical Complex, once one of the most renowned medical facilities in the Gulf and a jewel in the crown of Bahrain's public healthcare system, an attack so horrific it transformed this place of healing into a virtual ghost town. [Photo 2nd left]
According to eyewitness reports collected by Human Rights Watch, hospital staff personal reported that Bahraini security and military forces attacked the Salmaniya Medical Complex because they were treating protesters wounded by those forces employed by the monarchy to brutalize and subjugate the Shiite majority population of their country and keep them from establishing a democracy.
Especially brutal about the attack on the Salmaniya Medical Complex, this report continues, was the throwing of newborn babies out of their incubators who were then left to die on the floor without care because all of the doctors were arrested. News reports from Bahrain today state that 9 of these doctors, who were not allowed to attend their trial, were sentenced to long prison terms for daring to help injured protesters as that was considered by the monarchy to be a crime against the state.
This report further notes that at least 8 of the military leaders who led the attack against the Salmaniya Medical Complex in Bahrain have, also, been indentified by Russian agents in Syria as leading rebel forces linked to 4 massacres and the execution of men, women and children. [Photo 3rd left]
According to this report, the linking of these military leaders to both Bahrain and Syria was done through the use of facial recognition technology who, most shockingly, further indentified them as being members of the elite US Navy Seals Special Forces stationed in Bahrain with the US Navys 5th Fleet which is headquartered there.
Not being reported to the American people about the Bahrain Uprising is that the Obama regime has sided with its monarchy to keep these people from being able to establish a democracy and, in fact, used its Navy Seals to coordinate and engineer an invasion of Bahrain by Saudi Arabian military forces to keep their illegitimate puppet regime in power. Even worse, the Obama regime announced last month that it was resuming arms sales to Bahrain even as this brutal monarchy continues to kill its own citizens.
In a further confirmation of this report, Stephen Lendman, writer and radio host from Chicago in an interview this past week with Irans Press TV News Service, said the CIA and MI6 special forces are, also, in Syria now directing massacres.
Most astounding about all of these events, this report says, has been the United States mainstream media failing to report to the American people their nations plan to take over the entire the Middle East through war, and which was admitted to by one of the their most revered generals this past year.
In a most shocking interview [see video HERE] General Wesley Clark revealed the US plan to invade and take over 7 countries,  Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran, before the US had even invaded Afghanistan. The first part of the plan was revealed 10 days after 11 September 2001 and was expanded to include the other nations. General Clark is quoted as saying these invasions werent based on links to al-Queda, or any other intelligence reports, but just because the US has an army that is great at taking over other nations.
Curious to note about the United States master plan for the Middle East, this report continues, is that is centered on backing radical Sunni Muslims who have now taken control in Tunisia, Morocco, Libya and are now at war in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.
Even more curious, the Obama regime is being backed in is efforts by the least democratic nation in the entire Islamic world, Saudi Arabia, which not only doesnt allow its citizens to vote, it also outlaws all religious freedom and women rights.  And for a nation which openly beheads homosexuals and last month banned them from all schools, one does, indeed, wonder how Obama (who is called a champion of gay rights) can embrace such a regime.
And in a case of the absurd meeting the ridiculous, the US this past week accused Russia of supplying Syria with attack helicopters that are being used to kill innocent civilians.
The problem with this accusation, however, and as pointed out by Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, was that not only was Russia not supplying Syria with attack helicopters, the US Pentagon itself was forced to admit this Obama regime lie was not true.
The truth, though, has not stopped the American mainstream media propagandists from endlessly repeating this falsehood as the US Military has just announced their plans for the invasion of Syria are now in place.
To what the American people can look forward to as their military forces continue their savage rampage around the globe they need look no further than the example of Nazi Germany, who like the US of today dreamed of a world empire that would last a thousand years.but at the cost of over 100 million dead came up woefully short.

Due to our missions conflicts with that of those governments, the responses of their agents against us has been a longstanding misinformation/misdirection campaign designed to discredit and which is addressed in the report Who Is Sorcha Faal?.]

"Ransomware got a proverbial shot in the arm earlier this year following the WannaCry attacks and it looks as if hackers are getting more brazen with their requests as a result.
Web hosting company Nayana, based in South Korea, was attacked with the Erebus ransomware on June 10. The company ultimately had to pay a fee of 397.6 Bitcoin (approximately $1 million), the largest ransomware paid ever.
This came after several rounds of negotiations with the hackers, who initially asked for more than $4 million in Bitcoin.
The company made the announcement in a blogpost.
By comparison, the hackers behind the WannaCry attack only demanded $300 from each of its victims.
Nayana said that 153 of its Linux-based servers were infected and the attack affected approximately 3,400 customers who use its products for hosting websites, multimedia content and other services.
""We will do our best to make every service normalized as soon as possible,"" Nayana CEO Hwang Chilghong said in the statement, according to Google translate. ""With this work, we will improve the security of the vulnerable areas with government agencies as much as possible.""
According to TrendLabs Security Intelligence, Nayana was only able to recover the files and pay a lower ransom than initially proposed because it could not afford the initial figure.
Researchers have shown that cyber attacks rose more than 700 percent in 2016 from 2015 levels, with approximately $1 billion paid in ransom. Those numbers are likely to increase, thanks in part to the response seen from the WannaCry attack and others like it.",0

"Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan said he isn’t sure exactly how many illegal immigrants are in the U. S.
There could be more than 11 to 12 million in the country, he said. No matter how many there are, Homan said that President Donald Trump’s executive orders have put every illegal immigrant (except those covered by President Obama’s amnesty for illegal aliens who arrived as minors) up for deportation.
He recently spoke at a White House press briefing in which he said that no illegal immigrant should “be comfortable,” and he reiterated that message during Tuesday’s interview.
“One thing President Trump did with the executive orders is he took the handcuffs off of officers. Now they can enforce the laws enacted by Congress,” Homan told TheDC. “The executive orders could’ve been written in one sentence: ‘You are now allowed to enforce the law as written.’ There’s been a lot of people off the table. Now there’s no population off the table anymore.”
The acting ICE directorsaid during the briefing that there are “11 million to 12 million” illegal immigrants in the U. S.The Pew Research Center pegged the number at 11 million illegal immigrants in 2015.(RELATED: EXCLUSIVE — ICE Director Stares Down MS-13: ‘My Gang Is Bigger Than Theirs’)
“Like everybody else, I see studies and reports, and 11-12 million is the steady number I’ve seen. Could it be higher? It probably could be,” Homan said Tuesday. When asked if the government should look more into what that figure actually is, Homan replied, “I think the more information we have, the better off we are. If there’s somebody that wants to look into that, then I support that.”
As a candidate, Trump said the government “has no idea” how many illegal immigrants are the country. “It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million,” Trump said.
The Trump administration has arrested at least 66,000 individuals known or suspected of being in the country illegally. Homan said in a 2016 event that the U. S. could potentially deport 400,000 illegal immigrants per year. He told TheDC that ICE officers could deport even more if the backlog in immigration courts could be addressed.
some individuals won’t have their first hearing in immigration court until 2021. The average waiting time in immigration cases is 670 days. The Trump administration, specifically Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is supportive of hiring new immigration judges.
Homan also addressed the plummet in border apprehensions during the Trump administration. Border apprehensions, which is the most commonly used figure to determine border crossings, reached a 17-year low in April. “That is directly related to this President and his policies and executive orders,” the acting director said.
Homan has stepped into the role in January after serving as the executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations. Breitbart recently attacked Homan in anarticlethat said he was responsible for the release of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants, including sex offenders and murders, during his time in the Obama administration.
The acting ICE director told TheDC that this “couldn’t be farther from the truth.”
He said the number of individuals released due to the discretion of ICE officials fell from 21,796 in fiscal year 2013 — when he took over — to 5,740 in fiscal year 2016. Not only have the numbers as a whole fallen, but ICE discretionary releases now represent less than 30 percent of all criminal alien releases. This is a drop from 62 percent in fiscal year 2013.
Homan told TheDC in a follow-up interview Wednesday that he isn’t “happy” with the release of 5,740 criminal aliens, and that he has his “hands tied” due to certain statutes and court decisions. He described this as “something I have to deal with and something I’m fighting against.” One of the ways the acting director is working to eliminate discretionary releases is by asking Congress to increase the amount of detention space to 51,000 beds from around 34,000 beds.
He said this would allow him to “hang on to as many people as I can.”
The Breitbart story knocking Homan also included a quote from Chris Crane, the head of the national ICE council, that said Homan is an “Obama holdover.”
“I’ve been doing this job for going on 34 years. I like to consider myself a Ronald Reagan holdover because I was hired under his administration,” Homan said in response.",1
"Lifetime leeching politician, Maxine Waters (D-CA) calls for President Trump to be impeached on a regular basis for his supposed ties to Russia.
It turns out that Maxine Waters has plenty of her own money invested in Russia.
According to Waters’ most recently available House financial disclosure documents, she held $200,000 in Russia-linked retirement accounts. Tsk Tsk!
California Democrat Representative Maxine Waters held $200,000 in Russia-linked retirement accounts in 2015, even while she hypocritically calls for President Donald J. Trump’s impeachment over his financial connections to Russia, according to her most recently available House financial disclosure documents.
Waters’s cash-grabbing shamelessness has never known bounds. In 2012, she barely squeaked through a three-year House Ethics Committee investigation after abusing her position to funnel $12 million in bailout money to her husband’s bank.
Her Russian investments will surprise no one in her district, where impromptu signs declaring the congresswoman a “poverty pimp” and a race baiter have been popping up for years.
Waters’ 2015 disclosure statement details her family’s investments in BlackRock’s Russia-connected Global Allocation and Balanced funds.
2015 SEC filings for both fundsadvise of their involvement in Russian precious metals and securities:
A Fund may invest in the equity securities of companies that explore for, extract, process or deal in precious metals (e.g., gold, silver and platinum), and in asset-based securities indexed to the value of such metals. … The major producers of gold include the Republic of South Africa, Russia, Canada, the United States, Brazil and Australia. … A Fund may invest a portion of its assets in securities issued by companies located in Russia.
A Sept. 2015 BlackRock Balanced SEC filing reveals her fund’s nearly $2.8 million in obligations to the Russian Federation.
Plus, Waters’ BlackRock Global fund held $3 million in Russian assets, at the same time her family profited!
Especially as, this year, the investors handling Waters’ retirement account are excited todump more client money into the land of Vladimir Putin.
Sorry haters, Russia has survived sanctions. It survived $35 oil. And it survived two years of recession. Say what you will about Vladimir Putin, Russia’s economic management team has got its stuff together. And for that reason, BlackRock says Russia is a buy.
“What gets all of the attention regarding Russia is the geopolitics. But for all the negative opinion you can have out there on Russia, from an economic standpoint it’s been amazing. We are overweight Russian equities,” says Gerardo Rodriguez, a fund manager with BlackRock in New York.",1
"A road trip is the perfect way to travel, especially if you feel like seeing multiple places in one go. You just grab some food and water, fill up the tank, and hop in the car.

Take your adventure to the next level and travel in a motorhome. Why not extend the good times by a few more days or even weeks? RV camping means you can live in relative luxury almost anywhere. Give in to the lure of the open road; the kids will love the experience, too.

It is not known to what degree Cuba was involved in the attack. A US official said elements within the Cuba government must have ""facilitated"" the attack on some level because Cuba's security services exercise such a tight grip over the country.
The source also said it is possible that the people behind the attack did not realize the extent of the damage they caused. One US diplomat now will need to use a hearing aid as a result of the injuries they suffered, according to the source.
The attacks have stopped ""at least for now,"" according to the same source.
'Physical symptoms'
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert on Wednesday said that ""some US government personnel"" working at the US embassy in Havana, Cuba on official duty reported some incidents that were causing ""physical symptoms."" But she could not elaborate on the nature or cause of the incidents.
""Because there are a variety of symptoms, there could be a variety of sources,"" one US official said. ""That is why we are being very careful here with what we say. There is a lot we still don't know.""
For years US diplomats in Havana complained that they suffered harassment from Cuban officials and frequently had their homes and cars broken into. But diplomats said that after the US and Cuba restored full diplomatic ties in 2015, the campaign of harassment stopped.
Some of those affected chose to return to the US, said Nauert, prompting the administration to expel two Cuban diplomats from the embassy in Washington in May.
""The Cuban government has a responsibility and an obligation under the Geneva convention to protect our diplomats,"" Nauert told reporters, ""so that is part of the reason why this is such a major concern of ours.""

A statement from the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday categorically denied any Cuban involvement in the mistreatment of US diplomats in Cuba, and said the decision to expel Cuban diplomats was ""unjustified and unfounded.""

"NEW YORK — 18-year old daughter of the late Michael Jackson, Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson has received on behalf of his dad, $825 million as his earnings in 2016.
The former pop icon tops Forbes‘ list of highest-paid dead celebrities, beating out other iconic superstars like Elvis Presley and Prince.
Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, who is an Actress and Model may not have to work much but rather free much of her time to spend her dad’s money with her other two siblings Prince and Joseph.
The money made by the dead Michael Jackson surpasses that made by the living Floyd Mayweather and Jay Z in the year 2016.
Forbes is yet to rank Jackson’s children.
According to the Forbes, Jacko earned an impressive $825 million in 2016 thanks in large part to his investment in the Sony/ATV music publishing catalog, which is known for its The Beatles songs. He originally paid $47.5 million in 1985 to buy the catalog. Sony, which paid him $115 million for a 50/50 partnership, then purchased the late singer’s half for $750 million earlier this year.
“Jackson’s total pretax payday of $825 million ranks as the biggest annual haul by any celeb dead or alive,” said Forbes.",1

Tension between LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers’ leadership is centered on payroll spending, multiple sources told ESPN.
James and team owner Dan Gilbert have different viewpoints on the issue, and it has been straining the relationship, sources said. The matter has been exacerbated by the team’s struggles on the court; the Cavs lost for the sixth time in eight games, 116-112 to the Sacramento Kings in overtime, on Wednesday night.
When James was considering a return to the Cavs in 2014, he pressed Gilbert on if he’d be willing to spend unconditionally on talent, regardless of the luxury-tax cost, sources said. Over the course of several meetings with James and his representatives, Gilbert agreed, and James subsequently signed with the team.
Gilbert paid $82 million in salaries and $7 million in luxury tax in 2014-15, when the Cavs reached the NBA Finals. Last season, when Cleveland won the championship, Gilbert paid $107 million in salaries and $54 million in luxury tax.
Currently, the Cavs (30-14) are committed to $127.6 million in salaries and $27 million in luxury taxes for this season. They have spent more than any other NBA team over the three-year span.
James, however, has grown frustrated. He perceives that the Cavaliers have slowed new spending after winning their first championship, sources said.
On Monday night, after a loss in New Orleans, James may have been referring to the team’s recent money decisions when he said, “I just hope that we’re not satisfied as an organization.”
James followed that up with a series of tweets: “I not mad or upset at management ’cause [general manager David Griffin] and staff have done a great job, I just feel we still need to improve in order to repeat … if that’s what we wanna do.”
The comments angered Gilbert, sources said, because James appeared to imply it was an organizational choice whether to improve or not. This was seen by some as a reference to further spending.
“The comment about the organization being complacent I think is really misguided,” Griffin said Wednesday. “Organizationally, there is absolutely no lack of clarity on what our goal set is. We are here to win championships. … Anyone insinuating that this organization is about anything other than that would deeply upset me because ownership has invested in this at an absolutely historic level.”
Several times over the last month, James has called on the team to add a player, preferably a ball handler.
When the Cavs traded for Kyle Korver earlier this month, they saved several million by reducing payroll and also opened a roster spot. The team has elected to leave the spot open for the past three weeks.
If the Cavs were to add a player, it would cost them the new salary plus an additional $2.50 per dollar in tax for roughly the next $600,000 they would spend. After that, the penalty would increase to $3.25 in tax per new dollar spent.
In addition to the open roster spot that could be used to sign a player, the Cavs have several trade exceptions — including one for $4.8 million and one for $4.4 million — that could be used to acquire players. The team also has the option to execute a player-for-player trade that could increase payroll.
Griffin said those options remain on the table, but he also made it clear he didn’t feel the team needed to spend.
“We can absolutely increase payroll if it’s the right piece at the right time. I’ve never once been given a mandate of any kind, relative to money,” Griffin said. “We’re not going to do something where we go ask for more money unless we believe it makes us appreciably better. … As we have all along, ownership will do what needs to be done.”
Last season, after he agreed to spend nearly $300 million in new contracts, Gilbert said: “We’re committed. We’re all-in. … When you invest in something like a sports franchise and you’re in for so much … [if] you, at the margins, start pulling back, I think that may be foolish on a lot of fronts.”
In addition to his displeasure about spending, James has hinted he’s upset at some of the way the back end of the roster was assembled. On Monday, James mentioned that veterans like Raymond Felton and Michael Beasley signed contracts for the league minimum with other teams in the offseason. He also referenced veteran Dahntay Jones, who was on the Cleveland roster for the playoffs and was released in the preseason.
The Cavs have young, less experienced players like Kay Felder, DeAndre Liggins and Jordan McRae on their roster.
“No disrespect to DeAndre and to Kay, you think we can rely on them to help us win a playoff game right now?” James said. “And it’s no disrespect to them. But it’s like, it’s not fair to them.”
Griffin responded to that by saying he felt the team needed to improve from within, not necessarily by adding a more experienced player at this time.
“We believe in this team at a deep level, and we need to get better from within and play better, quite frankly,” Griffin said. “We need to have a greater sense of urgency and start to develop a championship identity. I think it’s clear we have not been doing that.”
The Cavs changed their normal schedule Wednesday and held a meeting before the game. Griffin met with James individually, and coach Ty Lue met with the whole team in the wake of James’ comments from Monday.
“It was a good conversation,” Griffin said. “I think we both needed it. I’m happy it happened.”
After signing one-year contracts in 2014 and 2015, James signed a two-year, $64 million contract last summer. He holds a player option for $36 million for the 2018-19 season.

"Photobucket has long been a useful service for eBay and Amazon sellers as they can use it to host images for their listings.
However, the company has just decided to begin charging anyone who uses its photo service for hotlinking, as it's known. The unexpected move has caused chaos for many online sellers as images of their products have suddenly been replaced with a rather ugly message urging them to update their account to enable third-party hosting.
Logging into their account, affected users have been upset to discover that Photobucket is now requesting a hefty $400 a year for hosting services when up to now it was available as a free service.
Other sites like Etsy have also been hit by the updated terms, as have bloggers and other website users that have been uploading pictures to Photobucket before embedding them in their site.
The change means that across the web, billions of images -- Photobucket claims to host more than 10 billion in all -- have suddenly disappeared from a huge number of websites, replaced by a message urging the user to take action.
It seems that the firm gave little notice to its users of the change, leaving many ecommerce listings and other sites without their original images. Not surprisingly, users are not happy about the current situation, which means they'll either have to start forking out $400 a year or go through the laborious process of finding a new hosting site and performing the necessary uploads and embeds.
Many hit Twitter to voice their anger, with some users saying they've ditched the service and others threatening to do so.
Since the company launched in 2003, most of its income has come from ads that users see when they hit the site to upload images, but Photobucket is clearly intent on expanding its revenue sources.
A recent blog post by Denver-based Photobucket about the move was short and to the point, saying only that it was committed to providing the best experience and services for all of your photo and image needs and that users should review its updated terms of service.
The company describes itself as the premier destination for uploading, downloading, sharing, linking and finding photos, videos, and graphics. The service has 23 million monthly unique users in the U. S. and 100 million globally who upload over four million images and videos per day.
We've reached out to the company for comment and will update when we hear back.",0

"On April 22, the Department of Justice announced that Deutsche Bank had agreed to pay $2.5 billion for their role in the Libor fraud scandal. The manipulation of Libor rates is the largest criminal fraud in the history of finance, and had affected interest rates for billions of loans and credit transactions over the past 10 year period.
And as is par for the course in today’s oligarchical system, no indictments or jail time will be submitted against personnel within Deutsche Bank, or the myriad of other institutions culpable in the fraud.
Benjamin M. Lawsky, Superintendent of Financial Services, announced today that Deutsche Bank will pay $2.5 billion, terminate and ban individual employees who engaged in misconduct, and install an independent monitor for New York Banking Law violations in connection with the manipulation of the benchmark interest rates, including the London Interbank Offered Bank (“LIBOR”), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (“TIBOR”) (collectively, “IBOR”).
The overall $2.5 billion penalty Deutsche Bank will pay includes $600 million to the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), $800 million to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), $775 million to the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and 227 million GBP (approximately $340 million) to the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Superintendent Lawsky said: “Deutsche Bank employees engaged in a widespread effort to manipulate benchmark interest rates for financial gain. While a number of the employees involved in misconduct have already left the bank, those that remain are being terminated or banned from the New York banking system. We must remember that markets do not just manipulate themselves: It takes deliberate wrongdoing by individuals.” – DFS.NY.Gov
As noted above in the New York Department of Financial Services’s (DFS) press release, manipulation occurred through the actions of people, not by machines or bad processes, which makes the crime a willful act, and would be subject to criminal charges and indictments if America lived in an era where we actually jailed financial criminals.
Libor rates represent the interest that banks use when transferring money back and forth among themselves, which is then used to fund business loans, credit cards, mortgages, and even student loans to the public. Thus a rise in the libor rate would mean extra money a borrower has to pay over the life of a loan or credit transaction, with that additional interest funneling up to the banks in the amount of hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars in ill-gotten gains.
Deutsche Bank is just one of many institutions involved in the rigging of the Libor Rate, although they along with J. P. Morgan Chase are two the biggest. And with a simple fine of $2.5 billion being assessed to the German bank yesterday, it gives no incentive for them not to continue to de-fraud the system since the rewards far outweigh the risk should they get ever get caught.

Green Comet Of Doom Gives Grave Warning As Gulf Apocalypse Grows
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
In our January 1, 2005 report titled Now Visible Comet Heralds Warning of Doom to World we had stated that the appearance of the newly discovered Comet Machholz was a harbinger of ill tidings for humanity as this green astral visitor to our Solar System was well known by our ancient ancestors to be directed by the messenger of the gods Hermes whose duty was to guide the souls of the dead down to the underworld.
So powerful was this green comets message to humanity that on January 20, 2005 a solar flare from our Suns surface released the highest concentration of protons ever directly measured, taking only 15 minutes after observation to reach Earth, indicating a velocity of approximately one-half light speed.
Today this green harbinger of doom has returned during the most auspicious time of the Summer Solstice causing our Sun to hurl a massive cloud of magnetized plasma into space in one of the biggest explosions of its type this year as Comet Machholz approaches and it becomes visible to the unaided eye to all who live on our Planet.
To a modern World long taught that the warnings of the ancients were to be ignored as nothing more than superstitious myths, our Suns exploding during Comet Machholzs 2005, and now 2010 visit undoubtedly stands as nothing more than a coincidence, but one which cant be ignored as we stand on the cusp of an apocalypse of truly Biblical proportions as the Gulf of Mexico oil catastrophe now threatens to destroy us all.
The United States President, Barack Obama, acknowledged the gravity of this apocalypse when in addressing his people this past week ended with words evoking the power of the gods to save his country, and as we can read:
The oil spill is not the last crisis America will face. This nation has known hard times before and we will surely know them again. What sees us through  what has always seen us through  is our strength, our resilience, and our unyielding faith that something better awaits us if we summon the courage to reach for it. Tonight, we pray for that courage. We pray for the people of the Gulf. And we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm towards a brighter day.
Obamas asking for the the hand that could guide the American people towards a brighter day more than anything else sums up the catastrophic situation our whole World now finds itself in, and the Green Comet of Doom had warned about, in that unlike any other tragedy to befall us this one has the power to destroy for all time life as we know it.
To fully understand this one has to realize what oil is, and what it isnt.
From earliest childhood students are taught that oil comes from the decaying of ancient biomass (dead dinosaurs, plants, etc.), this is known as theory of biological petroleum origin.
Standing opposed to the biological theory of petroleum is what is called the abiogenic petroleum hypothesis that says petroleum was formed from deep carbon deposits, perhaps dating to the formation of the Earth. The presence of methane on Saturn's moon Titan is cited as evidence supporting the formation of hydrocarbons without biology.
Simply put, one theory (biological) states that oil as a byproduct of biomass decay can only be found at depths not exceeding 5,000 feet as any lower depths would bring drilling rigs into direct confrontation will our Earths geothermal forces that are still not fully understood.  The other theory (abiogenic) states that oil is a byproduct of our Earths inner geothermal forces and all existing (but soon running out) wells were vast underground caverns where it had seeped into over millions of years from tens, if not hundreds of thousands of feet below the surface of our Planet.
During the 20th Century, Soviet scientists were the main proponents of the abiogenic theory of oil and in December, 1962 released a report titled Contemplated Super-Deep Drilling in The Soviet Union that served as the blueprint for drilling what are called deep wells.  The first of these deep wells to be drilled by the Soviets was fraught with such disastrous consequences due to the internal pressures of our Earth that on September 30, 1966 they had to seal it using an atomic bomb 1.5 times the strength of the Hiroshima bomb and at a depth of 1.5 kilometers.
In all the Soviets eventually had to use atomic bombs on 5 deep wells they had dug with only the Kola Superdeep Borehole at 40,230 feet (12,262 meters) drilled in 1989 still existing today. The Kola Superdeep Borehole is the deepest hole ever drilled, and the deepest artificial point on the Earth.
Western oil companies in learning from the mistakes of the Soviets had since the 1970s confined their drilling of oil wells to depths of less than 30,000 feet (9,144 meters), that is until BPs Deepwater Horizon oil rig drilled the deepest oil well in history at a vertical depth of 35,050 ft (10,683 meters) and measured depth of 35,055 ft (10,685 meters) in September, 2009.
In April, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon, sitting 5,000 above the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico, drilled to a depth of 18,000 feet (5,486 meters) when by all accounts it was hit with a massive pressure blowback estimated to be over 100,000 pounds per square inch (psi) that shot a column of methane gas and oil up the drilled well with such force it destroyed this aircraft carrier size drilling rig, along with blowing out all the well casing making relief wells useless, and unleashing a catastrophe of such proportions it now endangers our entire World.
Important to note about the 100,000 psi number is that current engineering technology cannot contain gas that is pressurized that high.  Even worse is that the enormous pressure coming from deep within our Earth is from what is estimated to be a massive 15 to 20 mile toxic and explosive bubble of methane gas trapped for eons under the Gulf of Mexico sea floor that should it shatter would kill millions.
So potentially catastrophic is this situation it has led Texas A&M University oceanographer John Kessler to not only state that this is the most vigorous methane eruption in modern human history, it could also to turn the entire Gulf of Mexico into a what he calls a dead zone.
As to what is turning the United States worst environmental disaster in history into a catastrophe of truly Biblical proportions is the fracturing of the Gulf of Mexico seafloor that we had previously reported on in our June 10th report Scientists Warn Gulf Of Mexico Sea Floor Fractured Beyond Repair and was further confirmed by BP three days ago in their grudgingly acknowledging that their crippled blowout preventer is indeed leaning and could fall over.
Should BPs blowout preventer indeed fall over the estimated 4.2 million gallons of oil currently flowing into the Gulf of Mexico could easily rise to over 50 million gallons a day in the worst case scenario envisioned by scientists as a volcano like eruption of the seafloor spews continuously, and there is no stopping it.
Though not reported to the American people by their propaganda media, Obama knew within 3 hours of the Deepwater Horizons explosion the full extent of this tragedy as US Coast Guard documents clearly show their estimates of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico to be between 64,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil a day. The American people were told it was not over 5,000.
Even worse, right from the beginning of this disaster Obama has refused all help offered to the United States from the Netherlands, Norway, Russia and a dozen other countries around the World and has refused to even consider the nuclear option used by the Soviets to stop these types of leak disasters leading one to ask why?
In our June 16th report titled Obama To Earn Nearly $85 Million From Gulf Oil Disaster we directed you to some possible answers to this question of why in pointing out the billions of dollars being made by so many of Americas elite because of this catastrophe, but US propaganda media sources still refuse to tell these truths to their people.
Important to note too about this ongoing catastrophe is that it joins the ranks of such other disasters as 9/11 and the Titanic sinking (to just name two of the many examples) to have been foretold about in popular fiction when in 1903 the Austrian poet and occultist Gustav Meyrink wrote a novella titled Petroleum, Petroleum about a massive oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico eventually covering all of the Earths oceans causing rain to cease falling and the collapse of humanity.
To what will be the final outcome of this disaster it is not in our knowing.  What is in our knowing though are the many warnings, the Green Comet of Doom chief among them, our ancient ancestors passed to us through their many myths and legends, all of which point to a time when man would turn away from the signs of the heavens and put his knowledge above that of the gods leading to his destruction.
For those like us who write about these things (and we become fewer by the day) we are met with much ridicule and derision, at the best and unspeakable attacks, at the worst. But as the signs and our most ancient history clearly show, those who fail to listen now will perish, they always have. On the other hand, those who see without their eyes and hear without their ears will not only survive they will rebuild what is left when these end of days are over.
Be warned though! This time of the end of days has just begun and there are more trials and tribulations to come, so start preparing for it now, tomorrow will be much too late.

The last time you watched a spider drop from the ceiling on a line of silk, it likely descended gracefully on its dragline instead of spiraling uncontrollably, because spider silk has an unusual ability to resist twisting forces.
In a new paper appearing last week in Applied Physics Letters, from AIP Publishing, researchers from China and the U. K. showed that unlike human hair, metal wires or synthetic fibers, spider silk partially yields when twisted. This property quickly dissipates the energy that would otherwise send an excited spider spinning on the end of its silk.
“Spider silk is very different from other, more conventional materials,” said Dabiao Liu of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. “We find that
the dragline from the web hardly twists, so we want to know why.”
The golden silk orb weaver (Nephila pilipes) creates dragline silk that prevents it from spinning while hanging from its web.

A greater understanding of how spider silk resists spinning could lead to biomimetic fibers that mimic these properties for multiple potential uses such as in violin strings, helicopter rescue ladders and parachute cords. “If we understood how spider silk achieves this, then maybe we could incorporate the properties into our own synthetic ropes,” said David Dunstan of Queen Mary University of London.",1
"One could be forgiven for believing that, with all this talk of the coming “climate catastrophe,” Americans would be scrambling to flee Hurricane-prone states like Texas and Florida.The reality is just the opposite: Thanks totheir low cost of living,and minimal taxes, Florida and Texas are among the states in the US where populations are rising via interstate migration. Contrast that with Connecticut, which is far less vulnerable to hurricanes, and where the population drain has accelerated dramatically in recent years.
Both Harvey and Irma impacted some of the fastest-growing counties in the US, exposing a problem that’s probably frustrated city and county officials for years. How to upgrade decades-old sewage and water-treatment systems.
When the storms struck, the ancient systems quickly failed, releasing millions of gallons of raw sewage into city streets and canals, complicating the cleanup effort, according to Bloomberg:
“Millions of gallons of poorly treated wastewater and raw sewage flowed into the bays, canals and city streets of Florida from facilities serving some of the nation’s fastest-growing counties.In fact, 4 of the 10 fastest-growing coastal counties in the eastern U. S. are in Florida. More than 9 million gallons of releases tied to Irma have been reported as of late Tuesday as inundated plants were submerged, forced to bypass treatment or lost power.”
Of course, this problem requires a monumentally expensive fix:The Environmental Protection Agency estimated last year that $271 billion is needed to maintain and improve the nation’s wastewater pipes, treatment plants and associated infrastructure. In fact, many parts of Florida and Texas face infrastructure challenges even when they aren’t deluged by rain because of rapid population growth.
Otherwise, populations risk the spread of pathogens with every overflow.
Estimates for scale of the untreated and poorly treated wastewater that leaked because of both Irma and Harvey are expected to keep climbing.Even Hurricanes Hermine and Matthew, which were modest compared with this year’s storms,released some 250 million gallons of wastewaterthat hadn’t been fully treated between Aug. 31 and Oct. 15, 2016, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.
A treatment facility in Clearwater, Fla. Leaked 1.6 million gallons of wastewater into a creek, according to filings with the state’s Department of Environmental Protection.And that incident paled in comparison to a 30-million-gallon discharge of raw sewage after Hurricane Hermine caused pumps to fail, according to David Porter, the city’s public utilities director.
Electrical outages throughout the state caused lift station pumps to stop running in St. Petersburg and Orlando, prompting atleast 500,000 gallonsof spillage.A pipeline broke in Miramar, Florida, sending sewage spilling across a parkway – creating a nasty scene for the contractors who had to hunt for the rupture. And operators of a Miami-area wastewater treatment plant blamed a power outage for 6 million gallons of sewage released into Biscayne Bay.
Of course, this isn’t limited to a regional issue: Hurricane Sandy also unleashed a flood of sewage when it struck New York and New Jersey in 2012:
“After Hurricane Sandy ravaged the northeast US in 2012, damaged treatment plants and pumping stations caused untreated sewage to flow into local waterways for weeks.All told, facilities in the eight states hardest hit by the super storm released 11 billion gallons of untreated and partially treated sewage, according to one assessment.”
And asBloombergexplains, loose sewage poses lingering public-health and economic risks to a community…
“Sewage discharges carry both health and economic risks, as officials may order the closing of affected beaches and rivers for swimming and boating long after storm clouds have passed.When untreated water or raw sewage is spilled, it can deliver toxic chemicals from roads, E. coli from human waste and other pathogens that have the potential to cause viruses, parasitic infections, rashes and other health conditions.”
…Because the pollution can often be difficult to detect.
“We focus on the water and the flooding and the impacts to homes and everything else, which is super important,”said Danielle Droitsch, a program director with the Natural Resources Defense Council.“But understanding environmental contamination issues is more complicated. We don’t necessarily see the pollution, sometimes you can’t smell it and yet it’s there.”
And while there’s no such thing as a perfect sewer system…
“There’s no sewer system in the world that can be built that’s completely leak proof,”said Nathan Gardner-Andrews, chief advocacy officer for the National Association of Clean Water Agencies. Plants generally are designed to handle twice their normal capacity, but “when you get some of these rain events and you’re talking four to six to eight inches of rain in an hour, the engineering is such that you cannot build a system to hold that capacity.”
…Some sewage systems in rapidly growing southern counties, including the Florida counties affected by Irma, are more than 50 years old, and they demand immediate attention.
“Aging infrastructure may not be able to keep up with the demands of a surging southern population. In many cases, such as in south Florida, elements of the sewer system range from 60 to 70 years old, with pipelines that are even older, said Kelly Cox, a staff attorney and program director for the environmental group Miami Waterkeeper.”
“You throw a hurricane on top of that, and you are starting to see a lot more problems,” she said.

"Publicly traded companies have been hit with fewer and much less costly penalties by the Securities and Exchange Commission since Donald Trump became president.
From February through September, the agency, now headed by Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton, collected $127 million in corporate civil penalties in 15 cases, according to a POLITICO review of SEC data. That compares with $702 million in 43 cases from February through September 2016.
Notably, in December 2016 and the first 20 days of January 2017 — just before President Barack Obama’s SEC chief, Mary Jo White, stepped down — the agency collected $231 million in 23 corporate cases. The tally, compiled from cases posted on the SEC’s website, includes units of publicly traded companies.
It is still early in the tenure of Clayton, a Trump appointee who joined the agency in May. But these numbers suggest a course for enforcement at the regulator different from that of White, a former prosecutor, who emphasized corporate penalties as a way “to be certain our settlements have teeth.”
“I don't think they are inclined to impose large fines unless there is significant investor harm or benefit to the company,” Brad Bennett, a partner at law firm Baker Botts, said of the Clayton SEC.
“Your tally jibes with the anecdotal evidence in the defense bar suggesting that there was a burst of activity on older cases leading up to the inauguration and then a significant drop-off,” said Bennett, who was previously head of enforcement at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the market's self-regulator.
Clayton, who has questioned the fairness of penalizing entire corporations for what may be the infractions of a few individuals, has shifted away from White’s tough rhetoric and emphasized aggressive enforcement when retail investors are specifically harmed.
That was evident in an event he hosted this summer. The SEC chief organized a wine-and-cheese party for enforcement staff on his 10th-floor balcony overlooking downtown Washington. The small soiree was thrown to recognize the staff who brought charges on July 12 against a call center scheme selling dubious investments to senior citizens, said two people familiar with the event.
The message was clear: Clayton wants more enforcement cases where there is a direct link between misconduct and harm to smaller investors.
He drove home the point in September, when he announced a new SEC enforcement task force dedicated to fighting misconduct against retail investors.
Speaking at a conference on Thursday, Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC’s enforcement division, acknowledged that there is concern that the retail emphasis will detract from corporate prosecutions.
“I want to address one question that we have received a lot,"" Avakian said. ""That is, whether our enhanced retail focus means that we are allocating fewer resources to financial fraud and policing Wall Street. The answer to that question is simple: No. The premise that there is a trade-off between Wall Street and Main Street enforcement is a false one.”
Yet Avakian's co-director, Steven Peikin, said at the same conference that the SEC's enforcement division cannot hire new attorneys due to the lack of a budget increase for the agency. Trump asked to keep the agency's budget flat for fiscal 2018.
""We don't have hiring authority to backfill people who leave,"" Peikin said. ""I expect we will probably be down as much as maybe 100 spots by the time this budgetary constraint eases.""
SEC spokesman Kevin Callahan said it is too early to draw conclusions about the size and number of enforcement cases.
“The effectiveness and vigor of the SEC's enforcement program is best measured in its entirety over time,"" he said in a statement. ""Comparing arbitrarily selected data sets and dates is not illuminating or instructive.”
While the SEC’s new leadership has slapped penalties on individuals and private businesses such as accounting firms, fines for publicly traded companies are more controversial. Skeptics of corporate penalties argue that the fines are unfair to a firm’s shareholders, who end up paying even though they weren’t responsible for the wrongdoing.
Clayton has aligned himself with the skeptics.
“I do have a hard time making shareholders pay substantially for that type of activity,” he told the House Financial Services Committee at an Oct. 4 hearing, referring to wrongdoing that he said is often carried out by an ""individual bad actor."" That sentiment has been echoed by the SEC’s Republican commissioner, Michael Piwowar.
In a section on enforcement during a speech in July, Clayton talked about “affinity fraud” and “microcap fraud,” misconduct typically perpetrated by “The Wolf of Wall Street”-type characters — not big banks. He did not say anything about corporate penalties.
The SEC will publish a more comprehensive picture of its civil enforcement work in the days ahead when it releases statistics on cases and cash collected for the 2017 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. The agency typically doesn’t break out cash collected from corporate penalties as part of its overall tally for enforcement.
To be sure, corporate penalties are just one measure of SEC enforcement. The agency also orders wrongdoers to pay back ill-gotten gains in a practice known as disgorgement. Those are considered not penalties but remedies for victims.
And penalties can swing widely from month to month. In June 2016, Merrill Lynch, a Bank of America subsidiary, agreed to pay the SEC $358 million and admit that it used customers’ cash to trade with on its own. Had the firm lost money in its trading, customers would have been exposed to a massive shortfall in reserve accounts, the SEC said.
A month later, the SEC collected just $850,000 in corporate penalties.
Then, in September 2016, Weatherford International, one of the world’s biggest oil-and-gas servicing companies, paid the agency a $140 million penalty for alleged accounting fraud.
The biggest corporate penalty under Clayton was a $32.3 million fine in September on several units of State Street, a Boston-based financial services company. State Street overcharged customers, the SEC said.
Piwowar, who served as acting chairman before Clayton, dissented from 28 corporate penalties imposed in 2016 — including an $80 million penalty for Monsanto in February 2016 — and the first 20 days of January 2017. Typically, he dissented when the penalty was less than $1 million.
In a speech in February, Piwowar said he supports corporate penalties in certain circumstances, but added, “We must also remember the innocent investors who are so often the primary victims of the fraud.”
Piwowar has not dissented from any enforcement actions since White left.
Advocates for tough SEC enforcement point to history to argue that companies breathe easier when Republicans are in the White House.
SEC enforcement penalties plunged 84 percent — to $256 million from $1.59 billion — from fiscal year 2005 to 2008 during President George W. Bush’s administration, according to a 2009 Government Accountability Office report.
“Corporate penalties were highly disfavored and caused there to be fewer and smaller corporate penalties,” the report said.
One SEC attorney told the GAO that a company proposed a settlement with a higher penalty than what was ultimately approved by the agency’s commissioners. Another described having a proposed penalty range of $10 million to $35 million. But the commissioners reduced it to $5 million to $15 million.
As the SEC begins fiscal 2018, the cases the agency brings will tell a lot about whether Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other enforcement advocates are right to be suspicious of Clayton's enforcement strategy.
“In recent history, Republican commissioners on the SEC have favored weaker enforcement while Democratic commissioners have sought tougher enforcement,” Warren told him at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in March. “If President Trump wanted to make sure that the SEC would have a hard time in going after his Wall Street friends, it seems to me you would be the perfect SEC chair.""
Marcus Stanley, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, which frequently allies with Warren, said it's hard to judge Clayton's record because more time is needed.
“This data bounces around a lot, but the direction certainly looks more lenient,” he said.",0
"Year after year,Mexico places a multi-billion-dollar bet in a deal that big banks lust after. This is the untold story of how the “Hacienda hedge” happens.
Year after year,Mexico places a multi-billion-dollar bet in a deal that big banks lust after. This is the untold story of how the “Hacienda hedge” happens.
The men huddledin the same first-floor conference room as always, only this time they’d decided to make their annual oil bet bigger and bolder than ever before. Fewer than a dozen representatives from three Mexican government ministries and Petróleos Mexicanos, the state energy company, were about to make a wildly contrarian play. If it paid off, the profits would be enormous. And if they were wrong? They would have spent a small fortune in vain.
Almost seven months earlier, at the beginning of January 2008, the price of oil had flirted with $100 a barrel for the first time in history. It retreated to below $90 by the end of the month, but then, in early February, the price took off. West Texas Intermediate, the U. S. benchmark, reached a new high every month—$103.05, $111.80, $119.93, $135.09, $143.67—until finally, in early July, it hit $147.27 a barrel. Seemingly insatiable demand from emerging economies, including China and Brazil, encouraged outrageous chatter of $200 a barrel among the giddiest traders. Even those with bearish outlooks were fairly optimistic, figuring there would be a correction, not a crash.
Yet on July 22, 2008, just 11 days after oil reached its all-time high, this small group of Mexicans gathered to discuss their very different outlook in the ornate surroundings of Mexico’s finance ministry, the Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público. The palace—located on the Zócalo, the capital’s vast main square—had been built centuries earlier atop what once was the home of conquistador Hernán Cortés. On the walls around the main entrance, gigantic Diego Rivera murals depict the country’s history.
When “the men from Hacienda,” as they’re known, headed back to their desks, their mission was to lock in, or hedge, Mexico’s oil revenue through a deal with Wall Street banks. Within minutes they began firing off messages to the oil trading desks of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank. Their instructions were to buy “put” options, contracts giving them the right to sell oil at a predetermined future price, at levels ranging from $66.50 to $87 a barrel. The banks receiving the orders had never seen an oil deal this big. The price tag for the options was $1.5 billion.
From Houston to New York to London, bankers worked against the clock to close the gigantic transaction. It amounted to 330 million barrels, enough to meet the annual oil imports of the Netherlands. Barclays, which was then muscling into the commodity big leagues, did the bulk of the buying with 220 million barrels. Goldman followed, at 85 million barrels.
Betting that oil prices were about to crash was an audacious wager, one made all the more remarkable by the individuals behind the deal—civil servants with unassuming titles such as “director general of fiscal planning.” In the lucrative oil business, a profession known for its generous compensation, these government employees were probably the worst-paid stiffs around. Yet the men from Hacienda—so called still, even though women are sometimes in the room—proved prescient in predicting a crash.
Everybody knew the world was tipping into a financial crisis at the time, but because of its excellent banking and political connections in the U. S., Mexico may well have had special insight into just how bad things would get. What’s more, as one of the world’s top oil exporters, the country generally has better information than, say, hedge funds, about where the market is heading. In 2008, that information led those in the room to believe global supply was well in excess of global demand.
Sure enough, as the banks executed the deal over a five-month period, oil prices tipped into free fall amid the worst financial catastrophe since the Great Depression. In 2009 oil prices would average less than $55, well below the average price of the options of $70.
The key to success behind this huge sovereign oil hedge was moving “quickly, very quickly,” says Gerardo Rodriguez. Undersecretary of finance and public credit at the time, he was one of those in the room; he’s now a managing director at BlackRock Inc. “At the start of the summer we saw that the financial crisis was spreading fast,” he says. “Despite that, oil prices were still high. They were even climbing. We told ourselves, ‘We need insurance, and we need to take advantage of $150 oil prices.’ ”
In December 2009 the four investment banks involved in the deal wired the proceeds of the wager back to Mexico. Official records tracking the money that landed in Account No. 420127 at state-owned Nacional Financiera bank show the tidy sum Mexico made: $5,084,873,500.
Oil hedges aren’t uncommon.Airlines do them to insure against rising prices; U. S. shale producers rely on them to lock in revenue. But no deal comes close to matching Mexico’s annual “Hacienda hedge.” “Mexico is the biggest annual oil deal,” says Goran Trapp, founder of boutique advisory firm Energex Partners and former global head of oil trading at Morgan Stanley. Over the last 10 years, the notional value of the hedge has added up to $163 billion. “It’s the deal that all banks wait for each year,” says Richard Fullarton, founder of commodity fund Matilda Capital Management and a former senior trader at Royal Dutch Shell and Glencore. “It’s so large that it can make or break their year.”
Despite its size, impact, and huge fees, the deal is one that few people, even in the energy industry or on Wall Street, know much about. Painstakingly, the world’s 12th-largest oil producer and its bankers have cloaked the program in secrecy to prevent others—namely trading houses and hedge funds—from front-running Mexico’s orders. “Minimizing its visibility is extremely important,” wrote Javier Duclaud and Gerardo García, two senior officials at Mexico’s central bank, in a 2012 report for the International Monetary Fund.
This is the untold story of how Mexico, as early as 1990, constructed what quickly became the world’s largest and best-concealed oil trade.Bloomberg Marketsunraveled the secret history of the Hacienda hedge through dozens of interviews with current and former government officials, traders, brokers, bankers, and consultants, as well as a review of thousands of pages of previously unreported documents, some obtained through freedom-of-information requests in the U. S. and Mexico. Although some people agreed to speak on the record about the deal, others did so only on condition of anonymity because they were discussing a confidential government program.
Mexico’s oil hedge has real economic significance. Until fairly recently, the country relied on oil for about a third of its income, leaving it dangerously exposed to boom-and-bust price cycles. According to current and past government officials, the main purpose of the hedging is not to pad the country’s coffers but rather to protect the federal budget from fluctuations in oil prices.
What’s more, it’s a fiscally responsible exercise that reduces the country’s borrowing costs, says Fabián Valencia, a senior IMF economist in Washington who follows Mexico. “The hedge means Mexico pays about 30 basis points less on its sovereign debt,” he says. Hedging is like buying insurance, says Guillermo Ortiz, who was governor of the country’s central bank from 1998 to 2009: “You buy it hoping you won’t need it.”
For its part, Mexico has shown a Wall Street-style wizardry in trading oil. It usually makes money on its hedges—sometimes a lot of money, as in 2008-09. From 2001 to 2017, the country made a profit of $2.4 billion; its hedges raked in $14.1 billion in gains and paid out $11.7 billion in fees to banks and brokers. (The banks have an additional incentive: They can make money by creating trades of their own that are linked to but separate from the hedge itself.)
So far, Mexico has managed to dodge some obvious risks inherent in deals of this magnitude. “If you get it wrong,” says George Richardson, a senior official at the World Bank, speaking of megahedges in general, “it’s a serious political problem.” The fat fees going to the banks may also end up looking wasteful and may even dissuade other oil-producing countries from engaging in hedges of their own, he says. “Is it worth it to pay the premium rather than, say, build a new hospital?”
If anything, recent results have made the Mexican government look especially good. The country earned $6.4 billion in 2015 and $2.7 billion in 2016. For 2017, the jury is still out. Last summer, Mexico spent just above $1 billion buying put options with a floor price of $38 a barrel. If prices stay where they are now, hovering around $50 a barrel, the men from Hacienda won’t make any money, but if prices drop on average below $38 a barrel, they’ll start to. We won’t know the outcome until December.
Mexico first hedgedoil in 1990, after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and threw the petroleum-rich Middle East into crisis. Soon the United Nations had embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude, removing about 10 percent of the world’s supply from the market. Prices soared from a low of $15.06 a barrel in June of that year to $41.15 in October.
The Mexican treasury reaped the benefits of these fast-rising prices, but the government of Carlos Salinas de Gortari also sensed the boom wouldn’t last, not with the U. S. economy cooling and President George H.W. Bush preparing for war. According to Aldo Flores Quiroga, the country’s current deputy oil minister, the “thinking on the use of financial instruments of this kind has its origins in the 1980s, when Mexico was seeking to stabilize its fiscal stance.” In particular, the government had failed to anticipate the 1985-86 oil crisis, when Saudi Arabia flooded the market and prices tumbled. By 1990 the prospect that Washington could tap the brakes on oil prices by dipping into U.S. strategic petroleum reserves loomed large.
To make sure Mexico wasn’t again exposed to forces beyond its control, the Salinas government decided to bet on prices falling and enlisted Goldman Sachs. Stephen Semlitz, a rising star and head of energy trading at J. Aron & Co., the bank’s legendary in-house commodities unit, and Robert Rubin, Goldman’s co-chairman, who later became U. S. treasury secretary, proved instrumental in helping Mexico lock in a price of $17 a barrel for the first few months of 1991. The deal worked: Maya crude, Mexico’s benchmark, plunged as low as $9.75 a barrel that year. Despite the modest success of the Gulf War hedge, Mexico didn’t do it again for years, as oil prices remained relatively stable.
The country was again caught off guard in the late 1990s, however, when the Asian economic crisis crippled oil demand just as OPEC countries boosted production in a brutal attempt to gain market share. As a result, prices crashed. In December 1998, Mexico sold crude for as little as $5.68 a barrel to a U. S. refinery. Mexico, which isn’t a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, hadn’t anticipated the crisis and hadn’t hedged. In trader parlance, the country was naked.
The experience scarred a generation of government officials, who decided they could never leave themselves so exposed again. Thus began the modern Mexican hedge, which came into existence in the early 2000s after legislators passed a law allowing sufficient budgetary flexibility to accommodate the deals. In 2001, Mexico made a tentative showing, spending just $217.3 million on put options, a fraction of the approximately $1 billion a year it would spend later. In 2003 and 2004, with oil prices rising, the country opted not to hedge at all. (The Mexican government declined to comment for this story.)
The strategy came into its own in 2005, according to several officials familiar with the matter. Mexico has hedged every year since without interruption. Agustín Carstens, who later became head of the central bank, was finance minister when the big $5.1 billion payout came in 2009; some government officials also refer to the annual oil bet as “the Agustínian hedge.”
In the early 2000s,Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, already known as “the Wall Street refineries,” continued expanding into oil. The Hacienda hedge became an especially important part of their business, say bankers with knowledge of the deals. Goldman kept a particularly firm grip on the deal it had helped to fashion a decade earlier. As recently as 2010, according to Mexican government documents, Goldman was handling 56.5 percent of all the barrels involved in the deal.
Lured by the large fees and the cachet of landing part of such a prestigious deal, other banks—Barclays, Deutsche, JPMorgan Chase—began angling in. Mexico has since widened the net even further, recruiting outfits such as Citigroup, HSBC, and BNP Paribas, according to government documents. For the 2017 deal, the country reached outside the banking industry for the first time and hired the trading arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc.
In most recent annual hedges, Mexico has used from four to six counterparties. Current and former bankers involved in the deal say the lenders’ profits were $30 million to $80 million a year per bank. “The Mexican hedge is an extremely important part of the oil business of the banks,” says George Kuznetsov, head of research at Coalition Development Ltd., an analytics company that tracks investment houses. Nonetheless, while Mexico has spent an average of $1 billion a year hedging over the past decade, the banks’ slices of that rich pie have gotten smaller, as more and more lenders have entered the mix.
For some bankers, the deal’s overall profitability hides the danger of big one-time losses, according to people familiar with it. “Over the years, the hedge has built a mixed reputation with the banks,” Kuznetsov says. “There is a big potential you could lose.” Tellingly, some banks that were—or still are—active players in the oil market never touched the Mexico deal, including Société Générale, UBS, and Credit Suisse, according to government documents; Morgan Stanley decided on several occasions against participating. (All the banks featured in this story declined to comment.)
What’s more, U. S. regulations put into effect after the global financial crisis have introduced complications. Before 2008, banks kept the hedging risk in-house for weeks and even months, slowly offloading it to other clients without the need to go out into the broader oil futures market. For instance, a client other than the Mexican government—say, an airline seeking protection against rising prices—might take the other side of the Hacienda hedge.
After 2008, the rules of the game started to change. One example is the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making certain speculative investments. The rule went into effect in July 2015. Its constraints on risk oblige the banks to get it off their books quickly. One way banks do this is by hedging in the futures market: They might take the other side of the hedge themselves, in effect selling futures within a mix of oil and refined products.
The Mexican government was so worried about the Volcker Rule that it dispatched a team of officials to Washington in October 2012 to lobby the U. S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and other agencies. A Mexican presentation seen byBloomberg Marketsargued, in effect, that the banks needed to be able to hang onto risk for longer—that a transaction “of the size and characteristics of Mexico’s oil price hedging program requires swaps dealers to take significant commodity risk for extended periods of time in order to provide liquidity to markets.”
For the banks, the ability to hedge their bets is crucial. Given their exposure, if thehedge is poorly executed and the market moves against them, they risk losses that could eat into a large chunk of their annual profits.Take 2009: Mexico made $5.1 billion that year, but at height of the oil price crash, the mark-to-market value of the hedge (equivalent to what the banks could have ended up paying to the Mexican treasury) was huge—“close to $10 billion,” according to the report by Duclaud and García, the Mexican central bank economists. “The execution of the hedging program is challenging, so particular attention must be placed on selecting counterparties,” they wrote.
The 2009 payments highlight the size of the potential impact for the banks if their own hedges don't work well, not that that happens often, according to bankers. That year Barclays paid Mexico roughly $3.1 billion, equal to more than a third of its pre-tax adjusted profit; Goldman Sachs, $1.3 billion; Deutsche Bank, $405 million, and Morgan Stanley, $128 million.
Until 2009,the Mexican government didn’t disclose any information about the Hacienda hedge. Since then, its practice is to disclose as little as possible. And the banks? They never publicly acknowledge their participation in deals like this. Still, for all the Mexican government’s efforts to keep its megahedge hidden, a detailed history of how the deal works can be gleaned from the thick, bound volumes of the legislature’s annual audit, the Auditoría Superior de la Federación. Among other insights, the thousands of pages reveal that Mexico’s current practice is to buy so-called Asian-style put options. That allows the country to hedge an average price rather than the price at the expiration of the contract, as is the case with “American-style” options.
While the Mexican government hedges every year, it doesn’t enter the market at the same time. According to the audits, it has started buying options as early as May and as late as August. In the early years, Mexico locked in the price of West Texas Intermediate, but that caused trouble because of WTI’s ever-changing price relationship with Maya, Mexico’s main crude export grade. Today, to avoid price variations from benchmark to benchmark, the hedge involves a combination of Maya—usually 80 percent to 90 percent of the total—and Brent, the world standard.
The audits confirm Mexico’s reputation in the oil market for shrewd trading and its keen desire to keep the deal quiet. No year epitomizes those characteristics as much as 2007, the year before the big deal that made $5.1 billion for Mexico. The men from Hacienda started early in 2007, hedging 5 million barrels during the week of June 18. With prices failing to decline, Mexico slowly built up its position, selling 185 million barrels in the next three weeks. In late July, with prices rising fast, it went all in, doing 100 million barrels in a single week. The wave of selling sent prices tumbling 10 percent. Mexico immediately vanished from the market, staying quiet for three weeks. The men from Hacienda didn’t return until the end of August, as prices rose again, quickly selling an additional 85 million barrels in 10 days. In total that year, Mexico sold 435 million barrels in 68 deals. Goldman Sachs handled the bulk of those orders—250 million barrels in total.
The audits also disclose something oil traders have long suspected: Mexico doesn’t trade just in the summer; it’s been in the market during the winter at least once. In the summer of 2013, Mexico, as usual, bought put options, securing a price of $81 a barrel. But contrary to its usual practice, the country reentered the market in January and February 2014, restructuring the deal at $85 a barrel.
Mexican officials have argued that the hedge, which runs annually from Dec. 1 to Nov. 30, doesn’t affect prices. However, bankers who are or have been involved in the deal, as well as oil traders who monitor it closely, say Mexico’s hedging, in fact, roils the market. That certainly happens when Mexico’s bankers sell futures to protect themselves, putting downward pressure on oil prices. If only because of its magnitude, the hedge is a fount of rumor, chatter, and volatility—particularly when Mexico is hedging and the market is falling, as in 2008 and again in 2014.
Despite Mexico’s success,no other oil-producing country has followed suit with similarly large hedges. Several nations, including Qatar and Russia, have come close to implementing a big hedging program through Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, but they walked away at the last minute, according to people familiar with the talks.
For the massive Middle East producers, hedging appears to be a headache they’d just as soon avoid. With small populations and huge revenue, they instead self-insure, amassing their petrodollar reserves and saving during boom times by pouring money into their fat sovereign wealth funds. Saudi Arabia, for example, has since late 2014 used about $200 billion from its foreign exchange reserves to weather a period of low prices.
Poorer oil-producing countries don’t have that luxury, and that’s when oil hedging might look attractive. Ecuador, OPEC’s smallest member, is a case study in how an oil hedge gone wrong can cause a political storm. In early 1993, Quito decided to lock in oil prices through a series of relatively complex deals involving put options and swaps orchestrated in conjunction with Goldman’s J. Aron & Co.
Ecuador secured a floor of $14.88 a barrel for the year, handing the bank $12 million in fees. But the deal left the country exposed to pay more if prices turned out to be higher. To the surprise of the government, oil did indeed move in that direction, averaging $15.85 a barrel. As a result, Ecuador not only lost the $12 million it paid for put options that turned out to be worthless but also had to pay an extra $6 million to Goldman for the swap.
The political opposition to President Sixto Durán Ballén, according to an IMF review of the deal, blasted “the high losses to the country,” and Ecuadorean lawmakers appointed a special committee to investigate allegations of corruption against several officials involved in the hedge. (The panel concluded there was no wrongdoing.) Ecuador’s mistake may well have been to see the hedge as a bet rather than an insurance policy.
Mexico’s hedge has never triggered a political backlash of any real consequence. But that doesn’t mean the joyride can last forever. Oil is no longer the make-or-break revenue generator it once was. Last year it accounted for only 17 percent of total government revenue. And oil production is declining even as domestic demand is climbing—reducing net exports and hence the size of the deal.
In the hedge’s halcyon days, Mexico sold forward more than 450 million barrels of oil; this year it’s done only 250 million. Despite the budgetary stability the annual big bet has brought to this country of 122 million people, the sun may be setting, however slowly, on the hedge and the men from Hacienda who pull it off.

"Yes, that’s right. It’s time to choose sides. But before we do, we must do careful objective study so that we can definitely choose a winner for our collective affections.
So here’s what we do….
First, we watch and read all the USA and Israel news media, then we go to other side and check out the Palestinian and Iranian news on this issue. Then, we go to 3rd party sources e.g. Russia Today (RT) and learn more from a 3rd party.
Okay, so now that we have the full spectrum of information to make an informed pick on who we ought to side with.
Now, of course we all know that, in the USA, they government and media have already told us that Palestinians are terrorists and Israeli have an “unbreakable bond” with us. Today, Obama declared this bond again and that Israel has a right to defend itself. So they make it easy for us to choose. They are our leaders so why question them right?
Wow, that was easy! Go back to your job at the plant! Done!
But wait! As it turns out, surprise, we’re being lied to again! Who knew? I mean, after the bull shit they gave us with WMDs and linking Saddam with Al-Qaeda, I thought they would get off that lie train. But noooooooo! Here they are again playing games with truth to justify their agenda of profits, prophets, war, arms, and control of resources masking as some venture into democracy, freedom, liberty, and justice. Opps! We got duped again! Gosh, are we stupid or what?
Of course, on the other side, they are selling their stuff too….so let us not pass the morality compass to the other guys who throw bottle rockets. They too have an agenda.
Ok, so what do we really have?
Every leader is lying to us; selling us garbage, throwing bombs killing women and children, and telling us they have the right to do it because they are victims.
But as it turns out, the Jewish, Christian and Muslim peoples are much more similar in wants, needs, and ambitions. We all want peace, jobs, schools for our kids, and opportunities for jobs, and a chance to enjoy the boring machinations of life that make being alive super duper.
Worse for all of us, as it turns out, there are people making a ton of money off wars and killings. They have no interest in justice, liberty, freedom, democracy or the pursuit of happiness. They narrowly care about profits and power, that’s it and leave us, JA PEOPLE holding the bag. And it totally sucks!
So yes America, it’s time to choose who you side with….but be careful because buying the lies only makes harder on all of us. Instead, I strongly encourage us to side with JA PEOPLE. By JA PEOPLE, I mean all of us. That includes the Israeli boy in living in southern Israel who was hurt yesterday by an errant missile from Gaza. And that includes the Palestinian girl who was obliterated by a heat seeking U. S. made guided missile sent from a U.S Taxpayer funded F-15 plane.
What we should be siding with is all of us, not just some of us.
It’s time the USA mature and see the global world around us.
As for the faux leaders who sell the kill and maim actions to us, well, if they even injure, maim, or kill even one child on either side, we need to arrest them for crimes against humanity immediately. That goes for President Obama, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Gaza Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and all their assigns who take such action against us, JA PEOPLE!
The 20th century is gone now and we, JA PEOPLE, are here now. And there is no place for occupation, holocausts, genocides, and ethnic cleansing. It’s over and the only thing left now is jail for those who take that action.
So memo to all my fellow Americans, re-think who we should side with?
Should we side with JA PEOPLE and against all warmongers on all sides? Or should we continue to look the other way when Israel bombs and kills more and more Gazans in
the name of defense with our taxpayer dollars in our name?
I say reject the 20th century notions and grab on to all the people, JA PEOPLE!

"People often place actual, real, provable, and factual things that “sound” crazy into the “conspiracy theory” category. One of the most common things that are, in fact, very real, yet often dismissed as existing in the same realm as chemtrails and FEMA camps are underground bunkers for the rich.
We’ve all heard the stories: multi-millionaires and billionaires who have spent massive amounts of money to buy or build homes, towns, condos, even cities far beneath the Earth in case of some nuclear invasion, alien takeover, or whatever.
But… guess what? There are many millionaires who openly talk about their luxury underground mansions – and they have been doing so for years.
Back in 2012, The Huffington Post reported on the super-rich and their bunkers for “the apocalypse”:
Most people have too much on their plates to worry about what will happen when the world ends.
But then there are those who have too much money not to.
Four buyers have already spent about $7 million on luxurious doomsday-safe condos built in a Cold War-era missile shaft below a Kansas prairie,according to the AFP.
The cylindrical underground building not only includes condo space, but its developer is also adding an indoor farm, pool, movie theater, a stockpile of five years worth of dry food, and space for a medical center and school,the AFP reports.
Its inhabitants should be well protected. The condo building, which extends 174 feet underground,hosts concrete walls that are nine feet thick, according toThe Daily Mail. The shape of a silo,Forbes adds, also makes it an even more ideal hiding place.
The Wall Street Journal even listed a “For Sale” ad about this same bunker “condo building” in 2014:
Affluent buyers worried about doomsday are snapping up well-appointed bunkers built in a former missile silo.
When Tyler Allen agreed to fork over $3 million in cash for a luxury condominium near Concordia, Kan., he wasn’t attracted by the indoor swimming pool, 17-seat movie theater, or hydroponic vegetable garden.
The real selling point of the 1,820-square-foot apartment: It will be buried 174 feet underground in a decommissioned missile silo sturdy enough to withstand a nuclear attack.
Mr. Allen, a 45-year-old Orlando, Fla., sports bar and nightclub owner, insists he isn’t a “tinfoil hat-wearing” type preparing for the end of the world.
Rather, he cites growing security threats—such as a global health pandemic, cataclysmic weather and terror attacks.
“There’s a Camp David for the president,” he says. “If you’re at a certain level where you can afford it, you can get that, too.”
The so-called Survival Condo complex boasts full and half-floor units that cost $1.5 million to $3 million each. The building can accommodate up to 75 people, and buyers include doctors, scientists and entrepreneurs, says developer Larry Hall.",1
"The Pentagon warned Syria and Russia on Monday that the US is ready to shoot down their planes, which according to Washington are a threat to American advisers in northern Syria.
The warning followed after US fighter jets attempted to engage Syrian Arab Air Force planes in Syria last week, in a potential showdown that was avoided as the Syrian government planes left before the Americans arrived.
Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis claimed on Friday the US fighters attempted to intercept the Syrian planes to protect American advisers – a term the US military often uses for its Special Operations Forces – working with Kurdish forces after the Syrian government jets bombed the area.
On Monday, another Pentagon spokesman, Peter Cook, said, “We would continue to advise the Syrian regime to steer clear of those areas.”
“We are going to defend our people on the ground, and do what we need to defend them,” Cook told reporters.
“It’s not a no-fly zone,” he said, adding that “the Syrian regime would be wise to avoid areas where coalition forces have been operating.”
When asked about Russia, Cook said the US would also do the same with Russian jets, which have been striking Daesh targets in Syria at the country’s request since last year.
“If they threaten US forces, we always have the right to defend our forces,” Cook said.
Secretary of State John Kerry and Hillary Clinton have both said they support no-fly zones, but President Obama is reluctant to commit resources and troops to enforce such a measure
On Friday the Pentagon reported that two Syrian SU-24 attack planes attacked Kurdish forces undergoing training with US Special Operations troops around the northeastern city of Hasakah, but they had left by the time the American jets arrived.
The General Command of the Syrian Arab Army responded by saying thatKurdish forces were “attacking state institutions, stealing oil and cotton, obstructing exams, kidnapping unarmed civilians and spreading chaos and instability.”",1
"The US will give Israel $38 billion in military aid over the next ten years under a landmark agreement which was signed last Wednesday.
The deal, the biggest pledge of US military assistance to another country in history, was signed as planned by Israel’s national security advisor and a senior US diplomat.
The deal will require Israel to buy all weapons from US manufacturers, unlike previous aid packages which partially went to Israeli companies.
Ron Paul asks: Why Are We Sending $38 Billion to Rich and Powerful Israel?
Last week’s announcement of a record-breaking US aid package for Israel underscores how dangerously foolish and out-of-touch is our interventionist foreign policy. Over the next ten years, the US taxpayer will be forced to give Israel some $38 billion dollars in military aid. It is money we cannot afford going to a country that needs no assistance to maintain its status as the most powerful military in the Middle East.
All US foreign aid is immoral and counterproductive. As I have often said, it is money taken from poor people in the US and sent to rich people overseas. That is because US assistance money goes to foreign governments to hand out as they see fit. Often that assistance is stolen outright or it goes to the politically connected in the recipient country.
Just as bad is the fact that much of what we call “foreign aid” is actually welfare for the wealthy here at home. The aid package to Israel is a very good example. According to the agreement, this $38 billion will all go to US weapons manufacturers. So the real beneficiaries are not the American people, and not even Israeli citizens. The real beneficiaries are the US military-industrial complex. Perhaps the money won’t even leave Washington – it may simply go across town, from the Fed to the Beltway bomb-makers.
While even US government aid to desperately poor countries should be opposed on moral and practical grounds, it is even harder to understand US aid to relatively rich countries. At a nominal per capita GDP of over $35,000, Israel is richer than Japan, Italy, and South Korea. Not long ago Business Insider published a report by the Institute for the Study of War showing that the Israel is the most powerful military force in the Middle East.
We know they have hundreds of nuclear weapons, a sophisticated air force, drones, and even nuclear weapons-equipped submarines.
So why is the US giving a rich and incredibly well-armed country a record amount of military aid? Part of it is that the US government believes it can coerce Israel to do Washington’s bidding in the Middle East. History shows that this is a foolish pipe dream. If anything, US aid subsidizes Israeli human rights abuses in Gaza and elsewhere.
Another reason is a very powerful lobby in Washington, AIPAC, that pressures Members of Congress to focus on Israel’s interests instead of US interests. Members of Congress should look at our economy, with effectively zero interest rates, an anemic non-recovery from the 2008 crash, historically low participation in the work force, and inflation eroding the value of the dollar and conclude that this might not be the best time to start handing out billions of dollars in foreign aid. Unfortunately most Members of Congress find it impossible to say no to special interest groups like AIPAC.
Here’s a better aid package for Israel: free trade, travel, friendly relations, and no entangling alliances. Israel should be free to pursue its national interests and we should be free to pursue ours. If individual Americans feel compelled to provide assistance to Israel or any other country or cause overseas they should be allowed. But the rest of us should not be forced to do so. Trade, not aid.",1

"A startup backed by the Japanese automaker has developed a test model that engineers hope will eventually develop into a tiny car with a driver who'll be able to light the Olympic torch in the 2020 Tokyo games. For now, however, the project is a concoction of aluminum framing and eight propellers that barely gets off the ground and crashes after several seconds.
Toyota has invested 42.5 million yen ($386,000) in startup Cartivator Resource Management to work on ""Sky Drive."" At a test flight Saturday in the city where the automaker is based, the gadgetry, about the size of a car and loaded with batteries and sensors, blew up a lot of sand and made a lot of noise.
It managed to get up as high as eye level for several seconds before tilting and falling to the ground. Basketballs attached to its bottom served as cushions. After several attempts, the endeavor had to be canceled after one of the covers got detached from the frame and broke, damaging the propellers.
The goal of Cartivator's is to deliver a seamless transition from driving to flight, like the world of ""Back to the Future,"" said the project's leader Tsubasa Nakamura.
""I always loved planes and cars. And my longtime dream was to have a personal vehicle that can fly and go many places,"" he told The Associated Press.
The group is now working on a better design with the money from Toyota with the plan to have the first manned flight in 2019. No one has ridden on Sky Drive yet, or any drone, as that would be too dangerous.
Still, dabbling in businesses other than cars is Toyota's trademark. In recent years, it has been aggressively venturing into robotics and artificial intelligence, investing a billion dollars in a research and development company in Silicon Valley. It's also working in Japan on using robotics to help the sick walk. It also just announced a five-year $35 million investment in its research center in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for autonomous and connected vehicle technologies.
The idea that each generation must take up challenges is part of Toyota's roots, said auto analyst Takaki Nakanishi.
President Akio Toyoda's great-grandfather Sakichi Toyoda started out developing the loom and then its automated improvements from the 1890s, before the company became an automaker. More recently, Toyota sees software and services as central to the auto industry, as cars become connected, start driving themselves and turn into lifestyle digital tools, Nakanishi said.
As Toyota gets into the business of ecological vehicles, such as hybrids, electric cars and fuel cells, it's turning into an energy company as well.
""Toyota's business is centered on mobility, anything that moves, including people, things, money, information, energy,"" said Nakanishi.
Toyota is traveling not only in the skies but also to the waters, although that still remains a tiny part of its sprawling empire.
Toyota's boat operations began in 1997. Toyota now offers four models and has sold a cumulative 845 boats. In contrast, Toyota sells about 10 million vehicles a year around the world.
Reporters recently got a ride in Tokyo Bay of a Lexus luxury concept ""yacht,"" which runs on two gas engines. With a streamlined curvaceous design, inspired by a dolphin and evocative of a Lexus car, it's being promised as a commercial product in the next few years.
Designed for executives zipping through resort waters, it comes with fantasy-evoking features, like an anchor pulled in by a chain into a tiny door in the bow, which opens then closes mechanically.
The engine, shiny like a chrome sculpture, is visible beneath the sheer floor surface. Shigeki Tomoyama, the executive in charge, said the boat was going for ""a liberating effect."" A price was not given. Many Americans have already expressed interest, according to Toyota.
The project started about two years ago under direct orders from Toyoda, who has with Tomoyama spearheaded Toyota's Gazoo internet business, another non-auto business for Toyota.
""He asked us to create a space that can work as a secret hiding place in the middle of the ocean,"" Tomoyama said. ""We went for the wow factor, which requires no words.""",0
"Satellite pictures broadcast by China last week reveal three new advanced nuclear-propelled submarines that can fire cutting edge anti-ship missiles.
The Type-093G submarines are a second-generation nuclear-powered attack submarine, and are due to bedelivered to the Chinese army shortly.
Satellite pictures broadcast by China last week reveal three new advanced nuclear-propelled submarines that can fire cutting edge anti-ship missiles.
The Type-093G submarines are a second-generation nuclear-powered attack submarine, and are due to bedelivered to the Chinese army shortly.
The launchers are designed to fire YJ-18, the vertically launched version of China’s YJ-12 supersonic anti-ship missile, according to the Navy’s website. The advanced missile can reportedly carry a 300-kilogram warhead to a range over 200 kilometers and is capable of performing maneuvers at speeds of up to Mach 3 just before hitting its target.
The Type-093G submarine also has improved speed and mobility, and reduced noise compared to the regular version, the website said.
PLA’s Navy is believed to have up to six Type-093 submarines currently in service in addition to three older Type-091s. A new Type-095 submarine is currently in development. China also reportedly has four Type-094 ballistic missile submarines carrying JL-1 or JL-2 nuclear missiles.
Earlier in February, US Vice Admiral Joseph Mulloy said China had surpassed the US in the total number of submarines.
“They may not be the same quality, but their submarine forces are growing at a tremendous rate. They now have more diesel and nuclear attack submarines than we have,” the admiral told a House subcommittee.
“They are producing some fairly amazing submarines and they are actually deploying them,” he added, explaining the Chinese vessels are being sent on longer missions to regions located further from China.
The assessment sparked fears in the US that China would be able to strike American territory from its submarines deployed in the Pacific. However, the fears may be exaggerated, since JL-2, which according to some estimates has enough range to reach Alaska, Hawaii or the US military bases in Guam, is believed to have been in service since at least 2012.
Chinese naval development was addressed in the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s annual report to Congress in December last year, Military.com reported. Among other issues the commission commented on Chinese-Russian military development cooperation and a joint deal to build new attack submarines.
“China is pursuing joint-design and production of four to six Russian advanced diesel-electric attack submarines containing Russia’s latest submarine sonar, propulsion, and quieting technology,” the commission said.
“The deal would improve the PLA Navy’s capabilities and assist China’s development of quiet submarines, thus complicating future US efforts to track and counter the PLA submarines,” it added.",1
"Almost five years after the disaster, the Fukushima nuclear power plant is still experiencing major contamination issues.
A new declassified report from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, written on March 18, one week after the tsunami hit Fukushima , sheds light on just how bad it was.
It states that 100% of the total spent fuel was released to the atmosphere from unit 4.
RT reports: According to nuclear expert and whistleblower Arnie Gundersen in an interview with WBAI in New York, unit four contained more cesium “than in all 800 nuclear bombs exploded above ground”. Cesium has been linked to thyroid cancer, which is on the increase in the Fukushima area since the tsunami, according to the US National Library of Medicine. The chemical is highly soluble in water and can find its way into foodstuffs that have been prepared in contaminated areas.  Another report has also revealed this week that there are more than nine million bags of nuclear contaminated material piling up in Japan, according to the Fukushima Prefecture and the Environment Ministry. The declassified report from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the 2011 thyroid dose estimates ‘downstream’ from Japan in the US were within guidelines “except for Alaska”.
Engineers at Fukushima are still dealing with fallout from four years ago. Last week, the radioactivity at Reactor 1 was measured at 482,000 becquerels per liter of radioactive cesium, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said.
This is 4,000 times higher than last year and the company believes the contaminated water stored at a nearby building may have leaked into the duct, according to The Asahi Shimbun.
Increases in other areas have not been registered, the company said.
400 to 500 tons of radioactive seawater that washed ashore in the 2011 tsunami is pooled in the tunnels, which lie next to a temporary storage facility for radioactive water being used to cool nuclear fuel inside the damaged reactors.
TEPCO said they plan to investigate the spike in radiation.",1
"An online audit tool that sniffs out fake social media followers has published details that prove CNN paid for 17 million dubious Twitter followers.
According to Twitter Audit, a tool that uses an algorithm to separate genuine account from fake ones,over 52% of CNN’s total audience is comprised of bots.
Conservativetribune.com reports: “We use these scores to determine whether any given user is real or fake,” the site states.
“Of course, this scoring method is not perfect but it is a good way to tell if someone with lots of followers is likely to have increased their follower count by inorganic, fraudulent, or dishonest means.”
Which brings us to CNN.
Twitter Audit’s analysis showed that of CNN’s 36 million Twitter followers, 17,023,448 are fake.
Given all the recent news surrounding CNN and its failing journalistic integrity, it isn’t surprising to know that almost half of the network’s followers are not real.
To compare, 85 percent of YourNewsWire’sfollowers are real.
CNN is having a bad week, to put it lightly. The network was forced to retract a story that claimed one of President Donald Trump’s associates was under investigation for ties to a Russian investment bank. Three staffers were also forced to resign as a result of that error.
Just a few days later, ultra-leftist CNN host Van Jones was caught on tape saying that the whole Russia story is a “nothing burger.” To make matters worse, a CNN producer was also caught on tape saying that the Trump/Russia narrative is “mostly bulls***.”
CNN, once a bastion of cable news, is in deep trouble.
It’s good to know the network isn’t reaching nearly as many real people as its Twitter account suggests.",1
"Well this might seem a little hard to believe, but after reading this maybe you’ll get the point. If the cure for AIDS was released to the public, the US would be in great trouble making up for the gap that would appear in resources. Here are some numbers to consider:
In 2013, funding for the global HIV and AIDS response reached itshighest ever levelwith an estimated $19.1 billion made available for programs in low and middle-income countries.
Where is all of this money coming from?Domestic sourcesaccounted for the majority of global HIV funding (53 percent) – $9.9 billion. That is money coming from campaigns and donations which try to raise money for AIDS research.In 2012, international investment in HIV programs by donor governments was an estimated $8.9 billion. This is money coming in internationally to attempt to provide AIDS relief and continue the research for a cure.
What we need to know is that AIDS is a $20 billion dollar industry. And when a figure that big is involved, you can’t just allow the income to stop just like that.That $20 billion dollars is paying the salaries of tens of thousands of people who work for drug companies, who are researching, managing documentations, performing trials, handling finances, logistics, prevention, training, campaigning, etc.
In October of this year, theUniversity of Buffaloreceived a $3.85 million dollar grant for AIDS clinical trials. A 4 year $20 million dollar grant was given toHarvard Universitya few years ago from the CDC for clinical trials. Oregon State Universityreceived a $25 million dollar grant for AIDS research this year. TheUniversity of North Carolinareceived a $1.5 million dollar grant for AIDS research and training in September of this year. The list goes on and on.
So if a cure was found and released publicly, the US economy would be out 20 billion dollars, would be unable to pay people who are employed under jobs related to AIDS research because there would be no AIDS research to be done. Jobs would be lost, campaigns would end, grants would cease, and donations from the public would stop coming in. Not to mention, an estimated 2 million people die from AIDS each year, so population increases would be another issue they would have to deal with.
A patent has been held by the US patent office which claims to have found a means to kill the AIDS virus within humans by the use of a molecular scale tetrasilver tetroxide crystal. This patent is owned by Dr. Marvin S. Antelman.Here is a link to the patentthat was filed almost 2 decades ago.

"Edward Snowden has said that he is willing to go back to the US and face a trial if authorities can guarantee a fair and impartial trial.
Edward Snowden has said that he is willing to go back to the US and face a trial if authorities can guarantee a fair and impartial trial.
“Edward Snowden is ready to return to the US, but on the condition that he be given guarantees to receive a fair and impartial trial,” Kucherena told journalists on Tuesday, as cited by TASS.
The lawyer has said he received a letter from the US attorney-general promising no capital punishment for Snowden should he return to America.
So what we are being guaranteed is not the fair trial, but that Snowden will not be executed,” Kucherena said. “And it’s done by a prosecutor, who according to the law, is not in any way able to determine a court’s decision.”
Kucherena says he does not trust news of certain countries’ readiness to accept Snowden.
“I suspect that as soon as he leaves Russia, he’s going to be taken to a US embassy,” he said.
Edward Snowden, who holds a Russian residency permit, can in theory travel freely to other countries, but there are no guarantees of his security abroad, Kucherena specified. It is unclear how this would work in practice, though, because he has no passport for any country.
Snowden has a Russian and US team of lawyers, according to Kucherena, who said his client wants to go back home.
“He’s thinking about it. He has a desire to come back and we are doing everything possible to make that happen.”
In June 2013, Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified NSA documents to the media, revealing the organization’s widespread massive surveillance. Shortly after, the US Department of Justice charged the whistleblower with two counts of violating the Espionage Act as well as theft of government property. The State Department revoked his passport.
Snowden flew from Hong Kong to Moscow, where he intended to board a plane to Cuba. Because his passport had been annulled he wasn’t able to fly, and eventually he was granted political asylum in Russia, where he has been ever since.",1

In 2014, World Health Organization reported that around 200 million people are taking dangerous levels of arsenic through drinking water throughout the world and majority among them are lived in southern Asian states like Bangladesh, India, Cambodia, Vietnam and Nepal. But now a new study has lead by Kathy Gannon and Katy Daigle in which they concluded that the 60 million people are facing serious problem of arsenic contaminated ground water in Pakistan, another south Asian country, mainly in Indus River Valley.
A study published in a magazine entitled Science Advances reveals that water from 1200 ground water pumps has been tested located throughout the country which concludes that only two third of the samples can fulfil the safety level of arsenic (10 micrograms) recommended by WHO. Arsenic in water is never safe and the report has revealed that arsenic is found 200 micrograms per litre in Indus valley which is alarming as water is poisonous enough to cause death. And that Pakistan enjoys higher threshold of standard level and the case is still alarming. Scientifically, the team used statistical modelling method to fix the environmental factors that comprise arsenic concentration.
It is to be noted that arsenic naturally occurs in the crust of the Earth and has no taste and smell that is why it is difficult for lay people to determine whether water is affected or not and its long term use can lead to severe consequences such as cancer, cardiovascular  diseases, skin lesions and development defects.
There are many other factors that are causing more concentration of arsenic in water such as geological factors. According to experts, arsenic is more concentrated where PH of soil is relatively high and clay is relatively young that has effects of decades on water. To deal with the severe problem, the researchers suggest testing each and every source of ground water especially in Indus Valley which will inform the officials about the safe depth of ground water availability and then scientific treatments that can prevent arsenic from the water.

"While the Nationals continue their search for a manager and coaching staff, let’s turn our attention for a nanosecond to the people that group will oversee in 2018.
The Nationals don’t appear to have any significant holes to fill on their roster this offseason. Of course, they could always go out and make a splash, particularly in the starting rotation, which we touched on earlier this month. Washington has a history of doing — and trying to do — just that. But the necessary additions are relatively minor: They need to find a fifth starter, fill out the benchand add some pieces to the bullpen.
Second baseman Daniel Murphy’s status for the start of the season is unclear after he underwent knee surgery last week. But, besides that, the Nationals don’t face many questions. They havethe starting lineup, 80 percent of the starting rotation and the back end of the bullpen in place from a 97-win club. The core — and then some — is there. And that core isn’t cheap, which could have costly consequences.
As of now, Washington has $129,146,000 committed to 10 players next season. That group doesn’t include pre-arbitration players, arbitration-eligible players or players with options. It includes — in descending order of 2018salary — Max Scherzer, Bryce Harper, Stephen Strasburg, Murphy, Ryan Zimmerman, Gio Gonzalez, Ryan Madson, Adam Eaton, Shawn Kelley and Sean Doolittle.
[Joe Girardi to the Nationals? The question is no longer theoretical.]
Matt Wieters will almost definitely exercise his $10.5 million player option after toiling through the worst season of his career, which will bump the payroll to $139,646,000. Add Baseball-Reference.com’s estimates for pre-arbitration and arbitration-eligible players, and the tally climbs to $167,756,000.
Adam Lind’s $5 million mutual option isn’t nearly as certain. If the sides agree to exercise it, the Nationals’ payroll, including Wieters’s option, will stand at $172,756,000. If one or both don’t (the decision mustbe mutual), the Nationals will pay Lind a $500,000 buyout. If Washington goes that route, the payroll will be $168,126,000. Again, that’s assuming Wieters chooses not to test the free agent market. Lind’s camp and the team will agree on a date to decide by after the World Series.
So what do those numbers mean? Some context: The Nationals fielded their most expensive 25-man Opening Day roster last season at $164,335,444, according to Cot’s Baseball Contracts. That figure ranked in the top 10 in baseball and eclipsed the 2016 payroll by a little more than $2 million. The Nationals are on track to smash both marks. The 2018 club will most likely be the most expensive in franchise history.
Major League Baseball’s competitive balance tax threshold for 2018 will be $197 million — a $2 million hike from 2017. So one would think the Nationals, even if Wieters and Lind opt in, are comfortably below the penalty. But they’re not. That’s because the competitive balance tax is based on the average annual value (AAV) of a contract, not what the player is making that season. And that poses a significant difference for the deferred money-loving Nationals, who eclipsed the threshold in 2017 for the first time and paid a 20 percent tax on the overages for it.
For example, Scherzer is slated to make $22,142,857 next season. But his AAV is $28,689,376. That’s a difference of more than $6 million. The difference for Strasburg is nearly $7 million. The difference for Zimmerman is more than $2 million. Murphy’s salary offsets some of the discrepancies because his situation is inverted in 2018 – he’ll make $17.5 million but his AAV is just $12.5 million – but a gulf remains.
[Cubs bench coach Dave Martinez in D. C. to interview with Nationals]
According to Cot’s, the Nationals’ payroll is projected to climb over $193 million for competitive balance tax purposes with Wieters’s option, 40-man roster minor league players and estimated player benefits included. That leaves the Nationals, again according to Cot’s figures, only $3.7 million below the tax threshold.
The Nationals undoubtedly planned on having more room because they didn’t expect Wieters back on the books. But Wietersperformed below expectations, so they won’t have much room to work with — as presently constituted. And if they hit the mark again in 2018, they’ll have to pay a 30 percent tax as a repeat offender. If they stay below the threshold, the penalty level will be reset.
Perhaps the Nationals will, as a result, not add much salary this offseason. Maybe they’ll try to shed salary via trade. Or maybe they’ll proceed unconcerned about surpassing the threshold again, knowing 2018 may be their best chance to win a World Series with Harper, Murphy and General Manager Mike Rizzo in the final years of their contracts. But first they’ll need to hire a manager and coaching staff.

"Many people think the estate tax is for high rollers. An individual exemption of $5.5 million should be more than enough for anyone, they say. But things are a little different for farmers. We are land rich but cash poor.
According to the 2012 Census of Agriculture, 22% of the farms in Iowa were 500 acres or larger — more or less the size farmers will need to make a full-time living on their own property. At $8,100 an acre, that means $4 million in land plus several hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment, seed, fertilizer and other inventory just to make $75,000 a year or so.
And that’s in a good year: Right now, commodity prices are depressed, which means far less income to the farmer. Even an exemption of $11 million means owning land that can produce maybe $160,000 a year. That’s not a trivial income, but it’s hardly the sort of cash that demands a tax designed for the truly wealthy.
Many farmers play defense. They establish trusts, buy life insurance or make gifts to their families while they are still living, but this comes at a high cost. That money would be better pumped back into the farm. And that’s our biggest issue with the tax: endless expenses and legal maneuvering that accomplish nothing of value. All this happens so farmers don’t have to sell the farm piece by piece to pay the IRS.
The vast majority of farmers and ranchers come from multigenerational agriculture families for the simple reason that land and equipment is very expensive. Assets like those return much, much less than a similar portfolio of stocks and bonds would.
And land is not just low-performing as an investment, but difficult to sell, too. The estate tax means passing the family business on from one generation to the next remains a challenge for too many farmers.
The estate tax was meant for the truly rich, not people like us.

"This article was originally published after the Las Vegas shooting. It has been updated to reflect the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" — The Second Amendment
The battle over guns has proven to be one of the most dangerous inAmerica's culture wars — and with the murder of 26 people in a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, onSunday, the debate over how to regulate them continues.
The argument over gun controlisn't merely about safety. It's about identity. The gun has transcended its function asa weapon to become a powerful cultural marker. Itcan signal what kind of person you are, and often to which tribe you belong.
""It's not about the guns. The guns are a symbol,""said David Ropeik,author of How Risky Is It, Really? Why Our Fears Don’t Always Match the Facts.
Gun symbolism, social scientists say, was shapedby the nation's history. It has associations with the frontier and wars, with power and manhood. In modern political debates, it's associated with the idea of liberty from a""government [that] does too much to protect us and tramples on our personal rights,""Ropeik said.
When a gun carries that kind of cultural significance, it's ""a powerful image to fight against"" if you're a gun control advocate, said John Donohue, a Stanford University law professor andgun policy expert, ""and one that is largely immune from rational discussion.""
Gun culture isn't just about ""personal identity,"" said Adam Lankford, author of the2015 study“Mass Shooters, Firearms, and Social Strains: A Global Analysis of an Exceptionally American Problem."" The University of Alabama criminal justice professor said it'salso about ""shared identity — 'Do I fit in with my friends and family,according to the way we view the world and our values?'""
GUNS:Americans make up 4.4% of world population but own 42% of world civilian firearms
""For one side, guns represent aggression, violence, and a somewhat paranoid and anachronistic perspective that you have to protect yourself from external threats,"" Lankford said.""For the other side, guns represent safety, security, and self-sufficiency —and wrapped up in some of that is often a form of traditional masculinity whereby the man of the house must be able to physically protect his family.""
Justin Sollie, 27, is a libertarian-leaning Republican in Meridian, Miss. He grew up hunting, just like his father, and his grandfather before him.Sollie, a high school math teacher,owns guns for hunting and personal protection, but says he supports tighter restrictions on guns, including a ban on high capacity semi-automatic weapons. Sollie knowsmany people in his community would not.
""It's the idea of guns and gun culture that matters more than the gun itself,"" he said. To many Southerners,guns are ""freedom.""
People ""cling"" to their weapons because of ""ingrained distrust of thegovernment,"" Sollie said.Gun control advocates, he said, aren't fighting something tangible — they're fighting ideology.
The debate is notably partisan — oras Ropeik calls it, ""tribal.""
National polls show a clear split.According to a 2017 surveyfrom thePew Research Center, 91% of Republican and Republican-leaning gun owners say owning a gun is essential to their freedom vs. 43% of Democrats/Democrat-leaning gun owners.And even Republican non-owners are more likely than Democratic owners to view it as an essential right (61% vs.43%).
We are social animals and pressure to be loyal to party or tribe is strong, experts say.
""We aren't 325 million individuals who make up our individual opinions based on the facts,"" Lankford said.
Frustrated by lack of action after a student killed nine people at an Oregon college in 2015, President Obama saidgun violence is “something we should politicize.""
On the other side, gun rights groups gave $5.8 million to members of Congress in 2016, 98% of which went to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Thenon-partisan group that tracks campaign spending also reported thatin just the 2016 presidential race, the National Rifle Association spent $10.6 millionto support Donald Trump and $19.7 million to oppose Hillary Clinton.
The NRA puts outmessaging about an intrusive government that wants to ""take your guns,"" while its ""pro-gun"" lobbyingopposes gun control measures. It has been successful.
The NRA has not responded to repeated requests for comment. However, it has historically accused opponents ofexploiting mass shootings to push for restrictions they say demonize law-abiding gun owners.
It seems as thoughthe divide is impossibly stark, but experts say Americans share more in common than their Facebook feeds would suggest.
Large majoritiesin both partiessupport preventing the mentally ill and people on no-fly lists from buying guns, as well asbackground checks, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March and April of 2017.
""Everyone for the most part is for safety and against senseless terror and death,"" said Jonathan Metzl, director of the Center for Medicine, Health, and Society at Vanderbilt University. ""There's a sense of commonality. I think the problem is that it's very hard to find rhetoric that's not polarizing, considering that this debate is so beholden to so many different interests on all sides.""
The desire for safety is basic and universal. The disagreement is over whether guns actually make one safer.
Three in ten American adults say they own a gun and 67% say protection is a major reason, Pew reports, despite a 2016 reviewin the journalEpidemiologic Reviews of 130 studies that found firearm restrictions are associated with fewer deaths.
Investigation: Gun accidents kill at least 1 kid every other day
It'swhy gun sales spike after mass shootings, and why even people who know the data on gun safety find themselves internally debating whether they should own a gun.
After the Sandy Hook shooting, Lankford, the criminal justice professor whose 2015 study found thenation's gun ownership rate to be the strongest predictor of its number of public mass shooters,said he was asked if he would feel safer if professors on campus were armed.
""My answer was, 'I would feel safer if I had a gun, but I wouldn't feel safer if all professors were armed.' Itreally is a double standard. I trust myself, but I don't trust others,"" he said.
Lawrence Rutt, 48, an Army Special Forces veteranin Austin,Texas, didn't have a gun at home until this year, after he witnessed a drug bust while traveling for work. He said the incident rattled him, and he bought a9mm handgun.
Rutt, a Democrat,says he supports stricter gun control measures and wondersaloud what it will taketo change public policy.
""It's just a sad, sad moment when reporters ask the press secretary, 'when are we going to evaluate gun laws, and she said 'it's not the time.'Why is it not time to address gun laws right after a massacre in LasVegas?"" Rutt asked. ""This was over 600 rounds. That is crazy. Holy mackerel, that's a lot of rounds.""
Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddockhad an arsenal of 23 weapons in his hotel suite, including semiautomatic rifles.He possessed a little-known device called a “bump stock,"" which allows a semi-automatic rifle to mimic a fully automatic weapon by unleashing an entire large magazine in seconds.
A month later: Bupkis done on bump stocks
As the nation grapples with yet another macabre tragedy, many Americans are bewildered, fighting resignation in the face of a kind of violence that has begun to feel inevitable.
""The gun control argument is about fears,"" Ropeik said. ""Some people are afraid of themselves or others being shot. Some people are afraid of losing control over their lives in a deeper, broader more comprehensive sense. That fear is deeper, and that fear is winning.Unless we validate that fear and respect it, it'll stay a battle with no solution.""",0

"And now I’ve heard it all. A “Religion of Peace” follower and his covered from head to toe wife are trying to shake down an American pizza company for 100 million dollars in the new Islamic city of Detroit Michigan. Because of all things, they served his Muslim behind a pork pepperoni pizza instead of halal beef pepperoni pizza.
What possible sin could this Pizza Restaurant have done to merit the wrath of this peacefulMuslim? They served his Muslim behind a pork pepperoni pizza instead of halal beef pepperoni pizza.
The upset Muslim, in this case, hit Little Caesar’s Pizza with a 100 million dollar lawsuit for trying to pass off pork as halal meat. The “Peaceful Muslim” stated Little Caesar’s Pizza cannot get away with such an act. He pointed out the “Halal Pepperoni” fluorescent sign hanging from the store’s window.
He went on to state that the sign leads diners to believe that their halal pizzas contain no pork.
Little Ceasar’s released a statement, “Little Caesars cherishes our customers from all religions and cultures, and the communities we serve are very important to us. While we can’t comment on pending litigation, we take this claim very seriously.At this time, we believe it is without merit.”So Little Caesars basically called this Muslim scumbag what he is, a liar. But that’s ok because Islam does let you lie to “Infidels” such as Little Caesar’s Pizza.
But interestinglyenough, the more we learn about the case the more it looks likeLittle Ceasar’s assessment is correct. Apparently, the Muslim man went into the store toorder a pizza expecting that the person who took his order would know he wanted a “halal” version. I bet if the employee would have given him a halal pizza without him asking he would be suing for stereotyping him as a Muslim.
He honestly couldn’t tell thedifference? Beef curls up and is darker in color after cooked.
Experiments for measuring the heart frequency and brain activity during slaughter conditions were carried out on 23 sheep and 15 calves. After implanting permanent electrodes into the Os frontale the cerebral cortex impulses were measured for 17 sheep and 10 calves during ritual slaughter and for 6 sheep and 5 calves during captive bolt application with subsequent bloodletting. Some sheep were additionally subjected to thermal pain stimuli after the ritual cut.
The investigations had the following results:
1. After the bloodletting cut the EEG initially is the same as the EEG before the cut. There is a high probability that the loss of reaction took place within 4 – 6 seconds for sheep and within 10 seconds for calves.
2. The zero line in the EEG was recorded no later than after 13 seconds for 17 sheep and no later than 23 seconds for 7 calves.
3. Thermal pain stimuli did not cause an increase in activity.
4. After the cut the heart frequency rose for calves within 40 seconds to 240 heart actions per minute and for sheep within 40 seconds to 280 heart actions per minute.
1. After captive bolt stunning all animals displayed most severe general disturbances (waves of 1-2 Hz) in the EEG, which almost with certainty eliminates a sense of pain.
2. The zero line in the EEG was reached for 4 calves after 28 seconds.
3. For two sheep the cerebral cortex activity only stopped in one half of the brain, whilst it continued in the other in the –region (up to 3.5 Hz) until the bloodletting cut.
4. The bloodletting cut resulted for all animals in a brain activity (e and d waves).
5. Thermal pain stimuli caused an increase in activity in one sheep.
6. The heart frequency rose directly after stunning to values above 300 actions per minute.
In summary the following conclusions are possible:
After captive bolt stunning most severe general disturbances (waves of 1-2 Hz) occurred in the EEG, which almost with certainty eliminates a sense of pain.
Similar disturbances were also seen in sheep, but besides the somewhat higher frequency there are still clearly superimposed waves. For one animal waves could be recorded after pain stimuli until after the 200th second. Apparent cramps were registered for all sheep with the exception of one animal.
2. Slaughter in the form of ritual cut
After the bloodletting cut loss of reaction (loss of consciousness) occurred with high probability within 10 seconds. A clear reaction to the cut could not be detected in any animal. For 7 animals a zero EEG was recorded no later than after 23 seconds. Cramps occurred in the animals regularly only after the brain currents had stopped.
After the bloodletting cut loss of reaction (loss of consciousness) occurred after 10 seconds the latest. A clear reaction to the cut could not be detected in any animal. The zero line was recorded no later than 14 seconds after the cut. Cramps only occurred after the zero line had been detected and were much shorter than after captive bolt stunning.
The slaughter in the form of ritual cut is, if carried out properly, painless in sheep and calves according to the EEG recordings and the missing defensive actions.
During the experiments with captive bolt stunning no indications could be found for proscribing this method for calves.
For sheep, however, there were in parts severe reactions both to the bloodletting cut and the pain stimuli. A proof of the reliable effectiveness of captive bolt stunning could not be provided using the methods applied.
These first experiments carried out under clinical conditions, and the insights for the correlations of sensory physiology during stunning/slaughter of small ruminants, initially lead to the following factual and legal considerations for the preparation of legislation:
These experiments on sheep and calves carried out within a clinic show that, during a ritual slaughter, carried out according to the state of the art, using hydraulically operated tilting equipment and a ritual cut, pain and suffering to the extent as has since long been generally associated in public with this kind of slaughter cannot be registered; the ritual slaughter carried out under these experimental conditions complies with the requirements of article 4 para. 1 TierSchG. The EEG zero line – as a certain sign of the expiration of cerebral cortex activity and according to today’s state of knowledge also of consciousness – occurred generally within considerably less time than during the slaughter method after captive bolt stunning.
Nobody can dispute that any slaughter of animals is an aesthetically loaded process. Thus the wide-spread emotional resistance to kill an animal, which has not been stunned, by cutting the throat, is understandable. Certainly the psychological argument for stunning the animal to be slaughtered must be considered to some degree for the person carrying out the slaughter or consuming the meat of these animals. Whether these initial findings of objective data on the processes of “consciousness/pain” made possible by the research brief are sufficient to somewhat alter existing opinions in the sense of the scientific orientation of animal welfare as demanded by the TierSchG, remains to be seen. They need to be followed as a high priority by further investigations in the continuation of the scientific clarification of the issues of loss of pain and consciousness during slaughter of this kind with and without stunning using the same experimental approach with a representative number of grown cows of various breeds. A new research brief is already due to be issued to a different scientific institute.
Why are we even catering to these people? Halal meats should be illegal in this country, Period. They cause undue suffering to the animal and that’s downright barbaric. Like most everything “Peace Loving Muslims” do.

"Israel bombed the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) inside the Golan Heights on Thursday evening in an attempt to protect their Al-Qaeda ‘allies’.
The Israeli Air Force claim the bombing raids were a response to the shelling of occupied areas by the SAA.
According to the Syrian Army’s 90th Brigade, an Israeli warplane bombed the SAA’s positions at the town of Qaws Al-Sandiyanah, which is located 1km south of Harfah. As a result of the strikes, the Syrian Army’s 130mm field artillery gun was destroyed.
The airstrike comes just hours after the Syrian Army had advanced against Al-Qeda in theBeit Jinn pocket of the Golan Heights.
Haaretz.com reports: Iran’s military chief Mohammad Baqeri on Wednesdaypledged to fight Israel and Sunni insurgents during a visit to Damascus, and discussed ways to deepen cooperation with the Syrian military. “It is not acceptable for the Zionist regime to violate Syria anytime it wants,” Baqeri said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the strike that Israel will not tolerate spillover from Syria.“We have a clear policy,” the prime minister said during a speech at a ceremony marking 50 years of Israeli settlement in the Jordan Valley. “We will attack anyone who attacks us. We won’t accept spillover. If they attack us, we return fire. And it doesn’t take much time.”
Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that “any violation of the sovereignty of the State of Israel will be met with a determined response, just as the IDF acted a short while ago.” Lieberman, who is currently visiting in Washington, D. C., added that Israel views the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad as “responsible for everything that is happening in its territory,” and suggested “not to test our patience and red lines.”
This is the second time Israel has stuck Syria this week. Baqeri’s comments came following an Israeli strike on Monday, in which the air force attacked an anti-aircraft battery east of Damascus after it fired a missile targeting Israel Air Force planes.
The Syrian military warned of “dangerous consequences” following the rare strike, and claimed that they had successfuly hit an Israeli jet.
“The Israel Defense Forces will not tolerate any attempt to harm the sovereignty of Israel and the safety of its citizens and views the Syrian regime as responsible for what transpires in its territory,” the Israeli army said.",1

Direct Confrontation Growing More Likely between Syrian Army, US-Backed SDF in Deir Ezzur
Field sources confirmed on Monday that the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have sent a large number of fighters to Southeastern Deir Ezzur, intensifying the possibility of direct confrontation with the Syrian Army troops deployed in the region.
The sources said that the US-backed SDF seized the villages of Shudayha, Younes, Shaitat and Sarhit oilfields from the ISIL in Eastern Deir Ezzur on Sunday.
They added that the oilfields were simply handed over to the Kurds by ISIL members.
The sources said that the SDF has dispatched a large number of fighters to Southeastern Deir Ezzur to kick off an imminent operation.
The latest advances have put the SDF within 40 kilometers of distance from the town of Albu Kamal, the last major ISIL stronghold in Syria as well as within a striking distance from the Euphrates River through a new flank.
The Syrian army men have also deployed only 30 km away from Albu Kamal.
The Russian Defense Ministry said in statement on Sunday that the country’s Air Force carried out a number of combat flights over ISIL’s defense lines in Southeastern Deir Ezzur amid rapid advances of the Syrian Army troops toward the terrorist-held town of Albu Kamal at the border with Iraq.
The ministry’s statement said that Russian Tu-22M3 bombers that took off from Russian territory and reached Syria via Iran and Iraq conducted airstrikes against ISIL targets, focusing mostly on arms, munitions depots and command posts.
The statement said that “provided data confirm destruction of all assigned objects.”
The Russian military has been conducting an air operation in the Albu Kamal area over the last several days.
Also, Russian Defense Ministry’s Spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov announced that almost two dozen anti-ISIL strikes by the Russian military paved the way for the Syrian army to succeed in Southeastern Deir Ezzur in recent days.
The Russian army aircraft has been carrying out combat sorties over ISIL’s stronghold in Albu Kamal region.
Also, the Russian submarines fired several cruise missiles at ISIL’s positions in Deir Ezzur from Mediterranean Sea.

"President Obama’s anticipated executive action on immigration is long overdue, but still might not include important provisions for Asian Americans, said Bill Ong Hing, founder of the Immigration Legal Resource Center and University of San Francisco law professor.
Missing from the list of policy details so far has been any positive mention of the petitioning of older siblings, the historical way Asian families have reunited in America. “We’re disappointed that wasn’t on the list,” Hing said in an interview with NBC News. “He could have taken action on that. We’re still going to fight for that.”
It's estimated that of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, 1.4 million are either Asian or from the Pacific Islands.
Hing praised any executive action that could provide deportation relief for up to five million people by expanding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) and making it possible for those not here legally to apply for temporary work permits.
“There are people here who are helping society, helping the economy, have strong family ties, and make contributions to this county,” said Hing. “In my opinion, they’ve earned the right to be here.”
Hing, who recently met with top Obama advisors on the plan -- including Cecilia Munoz, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, and Esther Olavarria, Senior Advisor at the Department of Homeland Security -- warns any action would be temporary, and could be reversed by future administrations.
Some Republicans have already threatened counter action. This week, Democrats closed ranks with a letter of support for immigration reform. Hing hopes Congressional leaders will find a way to come together.
“If Republicans want any chance at winning the White House,"" said Hing, ""they can’t afford to alienate the groups that support immigration reform.”
The full details of the plan are expected to be announced by the president this week.",0
"The US military has unveiled a $65 million dollar project to develop a ‘brain chip’ that would allow humans to plug directly into computers.
According to DARPA officials, the new matrix-style technology could allow for the creation of ‘super soldiers’ and allow doctors to help blind people see again and paralysed people walk.
Daily Mail reports: It has selected its five grant recipients for the Neural Engineering System Design (NESD) program, which it began at the start of this year.
Brown University, Columbia University, The Seeing and Hearing Foundation, the John B. Pierce Laboratory, Paradromics Inc and the University of California, Berkeley will all receive multi-million dollar grants.
‘These organizations have formed teams to develop the fundamental research and component technologies required to pursue the NESD vision of a high-resolution neural interface and integrate them to create and demonstrate working systems able to support potential future therapies for sensory restoration,’ official said.
Four of the teams will focus on vision and two will focus on aspects of hearing and speech.
The work has the potential to significantly advance scientists’ understanding of the neural underpinnings of vision, hearing, and speech and could eventually lead to new treatments for people living with sensory deficits.
‘The NESD program looks ahead to a future in which advanced neural devices offer improved fidelity, resolution, and precision sensory interface for therapeutic applications,’ said Phillip Alvelda, the founding NESD Program Manager.
‘By increasing the capacity of advanced neural interfaces to engage more than one million neurons in parallel, NESD aims to enable rich two-way communication with the brain at a scale that will help deepen our understanding of that organ’s underlying biology, complexity, and function.
‘A million neurons represents a miniscule percentage of the 86 billion neurons in the human brain.
‘Its deeper complexities are going to remain a mystery for some time to come. But if we’re successful in delivering rich sensory signals directly to the brain, NESD will lay a broad foundation for new neurological therapies. ‘
The program’s first year will focus on making fundamental breakthroughs in hardware, software, and neuroscience, and testing those advances in animals and cultured cells.
Phase II of the program calls for ongoing basic studies, along with progress in miniaturization and integration, with attention to possible pathways to regulatory approval for human safety testing of newly developed devices.
As part of that effort, researchers will cooperate with the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin exploration of issues such as long-term safety, privacy, information security, compatibility with other devices, and the numerous other aspects regulators consider as they evaluate potential applications of new technologies.
‘The goal is to achieve this communications link in a biocompatible device no larger than one cubic centimeter in size, roughly the volume of two nickels stacked back to back,’ DARPA has said previously.
The program, Neural Engineering System Design (NESD), stands to dramatically enhance research capabilities in neurotechnology and provide a foundation for new therapies.
‘Today’s best brain-computer interface systems are like two supercomputers trying to talk to each other using an old 300-baud modem,’ said Phillip Alvelda, the NESD program manager.
‘Imagine what will become possible when we upgrade our tools to really open the channel between the human brain and modern electronics.’
Among the program’s potential applications are devices that could compensate for deficits in sight or hearing by feeding digital auditory or visual information into the brain at a resolution and experiential quality far higher than is possible with current technology.
Neural interfaces currently approved for human use squeeze a tremendous amount of information through just 100 channels, with each channel aggregating signals from tens of thousands of neurons at a time.
The result is noisy and imprecise.
In contrast, the NESD program aims to develop systems that can communicate clearly and individually with any of up to one million neurons in a given region of the brain.",1
"At least 10 people have died and at least hundreds of people have been left homeless as Hurricane Irma slams through the Caribbean and heads toward the continental U. S.
The category 5 storm – the most potent Atlantic Ocean hurricane ever – has severely damaged many small islands in the Caribbean, ripping apart buildings and causing heavy flooding.
Also in the path of Hurricane Irma’s wrath: celebrities’ multi-million dollar homes. Read on for a look at some who have homes in areas expected to be hit hard by the storm.
President Donald Trump’s multi-million dollar mansion in the Caribbean island of St. Martin is for sale – and it’s directly in the path of Irma.
The 11-bedroom mansion was listed for $28 million, but the price was lowered to $16.9 million in August.
The ocean-front property includes a heated pool, tennis court, outdoor bar and a fitness center, according to its listing. It’s named le Chteau des Palmiers, Castle of the Palms.
Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and Trump National Doral golf course in South Florida are also threatened by the hurricane should it continue on its path and ravage Florida.
Billionaire businessman Richard Branson didn’t flee from Hurricane Irma; instead, he hunkered down in a wine cellar on his private island and waited it out.
Branson’s company, Virgin, said all of the Necker Island staff was accounted for after the storm hit Branson’s Caribbean island. The island “sustained extensive damage,” the statement said, although the full extent is not yet known.
“We will do whatever we can to support and assist our local community through this extremely testing time,” the statement said.
Sam Branson, the businessman’s son, shared horrific photos and videos on Instagram of the storm and its damage.
“Nobody has no place to live, everybody is homeless,” a distressed woman is heard saying in a video Sam Branson posted. “I’ve got goosebumps all over my body right now.”
""I have never seen anything like this hurricane. Necker and the whole area have been completely and utterly devastated,"" Branson said in a blog post Thursday. ""We are still assessing the damage, but whole houses and trees have disappeared.""
Actor Johnny Depp owns a private island in the Bahamas, which is in the projected path of Hurricane Irma.
Called Little Hall’s Pond Clay, Depp has named some of the island’s beaches after his children and mentors, according to a 2009 Vanity Fair profile.
Depp paid $3.6 million for the island in 2004, according to Forbes.
Actor Bruce Willis’ mansion in the Turks and Caicos is within the storm’s path.
Willis’ home, called The Residence, can be rented out by those seeking to get away – and who have $20,873 per night, according to Travel + Leisure. The ocean-front home in the exclusive Parrot Cay resort has a five-bedroom main house and two three-bedroom guest villas, according to Travel + Leisure.
Willis married model Emma Heming at the home. She has been posting messages of support to friends in the Turks and Caicos on social media.
Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards also owns a mansion in the Turks and Caicos’ Parrot Cay resort.
And like Willis, Richards’ home is available for rent for about $8,107 per night, according to Travel + Leisure.
The three bedroom home sits on the ocean and has a heated swimming pool and garden tiki hut.
Actor and comedian Eddie Murphy owns a private island in the Bahamas called Rooster Cay.
Murphy reportedly paid $15 million for the island in 2007, according to Forbes.
Musha Cay is a private island situated in the Bahamas and owned by magician David Copperfield.
Copperfield bought the 100-acre island for $50 million in 2006, according to Forbes. And after he acquired a few additional islands nearby, he developed Musha Cay and the Islands of Copperfield Bay into a luxury resort.
The resort has five guest houses with private beaches and a chef. The site, which can host 24 people at a time, can be rented forabout $57,000 a night.
“When I acquired these islands, I made a personal commitment to transform this already perfect place into the most magical vacation destination in the world,” Copperfield said on the private island resort’s website. “Everything truly magical that I’ve ever experienced, everything that has created wonder for me, we’re recreating here at Musha Cay and the Islands of Copperfield Bay.”
Along with billionaire James Packer, actor Robert De Niro has been developing a luxury resort on the Caribbean island of Barbuda, the Paradise Found Nobu Resort.
“We are beyond saddened to learn of the devastation in Barbuda caused from Hurricane Irma,” de Niro said in a statement to Extra, promising to “rebuild what nature has taken away from us.”",0
"In 2014, Food Stamp benefits were given by around 46.5 million Americans, each of them receiving an average of $125.35 per month. This is meant to help people in need, but there have been noticed many cases in which recipients were trading in their cards for cash.
The government has taken actions against this kind of fraud, by passing a rule that requires SNAP recipients to contact the state when there have been an excessive amount of requests for EBT card replacements in a year, which would mean that there has been an exchange SNAP cards for money or other payment methods.
Unfortunately, this wasn’t enough to fix all the problems with the already abused system, causing millions of dollars worth of damage.
It has been recently reported that fourteen people were arrested for committing a $16 million worth food stamp fraud.“More than a dozen retail store operators in and around Baltimore have been charged in connection to a huge food stamp and wire fraud scheme.
The indictments allege the retailers received more than $16 million in federal payments for transactions in which they did not provide any food, a fraud scheme commonly known as “food stamp trafficking.”
As a result these transactions, they allegedly obtained more than $16,482,270 in EBT deposits for transactions in which food sales never occurred or were substantially inflated and split the proceeds with food stamp recipients”.

There is a quite noticeable pattern. Ten of the fourteen arrested are Muslim, which cannot be a coincidence. So, yes, they stole the money, but it poses the question – where did those millions go? Perhaps in some terrorist organization?
The trend of exchanging the benefits for cash must be stopped immediately. This creates no-strings-attached money which is worth less – food stamp benefits are sold for between 50-70 cents on the dollar.
So, to prevent this and to disable Muslims from taking our tax money and spend it on terrorist attacks, the government can just pay the welfare benefits in cash, only 30% less.",1
"Phoenix, AZ — Sitting in the front row during a comedy set with Jonathan Gregory is about the worst possible thing you could ever do in life. This guy knows how to work a room; picking out the weakest link and then devouring them with his hard-hitting, extremely uncomfortable, serial-killer-ish, style of humor. Nothing is off limits to Gregory.
I remember being at a party about a year ago with Jonathan. He walked up to me without saying a word. He then proceeded to look me directly in the eyes for what seemed like an eternity, then took his attention off me and gradually looked around the room, eying each person there. Then Gregory turns back to me and in a deep voice slowly says, “Which one would you kill first?”
With his signature black shirt, long hair and menacing facial expressions, this dude is creepy and it all adds to the fun of his act.
Gregory’s comedy, although unique and different, has been well received by a wide variety of audiences. This includes bars, theaters, world-class comedy clubs and even retirement homes. Gregory has over 10 million views on his YouTube page and his television credits include Showtime Boxing, NBC’s Last Comic Standing season 6, and E! Network’s True Hollywood Stories Investigates Hazing.
According to Gregory’s website, he spent over a year on a weekly morning radio program called “Think Tank Tuesday” which was part of the Morning Infidelity on KWSS 106.7FM. There his awkward take on the daily news brought laughter to listeners as they went about their morning commute. Gregory’s stand-up has been featured at the SLO Comedy Festival, Ventura Comedy Festival, the iO West Comedy Festival in Hollywood, Comedy Central’s “Up Next” Contest, Rooftop Comedy, and he was named Arizona’s best comedic writer by judges at the Tempe Improv.
So what is in store next for Jonathan Gregory? Well, I suppose that is the million dollar question. My guess: Prison or Conan.",1

"US marines have been sent to Syria to help the assault on the ISIS stronghold, Raqqa according to US officials.
Hundreds of marinesarmed with heavy artillery have arrived in Syria to support local allied forces in the operation to retake the Syrian city of Raqqa from ISIS.
The marines were deployed withoutthe permission ofthe Syrian government, Central Command chief Gen. Joseph Votel said ina congressional hearing onThursday.
“We are not,” Votel stated when asked whether US sent marines atthe request or withthe permission ofthe Syrian government. “We are looking atthat asan extension ofthe authority tooperate fromIraq.”
Marines from the San Diego-based 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit have deployed a battery of 155mm Howitzers to an outpost in Syria and “are ready to conduct their mission,” a US official told AFP on Thursday.
The deployment marks a significant move for conventional US forces in Syria, which have been limited to about 500 Special Operations forces on the ground.
Air Force Colonel John Dorrian, spokesman of the coalition purportedly fighting Daesh, said the additional forces, comprising a total of 400 Marines and Army Rangers, would be working with the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Syrian Arab Coalition.
Dorrian told Reuters that the artillery battery would help “expedite the defeat” of Daesh in Raqqah.
“We have had what I would describe as a pretty relentless air campaign to destroy enemy capabilities and to kill enemy fighters in that area already. That is something that we are going to continue and intensify with this new capability,” he said.
The move reflects tactics ahead of the assault on the Iraqi city of Mosul, where the US established bases outside the city as a platform for logistics and heavy artillery.
The SDF, which includes the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG), is the main US partner on the ground in Syria and has been fighting Daesh for months aroundRaqqah, the de facto capital of the terrorist group in the country.
Over the weekend, a separate force of elite US Army Rangers arrived in a town north-west of Raqqah in armored vehicles to head off a confrontation between Turkish and Syrian Kurdish fighters – both US allies.
The deployment was the first of its kind by the US in Manbij.
In a proposal presented to the White House last week, the Pentagon called for a significant increase in US military engagement in Syria including more Special Operations forces, attack helicopters and artillery.
Military planners proposed lifting the cap on military force level in Syria.
US officials say the troops would not be directly involved in ground combat. However, the proposal would allow them to operate closer to the front line and would delegate broader authority down the military line from the White House before an operation is launched.",1

"Having just been fired as commander of allied forces in Korea, a defiant Douglas MacArthur appeared before Congress and spoke of human suffering so horrifying that his parting glimpse of itcausedhim to vomit.
“I have never seen such devastation,” the general told members of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees. At that time, in May 1951, the Korean War was less thana year old. Casualties, he estimated, were already north of 1 million.
“I have seen, I guess, as much blood and disaster as any living man,” headded,“and it just curdled my stomach.”
It was a remarkable statement.At that time, the generalwasnot yet six years removed from having presided over the atomic bomb strikes thatcompelled Japan’s surrender in World War II.
[North Korea is the only country that has performed a nuclear test in the 21st century]
MacArthur’stestimonyrecirculated this week after President Trump, incensedby revelations about North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, declared that the United States would respond with “fire and fury” unless the regime in Pyongyang ceases itsthreatening behavior.
His pronouncementwas widelycriticized as unwise and provocative, and it appears he was quickly reminded of the consensus among experts, inside and outside of the administration, that to address North Korea’s aggression militarily would result in profound loss of life.
A day later, the commander in chief offered this:
On Thursday, Trumpescalated the rhetoric once more, saying that if North Koreaattacks, “things will happen to them like they never thought possible.”
Though spoken 66 years ago, MacArthur’s remarks to Congress are instructive even now.
They speak to the challenge of bringing about a peaceful resolution to a standoff that escalated dramatically, causing global alarm.
Bear in mindthat when MacArthur said this,itwould be another18 months before scientists tested the firsthydrogen bomb, capable of generating a nuclear blast far outmatching that which brought destruction upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
MacArthur had been fired by President Harry S. Truman for repeatedly — and publicly — disputing Truman’scautious approach to the Korean campaign. Rather, MacArthur favored the rapid deployment of overwhelming firepower and even called for striking targets inside China, confident his approachwould bring an end to the bloodshed.
Lawmakers werestunned by and suspicious of Truman’smotivation for sacking the general, and they wanted answers.
Sen. Brien McMahon, a Connecticut Democrat,was especially focused on the prospective use of atomic weapons and whether MacArthur believe such drastic measureswere necessary.
No, MacArthur replied, though at least one historical account contradicts the sincerity of his testimony.
McMahon: Have you at any time advocated the use of the atomic bomb in your theater?   MacArthur: The limit of what I did was to ask for information as to whether there were any plans to use the atomic bomb in the Far East. McMahon: Did you recommend its use? MacArthur: I did not. As I understand it, the use of the atomic bomb has, by fiat and order, been limited to the decision of the president of the United States.
MacArthur then broke off in a gripping account of suffering alreadyon display there.
I shrink with a horror that I cannot express in words, at this continuous slaughter of men in Korea. The battle casualties in Korea today probably have passed the million-man mark: Our own casualties, American casualties, have passed 65,000. The Koreans have lost about 140,000. Our losses, on our side, are a quarter of a million men. I am not talking of the civilian populations who must have lost many, many, many times that. The enemy probably has lost 750,000casualties. There are 145,000 of them that are now in our prison bullpens, prisoners, so they might be excepted from that figure because they live; but a million men in less than 11 months of fighting, in less than 11 months of this conflict, have already gone, and it grows more savage every day. I just cannot brush that off as a Korean skirmish. I believe that is something of such tremendous importance that it must be solved, and it cannot be solved by the nebulous process of saying ‘give us time, and we will be prepared; or we will be in better shape two years from now,’ which is argumentative. I don’t know whether we will or not; and neither do you. … But I say there is no chance in Korea, because it is a fact — you have lost a million men now. You will lose more than a million if you go on another year; if you go on until 1953, you will lose another million. What are you trying to protect? The war in Korea has already almost destroyed the nation of 20,000,000 people.
The Korean War endedmore than two years later. An estimated 2.9 million people wereleft dead, wounded or missing.
But the debate over whether to employ atomic weapons proved more agonizing than MacArthur’s testimony let on.
As Nathan A. Jennings wrote for Small Wars Journal, Trumanoutwardlyopposed use of the weapons but nonetheless had them positioned nearbyafter firing MacArthur.
Truman’s successor in the White House, Dwight D. Eisenhower, indicated before taking office that the nation’s growing nuclear arsenal gave it an unrivaled advantage and should be employed for strategic gain against purely military targets. After his election win, theretiredArmy general huddled withMacArthur, who advisedan aggressive strategywas necessary in Korea, including the use of atomic bombs.
“One possibility,” Eisenhower wrote in his memoirs, “was to let the Communist authorities understand that, in the absence of satisfactory progress, we intend to move decisively without inhibition in our use of weapons, and would no longer be responsible for confining hostilities to the Korean peninsula. We would not be limited by any world-wide gentleman’s agreement.”
It never proved necessary, though. The threat alone was enough to bring about the war’s end.
This post has been updated to reflect skepticism about the sincerity of MacArthur’s testimony.

"New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said the future of NFL broadcasts is in “over the top” deals like the livestreaming agreement the NFL signed with Amazon this spring.
Amazon will charge advertisers $2.8 million for an “OTT” ad package around its 10 Thursday night games, Reuters revealed on Thursday. Amazon paid $50 million for the non-exclusive rights to NFL games starting this season, nudging aside Twitter, which had paid $10 million to stream Thursday night NFL games last season.
“There has been a dramatic shift,” Kraft said at Cannes Lions, speaking as part of an interview with WPP Group CEO Martin Sorrell. “This year we’re with Amazon and for us the future is OTT.”
Kraft continued: “We’ll be very interested to see how Amazon goes as it’s behind the paywall. The thing we have to be careful of is millennials. They don’t watch TV, they don’t have TVs or subscribe to cable. So we have to bring that audience in. Partly it’s done through fantasy games and linking to that. Over-the-top is a great opportunity.”
Amazon will air the games to members of its $99-a-year subscription service, Amazon Prime Video.
Kraft said he would also like to see the NFL expand internationally, a goal that the league has yet to fully realize, he noted.
“Now we play four games a year in London and sell tickets to 80,000 people and we’re going to have a team in London,” Kraft said. “We’re playing the Raiders in Mexico and have plans to play in Germany, Canada and Brazil and China. I don’t know why not France?”
Kraft also was asked about how he feels now about “Deflategate,” the controversy in which Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was accused of deliberately underinflating footballs during the 2014-2015 playoff season.
“I don’t hold grudges but I never forget,” Kraft responded. “Sometimes people mess up at when they’re doing their jobs, but it most organizations people make bad decisions. I’m about the present and the future.”
“We were unfairly punished but we wound up winning the Super Bowl.”
Sorrell also asked about Kraft’s thoughts on FBI director James Comey’s firing. Kraft dodged on that one, but had some words of support for his friend President Trump’s economic plan for the US.
“His economic plan if executed well, will be excellent for America and the Western world,” Kraft said. We have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Two to five trillion dollars is parked outside of America, he has a plan to bring that money back and put it into manufacturing jobs. It could be a great uplift for the economy.”
Kraft who recalled a time when money was tight in his home and even a season ticket was a luxury.
“One of my big concerns is people like ourselves have done well, but working class people have not. It behooves us to get government working together to take care of them and get them the proper healthcare.”",0
"“It,” based on the Stephen King horror story, topped the box office in a record-breaking debut for a September release, a sign of hope for an industry reeling from its worst summer in more than a decade.
Viral marketing featuring a creepy clown and a red balloon helped drive excitement around “It,” which collected an estimated $117.2 million in sales in U. S. and Canadian theaters for distributor Warner Bros., researcher ComScore Inc. said Sunday in an email. The total beat estimates by a wide margin. The other new release of the weekend, romantic comedy “Home Again,” placed second with $9.03 million.
The blowout success of“It” is a boost for Warner Bros.’ Toby Emmerich, who was promoted in December from the New Line label to lead the studio’s film division. The movie had been in various stages of development, but Emmerich’s New Line helped get it made, and critics responded with glowing reviews.
The film is the first of several highly anticipated releases in September and the fourth quarter that may help Hollywood make up some of the ground it lost in the summer, when movies from “Baywatch” to “King Arthur” failed to connect with audiences.
Through the weekend, movies had collected $7.76 billion in U. S. and Canadian theaters, down 5.5 percent from a year earlier. But with films such as “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and “Justice League” on the way, sales may climb in the double digits in the fourth quarter, disproving the notion that filmgoers are sick of sequels, said Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley & Co.
“It will show movie fans are still out there, and hopefully put away the ‘sequel-itis’ issue,” Wold said. If the industry does well in the rest of 2017, the idea that“moviegoing is dead” will go away, he said.
September traditionally is known as a poor month at the box office, but films such as sequel “Kingsman: The Golden Circle” from 20th Century Fox and “The Lego Ninjago Movie” from Warner Bros. could change that. “September will probably tell us where we are going to be at year end,” said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co.
The fall also will include the usual run of awards contenders, with high box-office hopes for the trifecta of Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in “The Post,” about the 1971 battle to publish the Pentagon Papers.
Wold estimates box-office revenue will drop in the low single digits this year, even with the fourth-quarter surge. Shawn Robbins, analyst at BoxOfficePro.com said, projects this year’s total will reach as high as $11.36 billion, just shy of the 2016 total.
“It,” with a production budget of $35 million, surged past Warner Bros.’ initial expectation for a debut of about $65 million. Other analysts had the opening pegged higher, with Box Office Mojo going into the weekend forecasting $85 million and Hollywood Stock Exchange predicting $77 million.
The movie screened in 4,103 theaters, the widest release ever for an R-rated film, according to Box Office Mojo. “It” more than doubled the previous record for a September debut, set by “Hotel Transylvania 2” with $48.5 million in 2015. The previous largest opening weekend for an R-rated horror feature was held by “Paranormal Activity 3” with $52.6 million.
“The Exorcist” from 1973 holds the record for largest domestic gross for R-rated horror films with $233 million, according to Box Office Mojo.
“It” taps into the same vein of 1980s nostalgia that made Netflix Inc.’s “Stranger Things” such a hit. The movie is an adaptation of King’s 1986 novel, which was made into an award -winning TV miniseries in 1990 featuring Tim Curry.
Warner Bros.’ latest incarnation of the freaky clown Pennywise is played by Bill Skarsgard. Directed by Andy Muschietti and co-written by Cary Fukunaga, who directed the first season of HBO’s ‘‘True Detective,’’ the film recounts the tale of a group of bullied kids who band together to kill the creep who’s been hunting local children. The movie scored 89 percent positive reviews, according to RottenTomatoes.com, with critics praising the acting and suspense.
“Home Again” features Reese Witherspoon as single mom Alice Kinney, who moves back to her hometown of Los Angeles with her two daughters. Her life changes when she meets three filmmakers who she lets move in. Only 29 percent of critics gave it a positive review, according to RottenTomatoes.",0
"The Canadian government will apologize and give millions to a former Guantanamo Bay prisoner who pleaded guilty to killing a U. S. soldier in Afghanistan when he was 15, an official said Tuesday.
An official familiar with the matter told the Associated Press that Omar Khadr will receive $8 million. The deal was negotiated with Khadr’s lawyers and the Canadian government last month.
Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U. S. troops following a firefight at a suspected Al Qaeda compound in Afghanistan that resulted in the death of U.S. Special Forces medic, U.S. Army Sgt. First Class Christopher Speer. Khadr, who was suspected of throwing the grenade that killed Speer, was taken to Guantanamo and ultimately charged with war crimes by a military commission.
The Canadian-born Khadr pleaded guilty in 2010 to charges that included murder and was sentences to eight years plus the time he had already spent in custody. He returned to Canada two years later to serve the remainder of his sentence and was released in May 2015 pending an appeal of his guilty plea, which he said was made under duress.
The Canadian Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that Canadian intelligence obtained evidence from Khadr under “oppressive circumstances,” such as sleep deprivation, during interrogations at Guantanamo Bay in 2003, and then shared that evidence with U. S officials.
His lawyers filed a $20 million wrongful imprisonment lawsuit against the Canadian government, arguing the government violated international law by not protecting its own citizen and conspired with the U. S. in its abuse of Khadr.
The widow of Speer and another American soldier blinded by the grenade in Afghanistan filed a wrongful death and injury lawsuit against Khadr in 2014 fearing Khadr might get his hands on money from his $20 million wrongful imprisonment lawsuit. A U. S. judge granted $134.2 million in damages in 2015, but the plaintiffs acknowledged then that there was little chance they would collect any of the money from Khadr because he lives in Canada.
Khadr's lawyers have long said he was pushed into war by his father, Ahmed Said Khadr, whose family stayed with Usama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy. Khadr's Egyptian-born father was killed in 2003 when a Pakistani military helicopter shelled the house where he was staying with senior Al Qaeda operatives.
After his 2015 release from prison in Alberta, Omar Khadr apologized to the families of the victims. He said he rejects violent jihad and wants a fresh start to finish his education and work in health care. He currently resides in an apartment in Edmonton, Alberta.

"One of the most curious ancient maps is the120 Million-year-old map called ‘the map of the creator’. According to Russian experts, the maps is a staggering 120 million years old, and depicts the Ural Mountains and includes a series of civil engineering projects and around 12,000 kilometers of channels, dams, and hieroglyphs of an unknown origin.
In today’s society, the concept of the map is closely linked to new technologies, browsers, and Google Maps,a kind of magic modern window through which we can discover the world. However, hundreds and even thousands of years ago people created all sorts of maps leading to mysterious places. In this article, we take a look at three mysterious ancient maps that most of the readers probably never heard of before.
The oldest astrological map of the world
The sky has been mapped since antiquity as shown by this astrological chart discovered in 1983 inside a funeral chamber in Ausaka, a town in the prefecture of Nara, Japan.
The Kitora Tomb, as it is known, was built during the VII and VIII centuries as a resting place for an aristocrat of the reign of Emperor Tenmu.
The small pantheon, 1 meter in height and around 2.4 long, is perfectly aligned with the four cardinal points indicated with their respective symbols: Northern Black Turtle, Eastern Blue Dragon, Southern Red Bird, and Western White Tiger.
Curiously, on the roof of the tomb, we find an astrological mural composed of a series of concentric circles that overlap at some points, between which we find depictions of the constellations, represented by small discs of golden sheets.
In this intricate ancient composition, we can also see numerous mythological elements and the zodiacal signs.
The Dahska stone is a rather controversial artifact that according to many is one of the oldest maps of the world.
Also known as the map of the creator, the stone tablet has baffled experts ever since it was discovered in 1999. While some consider it ludicrous, Russian scientists estimate that this stone map is around 120 million years old.
According to reports, the Dashka stone map depicts the Ural Mountains and includes a series of civil engineering projects and around 12,000 kilometers of channels, dams, and hieroglyphs of an unknown origin.
Experts believe that given the accuracy and perspective, the map was created from an aerial point of observations. Archeologists from the Bashkir State University discovered the Dashka stone in the Ural Mountains of eastern Russia on July 21, 1999.
This recently found map was discovered at the site of Moli del Salt in Spain and is believed to date back to the Upper Paleolithic, some 13,800 years ago. According to reports, it depicts a hunter-gatherer campsite.
The mapwas carved on a slab roughly 18 centimeters wide, 8.5 centimeters high and around 3.6 centimeters thick. Dr. Manuel Vaquero of the Rovira and Virgili University and Dr. Marcos García-Diez of the University of the Basque Country said that: “It displays seven semicircular motifs.”
The Moli del Salt slab is now housed in the Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.",1
"US authorities have prepared charges to seek the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN.
The Justice Department investigation of Assange and WikiLeaks dates to at least 2010, when the site first gained wide attention for posting thousands of files stolen by the former US Army intelligence analyst now known as Chelsea Manning.
This latest revelation comes after CIA Director Mike Pompeo ramped up the Trump administration’s rhetoric against WikiLeaks describing it as a“non-state hostile intelligence service”earlier this week. Ironically, aswe noted this morning, Pompeo’s comments can just days before theFBI and CIA admitted that they are searching for an “insider” at the CIA (not a Russian)who exposed thousands of top-secret documents that described CIA tools used to penetrate smartphones, smart televisions and computer systems.
Last week in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, CIA Director Mike Pompeo went further than any US government official in describing a role by WikiLeaks that went beyond First Amendment activity.
He said WikiLeaks “directed Chelsea Manning to intercept specific secret information, and it overwhelmingly focuses on the United States.”
“It’s time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is: A non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia,”Pompeo said.
Pompeo’s comments were, of course, met with an immediate snarky reply from Assange over twitter.
For the past several years, U. S. prosecutors have struggled with whether the First Amendment precluded the prosecution of Assange. In fact, in what now appears to be a very prescient opinion piece, Julian Assange recently penned an article in theWashington Postdefending his publications by saying that hismotives are “identical to those claimed by the New York Times and The Post.”
Quite simply, our motive is identical to that claimed by the New York Times and The Post — to publish newsworthy content. Consistent with the U. S. Constitution, we publish material that we can confirm to be true irrespective of whether sources came by that truth legally or have the right to release it to the media.And we strive to mitigate legitimate concerns, for example by using redaction to protect the identities of at-risk intelligence agents.
During President Barack Obama’s administration, Attorney General Eric Holder and officials at the Justice Department determined it would be difficult to bring charges against Assange because WikiLeaks wasn’t alone in publishing documents stolen by Manning. Several newspapers, including The New York Times, did as well. The investigation continued, but any possible charges were put on hold, according to US officials involved in the process then.
All that said, CNN’s sources seem to believe those same prosecutors have now found a way to move forward…though we’re sure the New York Times won’t receive similar arrest warrants.
Of course, it’s unclear what immediate purpose the charges will serve given that Assange is holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for the sole purpose of avoiding political persecution. That said,somehow we suspect that some form of ‘leverage’ is about to be applied against Ecuador to help them ‘remember’ that they have other immediate and critically important uses for Assange’s London bedroom.
And this pretty much sums it up:
US authorities have prepared charges to seek the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN.
The Justice Department investigation of Assange and WikiLeaks dates to at least 2010, when the site first gained wide attention for posting thousands of files stolen by the former US Army intelligence analyst now known asChelsea Manning.
Prosecutors have struggled with whether the First Amendment precluded the prosecution of Assange, but now believe they have found a way to move forward.
During President Barack Obama’s administration, Attorney General Eric Holder and officials at the Justice Department determined it would be difficult to bring charges against Assange because WikiLeaks wasn’t alone in publishing documents stolen by Manning. Several newspapers, including The New York Times, did as well. The investigation continued, but any possible charges were put on hold, according to US officials involved in the process then.
The US view of WikiLeaks and Assange began to change after investigators found what they believe was proof that WikiLeaks played an active role in helping Edward Snowden, a former NSA analyst, disclose a massive cache of classified documents.
Then and now: Donald Trump’s reversal on leaks
Assange remains holed up in theEcuadorian embassy in London, seeking to avoid an arrest warrant onrape allegations in Sweden. In recent months, US officials had focused on the possibility that a new government in Ecuador would expel Assange and he could be arrested. But the left-leaning presidential candidate whowon the recent electionin the South American nation has promised to continue to harbor Assange.
Last week in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, CIA Director Mike Pompeo went further than any US government official indescribing a role by WikiLeaks that went beyond First Amendment activity.
He said WikiLeaks “directed Chelsea Manning to intercept specific secret information, and it overwhelmingly focuses on the United States.”
“It’s time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is: A non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia,” Pompeo said.
US intelligence agencies have also determined that Russian intelligence used WikiLeaks to publish emails aimed at undermining the campaign of Hillary Clinton, as part of a broader operation to meddle in the US 2016 presidential election. Hackers working for Russian intelligence agencies stole thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee and officials in the Clinton campaign and used intermediaries to pass along the documents to WikiLeaks, according to a public assessment by US intelligence agencies.
Still, the move could be viewed as political, since Assange is untouchable as long as he remains in the Ecuadorian embassy, and Ecuador has not changed its stance on Assange’s extradition.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a news conference Thursday that Assange’s arrest is a “priority.”
“We are going to step up our effort and already are stepping up our efforts on all leaks,” he said. “This is a matter that’s gone beyond anything I’m aware of. We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks and some of them are quite serious. So yes, it is a priority. We’ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail.”
“We’ve had no communication with the Department of Justice and they have not indicated to me that they have brought any charges against Mr. Assange,” said Assange’s lawyer, Barry Pollack. “They’ve been unwilling to have any discussion at all, despite our repeated requests, that they let us know what Mr. Assange’s status is in any pending investigations. There’s no reason why WikiLeaks should be treated differently from any other publisher.”
Pollack said WikiLeaks is just like the Washington Post and the New York Times, which routinely publish stories based on classified information. WikiLeaks, he says, publishes information that is in “the public’s interest to know not just about the United States but other governments around the world.”
Assange has also compared WikiLeaks to a news media organization that uses documents provided by whistleblowers to expose the actions of governments and powerful corporations.
“Quite simply, our motive is identical to that claimed by the New York Times and The Post — to publish newsworthy content,” Assange wrote ina recent op-ed in The Washington Post. “Consistent with the U. S. Constitution, we publish material that we can confirm to be true irrespective of whether sources came by that truth legally or have the right to release it to the media. And we strive to mitigate legitimate concerns, for example by using redaction to protect the identities of at-risk intelligence agents.”
In his speech last week, Pompeo rejected that characterization and said Assange should not be afforded constitutional free speech protections.
“Julian Assange has no First Amendment freedoms. He’s sitting in an Embassy in London. He’s not a US citizen,” Pompeo said.
Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that based on CNN’s reporting, “I’m glad that the Justice Department has found a way to go after Assange. He’s gotten a free ride for too long.”
King said Assange has “caused tremendous damage to our national security, put American lives at risk.”
But Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, argued that US prosecution of Assange sets a dangerous precedent.
“Never in the history of this country has a publisher been prosecuted for presenting truthful information to the public,” Wizner told CNN. “Any prosecution of WikiLeaks for publishing government secrets would set a dangerous precedent that the Trump administration would surely use to target other news organizations.”",1
"With less than two weeks to go before the start of the NFL regular season, league quarterback Colin Kaepernick is still without a job.
Over the offseason, football teams have continually chosen not to sign Kaepernick, which has led his supporters to cry racism. Now the NAACP and ACLU are getting more involved in the situation by demanding an NFL team hire Kaepernick. Fox News host Tucker Carlson spoke with an Atlanta NAACP leader Friday night about the demand.
Racism or not?
Gerald Griggs, vice president of the NAACP’s Atlanta chapter, told Carlson the NFL must answer why its 17th best quarterback — based on QB rating — doesn’t have a job despite the league employing more than 90 quarterbacks.
Since Kaepernick is such a skilled player, yet he doesn’t have a job, how does race or his national anthem protests not play a part in his unemployment, Griggs said.
Carlson, on the other hand, pointed out that 70 percent of the NFL’s players are black, which he said disqualifies any claim the league is racist. He also noted that Kaepernick has made tens of millions of dollars playing professional football and even signed one of the league’s biggest contracts ever in 2014.
“Just on the basis of those facts alone, it’s hard to see how Colin Kaepernick at 29 is a victim of racism,” Carlson said.
The ‘obvious’ question..
After arguing back and forth, Carlson reiterated the “obvious” question: “If [NFL] owners are racist, why are 70 percent of their employees black? Wouldn’t they not want to hire black people if they were racist and pay them hundreds of millions of dollars?”
“This is about talent — and, again, his talent speaks for itself,” Griggs answered. “If there’s no other reason than talent that’s keeping him off the field, I think that’s a question better asked to the owners.”
It’s that important?
Carlson then shifted the conversation and grilled Griggs over problems that plague the black community, such as 70 percent of children being born to unmarried parents.
“Is that a bigger problem or a smaller problem than Colin Kapernick getting another $126 million contract?” Carlson questioned.
The tense exchange
Griggs responded by asking what the rate is in Atlanta, but Carlson was quickly becoming unnerved by the conversation.
“Here you are sucking up to a guy who signed a $126 million contract. You think in a country of 320 million [people] you could actually find someone who’s actually a victim of racism or oppression,” Carlson chided. “But this guy is 29 years old and has more money than god — he’s the victim?”
“There are a lot of people who might need your help,” he added. “How is Kaepernick one of them?”
“This is about talent. This is about the NFL. This is about the NFL needing to answer the question why the 17th best quarterback in the league is out of a job,” Griggs explained.
“Your position is so absurd,” Carlson shot back. “Do you feel that your devaluing any of your moral authority by taking your time and energy defending 29-year-old millionaires against fake accusations of racism.
Griggs responded by again saying there’s no “real reason” Kaepernick isn’t signed to a team. “We are sending a strong message to [NFL commissioner] Roger Goodell…if he decides not to meet with us, then we will decide to take appropriate actions after that.”",1
"Thanks in part to TuckerCarlson, Fox News viewership is up double digits from the second quarter in 2016.
For 62 straight quarters, Fox has been the most-watched cable news network — a streak that dates back to 2001.
Tucker Carlson has been beating Rachel Maddowhandily for a while now and came out as the most watched show in cable news,Western Journalismreported.
But NOW it’s just getting outright humiliating.
“In total day, FNC averaged 1.5 million in total viewers (up 27 percent) and 314,000 (up 46 percent). In prime time, FNC delivered 2.4 million in total viewers (up 19 percent) and 472,000 (up 34 percent) in the 25-54 demo,” the network stated in a release.
The most watched program on Fox and cable news overall for the quarter wasTucker Carlson Tonight,which averaged 2.7 million viewers to MSNBC’sThe Rachel Maddow Show’s2.52 million andHannity’s2.51 million.
Maddow was the most-watched among adults ages 25-54, averaging 604,000 viewers to Hannity’s 550,000 and Carlson’s 541,000.
Carlson’s program saw a 16-percent increase for the quarter for the key 25-54 demographic, the group most valuable to advertisers.
MSNBC remains No. 3 behind both Fox News and CNN in daytime viewers.
Fox Business Network also received good rating news for the second quarter with a win over rival CNBC.
The No. 1 finish marked the third quarter in a row Fox Business has topped CNBC, a first for Fox Business since its launch in 2007.
Someone said Tucker isn’t a strong Trump defender, not always, but Tucker is a defender of truth and facts.
However, when it comes to total viewers, Maddow still has a long way to go if she ever hopes to beat Carlson!",1

"The US is not only illegally occupying a military base in Syria, but they are using their position to attack pro- Syrian government forces claiming that they are the threat.
The Syrian forces were fighting ISIS in the area, so why did the US military attack them?…..aren’t they supposed to be pursuing ISIS as well?
Russia has now demanded that the U. S. stop attacking forces that support the Syrian government as they overtake positions held by ISIS on the country’s border with Iraq.
Ron Paul asks “Why Are We Attacking the Syrians Who Are Fighting ISIS?”
Just when you thought our Syria policy could not get any worse, last week it did. The US military twice attacked Syrian government forces from a military base it illegally occupies inside Syria. According to the Pentagon, the attacks on Syrian government-backed forces were “defensive” because the Syrian fighters were approaching a US self-declared “de-confliction” zone inside Syria. The Syrian forces were pursuing ISIS in the area, but the US attacked anyway.
The US is training yet another rebel group fighting from that base, located near the border of Iraq at al-Tanf, and it claims that Syrian government forces pose a threat to the US military presence there. But the Pentagon has forgotten one thing: it has no authority to be in Syria in the first place! Neither the US Congress nor the UN Security Council has authorized a US military presence inside Syria.
So what gives the Trump Administration the right to set up military bases on foreign soil without the permission of that government? Why are we violating the sovereignty of Syria and attacking its military as they are fighting ISIS? Why does Washington claim that its primary mission in Syria is to defeat ISIS while taking military actions that benefit ISIS?
The Pentagon issued a statement saying its presence in Syria is necessary because the Syrian government is not strong enough to defeat ISIS on its own. But the “de-escalation zones” agreed upon by the Syrians, Russians, Iranians, and Turks have led to a reduction in fighting and a possible end to the six-year war. Even if true that the Syrian military is weakened, its weakness is due to six years of US-sponsored rebels fighting to overthrow it!
What is this really all about? Why does the US military occupy this base inside Syria? It’s partly about preventing the Syrians and Iraqis from working together to fight ISIS, but I think it’s mostly about Iran. If the Syrians and Iraqis join up to fight ISIS with the help of Iranian-allied Shia militia, the US believes it will strengthen Iran’s hand in the region. President Trump has recently returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia where he swore he would not allow that to happen.
But is this policy really in our interest, or are we just doing the bidding of our Middle East “allies,” who seem desperate for war with Iran? Saudi Arabia exports its radical form of Islam worldwide, including recently into moderate Asian Muslim countries like Indonesia. Iran does not. That is not to say that Iran is perfect, but does it make any sense to jump into the Sunni/Shia conflict on either side? The Syrians, along with their Russian and Iranian allies, are defeating ISIS and al-Qaeda. As candidate Trump said, what’s so bad about that?
We were told that if the Syrian government was allowed to liberate Aleppo from al-Qaeda, Assad would kill thousands who were trapped there. But the opposite has happened: life is returning to normal in Aleppo. The Christian minority there celebrated Easter for the first time in several years. They are rebuilding. Can’t we finally just leave the Syrians alone?
When you get to the point where your actions are actually helping ISIS, whether intended or not, perhaps it’s time to stop. It’s past time for the US to abandon its dangerous and counterproductive Syria policy and just bring the troops home.",1

"NEW YORK - Admirers of Steve Jobs may never drive technology to the cutting edge, but at least they can drive his car.
The late Apple founder's 2000 BMW Z8 convertible is one of 30 vehicles up for auction in December in Manhattan, and the price is only $300,000. That's a fraction of the cost of a number of the other vehicles that are available.
Bidders at the fantasy-fueled RM Sotheby's auction might steer toward a handsomely earth-toned 1961 Ferrari 250 GT Cabriolet Series II by Pininfarina, which has a pre-sale estimate of about $1.5 million to $1.8 million. They'll also have the chance to peruse a white, ""ultimate street-legal"" 1995 Porsche 911 GT2, which has a pre-sale estimate of about $1.1 million to $1.4 million, and a red 1952 Chrysler D'Elegance by Ghia, with a pre-sale estimate of about $900,000 to $1.1 million.
But bidders may instead choose to geek out on Jobs' former ride - a model that served as ""a test bed for new engineering technologies,"" said the auction house. ""While not a car enthusiast per se,"" Jobs did have ""a penchant for German design.""
The tech genius got his BMW in October 2000 in the minimalist style he is known for- titanium over a black leather interior. He sold it in 2003 to another tech executive, according to RM Sotheby's.
""Not only was the Z8 the halo car for an iconic brand and the Bond car for a generation, but it caught the eye of the most iconic and influential entrepreneur of our time,"" said Don Rose, RM Sotheby's car specialist.
Although it's changed hands a couple of times, the 400 brake horsepower vehicle only clocked 15,200 miles (24460.89 kilometers).
The car comes with a copy of its old California registration, under the name ""Jobs, Steven P."" It also comes with a hardtop, cover, manuals and an old school flip-phone -- ironically, a BMW-branded Motorola.
Out of garage space, but not out of bucks? A race suit and helmet might fit the bill. Steve McQueen wore them in the 1971 movie ""Le Mans"" and they're expected to sell for $400,000 to $500,000.",0
"US warplanes have killed at least 42 Syrian civilians in a mosque during an air raid overnight in a village west of Aleppo.
Over 100 other people were wounded in the air raid on the village of al-Jineh, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed on Friday.
US military officials confirmed that it carried out a deadly airstrike in northern Syria, but have denied deliberately bombing the mosque.
The observatorysaid many people were still trapped under the collapsed mosque asrescue workers struggled to pull survivors from rubble, and dozens of residents were still unaccounted for.
Jineh is in the western Aleppo countryside, which along with Idlib is home to hundreds of thousands of Syrians displaced by fighting in other areas.
Abu Muhammed, a village resident, told AFP he heard powerful explosions when the mosque was hit. “It was right after the prayer at a time where there are usually religious lessons for men in it,” he said.
“I saw 15 bodies and lots of body parts in the debris when I arrived. We couldn’t even recognize some of the bodies,” he added.
The US-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against what are said to be Daesh terrorists inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate. It has alo been involved in a similar campaign in neighboring Iraq.
The alliance has on many occasions attacked Syrian civilians, military andinfrastructure under the guise of fighting the terror group.
There are also reports that the US-led attacks have on numerous occasions hampered counterterrorism operations by Syrian armed forces.
The latest US air raid came just after Syria contacted the United Nations to warn against an imminent disaster in the wake of air raids by the US-led military coalition close to the Euphrates and Tishrin dams.
Damascus urged UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to help stop the attacks, “The total destruction of these dams that are being targeted by the airstrikes will wash away and flood cities, towns and villages, endangering the lives of hundreds of thousands of people living in those areas.”
Washington has currently between 800 and 900 Special Operations troops in Syria. A Pentagon official told AFP on Wednesday that the United States is set to deploy about 1,000 additional troops to the northern parts of the country.
In an interview with Chinese TV station Phoenix, Syrian President Bashar al-Assadcalled the US troops in Syria invadersbecause under international law foreign governments cannot deploy troops to sovereign countries.
“Any foreign troops coming to Syria without our invitation… are invaders,” said the Syrian leader.
The bloody US attack comes amid a countrywide ceasefire in Syria in parallel with a diplomatic process aimed at ending the crisis in the Arab state.",1

"Isn’t it interesting how the whole recall story has unfolded? Think about it:
– First, Donald Trump won both the popular* and electoral vote** hands down.
– Then, rent-a-mobs descended into American cities raising heck over the results of a fair electoral process.
– Next, Jill Stein somehow raised $5 million to conduct a recount in Wisconsin.
– America’s favorite coat-tail riders that never had a new idea between them latched on in hopes Hillary could come off her “I just wanted to sit on the couch with the dog and die” tour and instead move back into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
If this whole thing isn’t as stage managed as a performance of the play Hamilton in which the cast dutifully dress down the Vice President elect, then I don’t know the definition of stage managed. This whole thing smells fishier than the Jagalchi fish market in Busan, South Korea. Aside from the timeline consider:
– Jill Stein barely scraped together $3.5 million for her ENTIRE campaign and all the sudden she’s raised $5 million?
– Stein herself has acknowledged that the money she’s raised might not all go towards the recount.
– The belated Clinton involvement in all this. These are people that’ll dispatch Bill to “play the sax” for a Sudanese Sheikh in exchange for a handful of millions. And all the sudden Stein’s sitting on $5 million?
– Chelsea’s future political career is on the line with all this. Granted, at 36’ish she’s young but she’s already following in mom and dad’s baggage-toting footsteps.
– Barack Obama is effectively the head of the Jack Ass that is the Democrat Party these days. No one wants to say it but nothing happens without Barack’s blessing. Heck, reports even suggest he ordered Hillary to concede the election to Trump.
Something more than what the media is telling us is afoot here and I don’t like it. We may very well be on the precipice of a stolen election if we’re not careful.
* Subtract the usual DNC voter fraud and illegals that voted but weren’t allowed to and presto, Trump won the popular vote too.
** For those that say we need to get rid of the Electoral College allow me to remind you that in doing so, the result would be that three states pick our President and 47 have no say. Think about it.

"October 25, 2017; Washington D. C. - NPR's journalism and original programming reaches at least 99 million people every month across all platforms – broadcast and digital. This cross-platform estimate is based on Spring 2017's monthly broadcast cume, NPR.org visitors and podcast users.
""This stellar accomplishment is a measure of just how much America depends on NPR every day, from breaking news to investigative reporting to podcasting to music and cultural programs that celebrate the human experience,"" said NPR President and CEO Jarl Mohn.
NPR Member stations have grown their audience for five consecutive ratings periods in a row.
According to Nielsen Audio Spring 2017 ratings, the total weekly listeners for all programming on NPR stations reached an all-time high of 37.7 million.
There was no post-election drop: both Morning Edition and All Things Considered retained the remarkable growth seen during the Fall 2016 election cycle. Their weekly audience is at 14.63 million and 14.6 million listeners, respectively – continuing to be two of the largest news/talk radio programs in the country, and larger than many well-known television news programs. AQH growth continues to be strongest among those 25-44.
Millennials and GenXers are listening: across the country, over a quarter (28%) of all 25-54 year olds listened to an NPR Member station at least once a month, 16% listened at least once a week and 6% of all 25-54 listened at least once a day.
Increase in diverse audiences: Morning Edition saw a 10% gain, year over year, in weekly Hispanic listeners and 16% gain in Black/African American listeners while All Things Considered saw a 9% gain in Hispanic listeners and an 18% gain in Black/African American listeners.
As of August 2017, NPR Member stations are the leading radio news stations in 26 of the top 50 markets in mornings and 27 of 50 for afternoons (25-54 AQH). And public radio stations are the number one stations, all persons, for the full week in San Diego; Seattle; Portland; Washington, DC; San Francisco; and Boston (WBUR and WGBH combined.) There are other markets where it happens regularly like Austin, Texas and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.

"If your guess was: “Empire’s ratings just defied all the laws of broadcast television to once again riseto a record number” …then you would be right.
Wednesday’s episode hit 12.9 million viewers and a huge 5.1 rating among adults 18-49. That’s up 6 percent from last week in the demo (which, of course, was a record rating too).
In total viewers, Empire has gone up every single week – six total –since its premiere. Among adults 18-49, the series has risenfive out of six weeks.I asked one broadcast analystfor a historic comparison pointto help put the latest gaininto some kind of perspective compared to other dramas that have risen in the ratings over the years.The rep replied:“Don’t have any new historical references for its post-premiere growth. It has literally exceeded all Nielsen total viewerrecords to date.” In other words, after Empirebroke thatrecord a couple weeks ago where the hip-hop drama seriespostedmore consecutive ratings gains than any other new broadcast show in at least 23 years, the rise of Empire has become unprecidented.
There is, however,one drama left for Empire to beat in the demo, and it’s not on broadcast – AMC’s The Walking Dead. Sunday’s hour had a 6.2 rating. Until a couple weeks ago, I would have assumed TWDwould be out of reach of any other drama. Not anymore.",1
"Hurricane Harvey made landfall three weeks ago. Catastrophic floodwater from the storm left 70 dead and destroyed or damaged more than a quarter of a million homes. Now, as Houston and its surrounding areas begin to recover, people there are taking steps to head off a potential health threat: the mosquito population is expected to explode after Harvey left behind countless pools of stagnant water.
Harris County bug experts are on a seek-and-destroy mission, reports CBS News' Omar Villafranca. Mustapha Debboun, director of mosquito control for Harris County, says these are the perfect breeding conditions.
Asked how many mosquitoes two tires with water in them could breed, Debboun said, ""500 to 600, you know, 700 because a mosquito will lay a lot of eggs.""
To combat the threat of diseases like West Nile and Zika, an all-out assault has been launched. On the ground, Harris County trucks have sprayed more than 70,000 acres and for the past several nights, Air Force Reserve C-130 planes have flown over southeast Texas spraying an EPA-approved, mosquito-killing chemical.
The aerial bombardments have treated more than two million acres of Harris and other counties – more than 10 times the size of New York City.
But county officials say they can only do so much and need residents' help. Homeowners have hired personal mosquito squads, like Corey Barcomb, who says he's been going nonstop.
""[The] phone calls are, 'When can you get to us? Can you do it tomorrow? Can you do it today?'"" Barcomb said.
One of the biggest problem areas are private swimming pools. Many were flooded during the storm and have now become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Officials are urging residents to treat their own pools so they can stop the growing problem.",0

"PET is considered to be a major environmental hazard because it is highly resistant to breakdown
An estimated 342 million tons of plastic are produced annually worldwide, and currently, only about 14 percent is collected for recycling, according to the World Economic Forum.
Most plastic degrades extraordinarily slowly, but PET — short for polyethylene terephthalate — is especially durable, and about 61 million tons of the colorless plastic was produced worldwide in 2013 alone, according to the researchers. [In Photos: World’s Most Polluted Places]
Previously, the only species found to break down PET were rare fungi. Now, scientists in Japan have discovered bacteria that can biodegrade this hardy plastic.
“The bacterium is the first strain having a potential to degrade PET completely into carbon dioxide and water,” said study co-author Kohei Oda, an applied microbiologist at the Kyoto Institute of Technology in Japan.
The researchers collected 250 samples of PET debris from soil and wastewater from a plastic-bottle-recycling site. They scanned these samples for bacteria that could eat PET.
The scientists identified a new species of bacteria, which they named Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, that could almost completely break down a thin film of PET after six weeks at a temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). Appendages from the cells might have secreted compounds that helped to dissolve the plastic, the researchers said.
Genetic and biochemical analyses identified two key enzymes involved in the breakdown of PET. One enzyme worked with water to break down the plastic into an intermediate substance, which the other enzyme broke down into PET’s basic building blocks, the scientists said.
These findings could have a wide range of real-world applications, because bacteria should be easier to incorporate into devices to break down PET than fungi is. “We hope that we can develop a technology to handle such a lot of wasted PET,” Oda said.
In the future, the researchers would like to “improve the ability of the microorganisms to degrade,” Oda said.
It’s not known how these enzymes evolved, Oda said, and both enzymes bear little resemblance to the enzymes most closely related to them.
The scientists detailed their findings online March 10 in the journal Science.",1

A new study suggests that a hominin is to blame for modern genital herpes
It is the most likely culprit to help the disease jump the species barrier
(CNN)Herpes has been around a long time, to say the least.
Ancient chimpanzees genetically passed oral herpes (herpes simplex 1, or HSV-1) to the earliest humans millions of years ago when our lineage split. And we almost missed out on catching that other scourge, genital herpes (HSV-2) -- almost. Unlike HSV-1, HSV-2 didn't make the leap to early humans on its own.
Unfortunately for modern humans, millions of years ago, an early human ancestor was in the right place at the right time to catch HSV-2. And it might not have happened if it weren't for that meddling hominin species Paranthropus boisei, according to a new study in the journal Virus Evolution.
Standing at about 4 feet tall, boisei had a small brain and a wide, dish-like face. It is most well-known for having big teeth and hefty chewing muscles. One skull was nicknamed ""Nutcracker Man"" for these traits.
Neanderthals may have self-medicated long before pills, study shows
Boisei acted as the in-between agent for genital herpes to make the species jump from primates to humans, researchers say.

Ancient chimpanzees, boisei and Homo erectus were all in Africa between 1.4 million and 3 million years ago, in an area where the evolution of modern humans would occur. It would be easy for them to come into contact with each other around water sources.
HSV-2 itself was evolving at the time, and it could be spread orally.
The researchers believe that the circle of life caused this transmission, which would have to happen through fluid exchange. Chimpanzee bites or scratches would transfer the virus through sores.
So what about the human bloodline? According to the researchers, transfer could have happened through sexual intercourse or Homo erectus consuming boisei -- or both.
Why scientists reconstructed an ancient plague
""We can 'blame' our ancestors for eating other hominins/great apes, this has been the source of other primate-to-human infections such as HIV,"" Charlotte Houldcroft, senior study author and virologist at the University of Cambridge Department of Archaeology, wrote in an email. ""Eating other species closely related to oneself has risks, because pathogens adapted to species genetically similar to us will find it easier to jump the species barrier.""
The most genetically diverse strains of HSV-2 come from Africa, and the amount of worldwide HSV-2 genetic diversity points to an out-of-Africa migration, according to the researchers.
""Essentially, when humans migrated out of Africa, they already carried HSV-2, and wherever humans went, their viruses went too,"" Houldcroft said. ""HSV-2 infects for life and can be passed from mother to baby or between sexual partners, which made sure it successfully spread wherever humans did.""
But making this determination when there are gaps in the fossil record required more than just an analysis of old bones.
Is there a new human species waiting to be discovered?
""It's a really interesting question that is invisible to archaeology,"" Houldcroft said. ""Why wouldn't you want to try and solve the mystery?!""
The study brought together a virologist, an engineer and a researcher of human evolution to apply and develop a model to meld their areas of expertise.
They used Bayesian network modeling -- a graphical model using probability, random variables and conditional dependencies -- to combine data of ancient climates, herpes DNA and fossils and determine the probability of HSV-2 and how it might be transmitted.
""We can use data from diseases to reconstruct events that are completely invisible to the archaeological and fossil records,"" Houldcroft said. ""The signals in the HSV-2 virus are records of direct contact between the ancestors of us and chimps that we can tangibly now 'see' and gives us direct insight into the daily lives of our ancestors.""
The researchers said the biggest surprise was not the findings themselves but rather the discovery that their diverse backgrounds informed a different way to look at a problem and solve it creatively.
""Their combined use of bayesian models and AI to fit climate and environmental data with hominin fossils is insightful,"" Angelique Corthals, forensic anthropologist and assistant professor at the City University of New York, wrote in an email. ""It allows the research to redefine the jump of HSV-2 from from chimpanzees to humans.""
""The methods of this paper have strikingly important implications for the study of pathogen transmission and the appearance of potential epidemics, as it is able to predict, given a specific set of environmental and demographic/population-based data, a jump from wildlife disease to human,"" she wrote. ""Better yet, it is able to predict potential intermediate hosts, within the context of the evolutionary history of both the hosts and the pathogens.""

Corthals, who was not involved with the new research, said caution should be taken to ensure that the probability isn't overcomplicated because of the huge data set and amount of possible variables.
""Should the methods stand further scrutiny and data-modeling, (this) will have serious implications in how we model and prevent pandemics,"" Corthals said.
The research builds on a study from 2014 on the origin of human herpes viruses.
""We found that HSV-2 likely jumped from the ancestor of chimpanzees into a human ancestor, but we left it at that,"" wrote Joel Wertheim, assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego Department of Medicine and lead author of the 2014 study, in an email. ""This study continues our research through an unexpected avenue, looking at the prehistorical forest geography. This is not a line of inquiry I would have anticipated, but it provides a textured layer to the story of HSV origins.""
The researchers are now working with colleagues in South Africa and the United States to learn how other ancient conditions, like human pubic lice, transmitted to modern humans.
""The usual obstacles of not enough fossils and archaeological preservation are always present, but also contribute to making the subject such a compelling one,"" Houldcroft said.",0
"NEW YORK – In its first acquisition, Netflix (NFLX) is buying comic book publisher Millarworld and plans to turn its characters into new films and shows for the video streaming service.

"Members of the activist movement known as Anonymous are preparing to take to the streets around thw world in the second annual Million Mask March on 5 November.
To date 463 groups in towns and cities around the world have organised events to mark the Million Mask March on Wednesday, which coincides with Guy Fawkes Night.
The Guy Fawkes Mask has become an unofficial emblem of the online movement.
Last year hundreds of thousands of people took part in marches around the globe and just like the inaugural 2013 event, the Million Mask March on Wednesday aims “to shed light on corrupt government in order to set people free from oppression”.
Anonymous is not playing down the importance of the Million Mask March, dubbing it “the largest world protest by the most influential group in the world”.
A map which details the location of all 463 events registered so far shows just how global the movement is, with events scheduled to take place in Africa, Australia, Asia and South America, but the vast majority of events are concentrated in North America and Europe.
There is even an event planned to take place in Antartica.
In the UK, there are events organised in 22 towns and cities including Belfast, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Plymouth and of course London.
At the Million Mask March in London last year, 2,500 protestors showed up to vent their frustration at the UK government over a range of issues, including badger culling.
Comedian and potential London mayoral candidate in 2016, Russell Brand, made an appearance at the event last year and dominated the headlines while there was also some violence at the event with 15 arrests.
Reflecting the leaderless structure of Anonymous there appears to be two different details about the Million Mask March in London this year.
One will begin, like last year, in Trafalgar Square in central London at 6pm before marching on Westminster. The second is due to begin in Parliament Square near Westminster and is scheduled to begin at 8pm.
While this is just the second Million Mask March, Anonymous protestors in the UK have been marching since 2011 with just 500 people showing up.
However with the rapid increase in numbers, the Metropolitan Police is eager to speak to the organisers of this year’s events to try and make sure the event goes smoothly.
“It is important that they talk to us so that we can work together to achieve a safe and successful event,” Chief Superintendent Pippa Mills said.
IBTimes UK will be running a live blog of the Million Mask March on Wednesday, 5 November following events which will kick off in New Zealand and Australia across the globe to live coverage of the UK event on Wednesday evening.",1
"Trump’s revolutionary presidential win and promise of business friendly acumen has emboldened the big banks and Wall Street to lobby to push back the shackles that were placed on them at the onset of the “Great Recession.”
Their lobbyists have already ventured to Washington to plot and scheme toward a repeal or at least a loosening of the bank’s abilities to speculate with their shareholder’s money.
Instead of giving all the details, like how much more profit the banks can earn, lobbyists plan to focus on the fact that Volcker is reducing market liquidity, thereby hurting companies, investors and the economy.
What did the big banks do when they were bailed out by the stimulus, “TARP” money?
Did they use the windfall to cancel unsecured credit card debt and make short term business loans? NO.
Did they voluntarily offer lower, fixed interest loans on ARMs and other predatory loans that caused homeowners to lose their homes? NO
Let’s look at only two examples of why big banks cannot be trusted.
The scandals of mishandling and abuse of the deposit holders in Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase have resulted in large fines by the Banking Commission. Two of the incidents and fines are listed below.
In September and October of 2013, JP Morgan paid 920 million and 100 million dollar fines respectively and ADMITTED to “reckless conduct and market manipulation” in connection with the 2012 “London whale” trading debacle which caused 6 billion in losses. These are only two examples of the fines the banking institution had to pay for its reckless conduct with shareholder’s investments. There are eleven other infractions mentioned in the article below that involve fines of both millions and billions, not to mention the amounts that investors lost because of their recklessness.
However, the CEO, Jamie Dimon received a 7.4-million-dollar cash incentive bonus this year. His salary has been consistent since 2014, of 1.5 million in base salary plus large stock options.
Not bad work, when you can get it.
Wells Fargo is no stranger to fines and penalties for abuses of financial trust.
Recently, it was discovered that Wells Fargo put so much pressure on its employees to open new accounts that they were forced to do so without many of their client’s knowledge.
The bank has now been fined 185 million for their “outrageous sales culture.”
But wait, there’s more, as if destroying the trust of their investors and depositors was not enough. Wells Fargo had to pay 1.2 billion for improper mortgage lending practices, admitting that they certified loans that were not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance and the bank did not disclose thousands of faulty mortgage loans to HUD, according to the Department of Justice. Ordinary people would go directly to jail if caught doing either one of these things or even just lying or misrepresenting themselves on an application for a FHA loan.
Yet in 2013, Wells Fargo’s CEO, John Stumpf, won the dubious title of winner for the most salary in the banking business. His yearly wages are 22.87 million. The company reported that the huge amount was justified due to the strong showing in 2012, earning 18.9 billion.
Un-huh, sure, it did, it is easy to see how that profit margin came into play.
Apart from the all the big bank’s illegal didoes, the Federal Government has been practicing Quantative Easing for the last eight years, a policy where a central bank (The Federal Bank) creates new electronic money in order to buy government bonds or other financial assets to stimulate the economy. This is put into play when standard monetary policy cannot uphold a failing currency.
This artificially inflates the stock market, causing the economy to appear much healthier than it actually is, meaning the rich do beyond great and the rest of the working people not so much.
It appears that both Wall Street and the Big Banks are guilty as charged in their destructive role in the “Great Recession”.
No easing of regulation is warranted here.
If allowed a free rein, these two groups will not only NOT help the economy, (except their own,) they will put the US and the world RIGHT BACK to the crash in 2008!
Stand up, and write or call your elected representatives in Washington letting them know that no easing or repealing of the Frank Dodd/Volcker Act will be forthcoming!!!

"Sen. Sanders responded to the lecture from America’s CEO’s by releasing a report that detailed how 18 of them have helped blow up the deficit and wreck the economy by outsourcing jobs and evading US taxes.
There really is no shame. The Wall Street leaders whose recklessness and illegal behavior caused this terrible recession are now lecturing the American people on the need for courage to deal with the nation’s finances and deficit crisis. Before telling us why we should cut Social Security, Medicare and other vitally important programs, these CEOs might want to take a hard look at their responsibility for causing the deficit and this terrible recession.
Our Wall Street friends might also want to show some courage of their own by suggesting that the wealthiest people in this country, like them, start paying their fair share of taxes. They might work to end the outrageous corporate loopholes, tax havens and outsourcing provisions that their lobbyists have littered throughout the tax code – contributing greatly to our deficit.
Many of the CEO’s who signed the deficit-reduction letter run corporations that evaded at least $34.5 billion in taxes by setting up more than 600 subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens since 2008. As a result, at least a dozen of the companies avoided paying any federal income taxes in recent years, and even received more than $6.4 billion in tax refunds from the IRS since 2008.
Several of the companies received a total taxpayer bailout of more than $2.5 trillion from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department.
Many of the companies also have outsourced hundreds of thousands of American jobs to China and other low wage countries, forcing their workers to receive unemployment insurance and other federal benefits. In other words, these are some of the same people who have significantly caused the deficit to explode over the last four years.
Here are the 18 CEO’s Sanders labeled job destroyers in his report. (All data fromTop Corporate Dodgers report.)
1). 1. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan
Amount of federal income taxes paid in 2010?Zero. $1.9 billion tax refund.
Taxpayer Bailout from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department?Over $1.3 trillion.
Amount of federal income taxes Bank of America would have owed if offshore tax havens were eliminated?$2.6 billion.
2). Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein
Amount of federal income taxes paid in 2008?Zero. $278 million tax refund.
Taxpayer Bailout from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department?$824 billion.
Amount of federal income taxes Goldman Sachs would have owed if offshore tax havens were eliminated?$2.7 billion
3). JP Morgan Chase CEO James Dimon
Taxpayer Bailout from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department?$416 billion.
Amount of federal income taxes JP Morgan Chase would have owed if offshore tax havens were eliminated?$4.9 billion.
4). General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt
Amount of federal income taxes paid in 2010?Zero. $3.3 billion tax refund.

Amount of federal income taxes paid in 2009? Zero. $55 million tax refund.
14). Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs
Amount of federal income taxes Qualcomm would have owed if offshore tax havens were eliminated?$4.7 billion.
15). Tenneco CEO Gregg Sherill
Amount of federal income taxes Tenneco would have owed if offshore tax havens were eliminated?$269 million.
16). Express Scripts CEO George Paz
Amount of federal income taxes Express Scripts would have owed if offshore tax havens were eliminated?$20 million.
17). Caesars Entertainment CEO Gary Loveman
Amount of federal income taxes Caesars Entertainment would have owed if offshore tax havens were eliminated?$9 million.
Eighteen of the 80 CEOs who signed the call for deficit action are actually some of the biggest outsourcers and tax cheats in America. First, they crashed the economy in 2008. They followed that up by taking billions in taxpayer bailout dollars. Their next step was to outsource jobs and evade taxes. Now they are calling for action on a deficit that they helped create over the past four years.
Bernie Sandersis exposing the hypocrisy of these CEOs, and every American should understand that if Mitt Romney is elected president, these pigs see potential for unlimited feeding from the taxpayer trough. Only by standing together can we tell these CEOs that the bill has come due, and it is time for them to pay.
We can tell these gluttons of our dollars that the all you can eat taxpayer buffet is now closed.",1
"Mother Nature took a big bite out of the quarterly profits of billionaire Warren Buffett's sprawlingconglomerate.
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway can blame hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria for a nearly 44% decline in third-quarter profits, dragged down by about $3 billion in pre-tax storm-related losses in its insurance underwriting businesses.
Buffett's holdings in the insurance industry are sizable, and includeauto insurer Geico as well asre-insurers General Re and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Re-insurers provide coverage to other insurers, which take policiesout to minimize their own risk in the event they have massive claim payouts.
Berkshire's insurance underwriting business, which also took a hit from an earthquake in Mexico,suffered a loss of$1.44 billion amid a spike in insurance claims, vs. a profit of $272 million in the same period a year ago.In its quarterly filing to regulators, the company said it views pre-tax catastrophic losses of $100 million in a year as significant, ""and in the third quarter of 2017, we had four such events.""
Berkshire Hathaway's earnings results are closely watched on Wall Street because the company's businesses reach into virtually every corner of the U. S. economy.
Buffett, who has focused on buying ever-larger businesses as Berkshire has grown, now owns or has sizable stakes in well-known American companies and brands, such as Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, paint-maker Benjamin Moore, candy retailer See's Candies, Dairy Queen, battery-maker Duracell, homebuilder Clayton Homes and consumer products giant Kraft Heinz.
But the July-September quarter was all about the storm's bighit to its insurance business.
Berkshire reported third-quarter earnings of $4.07 billion, or $2,094 per share, falling well short of Wall Street analysts forecast of $2,402, according to earnings-tracker Thomson Reuters.
So far this year, Berkshire's ""A"" shares (BRK. A) have risen 14.9% to $280,470, which is less thanthe 15.6% return for the broad S&P 500 stock index.

Its Geico auto insurance unit suffered estimated losses of $500 million from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Flooding in Houston and Florida from the storms caused tens of thousands of cars to be totaled due to water damage, claims that auto insurer's like Geico are responsible for.
Other parts of Berkshirefared better. Burlington Northern Santa Fe, one of the largest railroad systems in North America, for example, posted a net earnings gain of 2.1%, boosted by revenue gains from hauling coal andconsumer and industrial products. Its utilities and energy operations grew revenue by more than 3%. Sales were also up at Duracell as well as Clayton Homes, which posted a 20% increase in quarterly revenue to $219 million due to higher home sales.
Despite the losses caused by natural disasters, Berkshire's tax hoard rose to $109 billion at the end of September, marking the first time it has crossed the $100 billion threshold.
Buffettis always on the lookout for big acquisitions, and his current hefty cash stash could give the billionaire investor even more flexibility in seeking his next big deal, says HardeepManku, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings.
""As the cash builds up, the expectation is it will be deployed at some point,"" says Manku, adding that he didn't want to speculate on what company or companies might be a good fit for Berkshire.
Buffett's most recent deal was back in October, when he took a nearly 40% stake in truck-stop chain Pilot Flying J in a deal that will make Berkshire Pilot Flying J's majority shareholder by acquiring another 40% of the company by 2023.",0
"Ordinarily, when you hear of a recall on a product it usually has to do with eggs, ice cream, or some other miscellaneous food product. But a recent report shows there has been a recall in pacemaker products. Considering the critical need required of pacemakers this could lead to seem very serious if not fatal results.
“Almost half a million people in the United States are highly recommended to get their pacemakers updated, as they are vulnerable to hacking. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recalled 465,000 pacemakers after discovering security flaws that could allow hackers to reprogram the devices to run the batteries down or even modify the patient’s heartbeat, potentially putting half a million patients lives at risk. A pacemaker is a small electrical battery-operated device that’s surgically implanted in the chest of patients to help control their heartbeats. The device uses low-energy electrical pulses to stimulate the heart to beat at a normal rate.
Six types of pacemakers, all manufactured by health-tech firm Abbott (formerly of St. Jude Medical) are affected by the recall, which includes the Accent, Anthem, Accent MRI, Accent ST, Assurity, and Allure. All the affected models are radio-frequency enabled cardiac devices—typically fitted to patients with irregular heartbeats and patients recovering from heart failure—and were manufactured before August 28th.
In May, researchers from security firm White Scope also analysed seven pacemaker products from four different vendors and discovered that pacemaker programmers could intercept the device using “commercially available” equipment that cost between $15 to $3,000.
“Many medical devices—including St. Jude Medical’s implantable cardiac pacemakers—contain configurable embedded computer systems that can be vulnerable to cybersecurity intrusions and exploits,” the FDA said in a security advisory. “As medical devices become increasingly interconnected via the Internet, hospital networks, other medical devices, and smartphones, there is an increased risk of exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, some of which could affect how a medical device operates.” To protect against these critical vulnerabilities, the pacemakers must be given a firmware update. The good news is that those affected by the recall do not require to have their pacemakers removed and replaced.”
The article also reported the following,
“Instead, patients with these implanted, vulnerable device must visit their healthcare provider to receive a firmware update—something that would take just 3 minutes or so to complete—that can fix the vulnerabilities.
In the U. S., the pacemaker devices to which the firmware update applies include Accent SR RF, Accent MRI, Assurity, Assurity MRI, Accent DR RF, Anthem RF, Allure RF, Allure Quadra RF, and Quadra Allure MP RF. Outside of the U.S., the pacemaker devices to which this update applies include Accent SR RF, Accent ST, Accent MRI, Accent ST MRI, Assurity, Assurity +, Assurity MRI, Accent DR RF, Anthem RF, Allure RF, Allure Quadra RF, Quadra Allure MP RF, Quadra Allure, and Quadra Allure MP.
As a result of the firmware update, any external device trying to communicate with the pacemaker will require authorization. Moreover, the software update also introduces data encryption, operating system fixes, the ability to disable network connectivity features, according to Abbott’s press release published on Tuesday, August 29. Any pacemaker device manufactured beginning August 28, 2017, will have the firmware update pre-installed and will not need the update. The FDA recall of devices does not apply to implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac resynchronization ICDs.
Abbott is working with the FDA, the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), global regulators, and leading independent security experts, in efforts to “strengthen protections against unauthorized access to its devices.” Although there are no reports of compromised pacemakers yet, the threat is enough to potentially harm heart patients with an implanted pacemaker that could even put their lives at great risk.
A recall of this size is a very serious problem and had it not been caught there could have been even more serious consequences. Especially given the fact this is a mechanical device and not just food. There needs to be more oversight for this type of problem.
One of the larger issues at hand lies in the trust that people have in connectivity and the technological product. If people don’t trust this product and feel it could be hacked at any time they will stop using it. But this is a lifesaving and necessary product and if not used properly could lead to fatalities. This is not the type of crisis of confidence that people can have. Otherwise, the consequences could be devastating.
The FDA should enhance the research they already do to ensure this type of problem doesn’t happen again. Whether it is done through increased funding or in increased regulatory authority something clearly needs to change. Because this type of result is completely unacceptable.
Share if you believe something needs to be done to increase oversight to ensure this doesn’t happen again!

"The Teamsters are trying to punish Big Pharma for flooding the country with prescription painkillers by hitting one of its top leaders where it hurts — in the eyes of shareholders.
The union has taken the unusual step of directly calling on McKesson Corp. shareholders to turn thumbs down on July 26 to the $1.1 million bonus that was awarded earlier this year to Chief Executive John Hammergren.
They say Hammergren, who heads the nation's largest pharmaceutical wholesaler, shouldn't have been rewarded after McKesson paid a record $150 million fine to the federal government this year for violating the Controlled Substances Act by failing to report suspicious orders of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills.
""It is not only a matter of poor optics,"" Ken Hall, general secretary and treasurer of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, wrote in a message to ""fellow"" McKesson shareholders. ""It is staggering that Hammergren received a $1.1 million boost to his bonus just months after the company announced it had reached a $150 million settlement"" with the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Besides the ""record fine by the DEA,"" Hall wrote, ""over the past year, McKesson has faced a rising tide of criticism that it failed to control the supply of prescription opioid in hard-hit states like West Virginia.""
""The company's sales practices have sparked a Congressional investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee as well as numerous pending lawsuits from cities and counties across the state,"" Hall wrote.
Michael Pryce-Jones, the Teamsters' senior corporate governance analyst, said it's too late to strip Hammergren of the money, ""but we can send a strong message to the board that it needs to rethink how they are paying their top executives.""
""This is a non-binding vote, and most votes on bonuses like this sail through with 95 percent support,"" Pryce-Jones told NBC News.
Anything less would be considered an embarrassment for Hammergren. ""This would be a vote of no confidence,"" Pryce-Jones said.
In its response, McKesson insisted that the company ""and its shareholders have been well served during John Hammergren's service as both CEO and chairman of the Board.""
""John's in-depth knowledge of the healthcare industry and of the complex businesses and operations of the company allows him to lead the Board's work and focus, ultimately helping deliver long-term value to our investors,"" the company said in a statement.
McKesson and other big pharmaceutical distributors, like AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc., have been accused of fueling the deadly opioid epidemic that has been ravaging the country. Many union members live in some of the states that have been hardest hit by the crisis — Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Michigan.
At the Teamsters convention last summer in Las Vegas, Travis Bornstein, who heads Local 24 in Akron, Ohio, moved many to tears as he described losing his son, Tyler, to drugs. And in April, Hall laid out the union's strategy for go after Hammergren in a harsh editorial.
""Amid the annals of corporate America, this must rank as one of the most tragic failures of corporate integrity — a devastating breakdown in values, culture, ethical conduct and regard for the law,"" he wrote.
There is no love lost between the Teamsters and McKesson. In 2014, a National Labor Relations Board judge ruled that McKesson had violated federal law by plotting to decertify a Teamsters local in Florida.
Bonus or no bonus, Hammergren isn't hurting for money. His base salary this year is $1,680,000, which has remained unchanged since May 2010, according to McKesson's 2017 stockholder report.
But Hammergren's total compensation is $20.1 million, making him one of the best-paid chief executives in the country. And with that kind of money, he could afford to take a bath on the palatial mansion in Orinda, California, that he's been trying to unload.
Hammergren put it on the market last year for $22.5 million, and the accompanying video shows a veritable palace with Ferraris parked in the four-car garage. It's still on the market for $16.5 million.
In a related matter, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department reached a $35 million settlement with Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals ""for failing to notify the DEA of suspicious drug orders, in large numbers.""
""These failures resulted in millions of oxycontin pills being sold on our streets,"" Session said at the annual convention of Drug Abuse Resistance Education, or D. A.R.E., in Grapevine, Texas.
Mallinckrodt confirmed the settlement in a statement but denied ""government allegations that it violated applicable laws in connection with its suspicious order monitoring program.""
""We chose to resolve the legacy matter in order to eliminate the uncertainty, distraction and expense of litigation and to allow the company to focus on meeting the important needs of its patients and customers,"" Mallinckrodt lawyer Michael-Bryant Hicks said in a statement.
Counterfeit Mallinckrodt oxycodone pills that are actually made from far more dangerous fentanyl have been flooding New England and were blamed for the death of a 30-year-old Hamden, Connecticut man, in March, according to the DEA.
Agustin Cirino, 29, who also lives in Hamden, was arrested a short time later and is the first person in the state to be hit with a federal charge of distributing fentanyl disguised as oxycodone, or Oxycontin, the feds said. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
""I can confirm it's the first case of its kind that we're prosecuting federally here in Connecticut,"" Tom Carson, a spokesman for the U. S. attorney's office in Hartford, told NBC News.",0

A court ruling filed by special counsel Robert Muller’s office showed that former Trump campaign head Paul Manafort keeps three U. S. passports with different ID numbers. Why? (Victoria Walker/TWP)     Onetime Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort keeps three U.S. passports with different identification numbers and submitted 10 passport applications in as many years, the office of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III disclosed in a new court filing Tuesday arguing that Manafort poses a significant flight risk. The 17-page filing came one day after Manafort and longtime business partner Rick Gates pleaded not guilty to an unsealed 12-count indictment alleging conspiracy to launder money, making false statements and other charges in connection with their work advising a Russia-friendly political party in Ukraine. In the first criminal allegations to come from probes into possible Russian influence in U.S. political affairs, prosecutors pressed their case against the two defendants, who face a hearing Thursday to set bail terms. A U.S. magistrate on Monday put the men on home confinement pending that hearing after Manafort, 68, pledged to pay a $10 million penalty and Gates a $5 million one if they failed to appear.  Prosecutors argued in the new filing that they “pose a risk of flight” based on a “history of deceptive and misleading conduct,” the evidence against them, and their wealth and foreign connections. The incentive to flee is even stronger “for a defendant such as Manafort, who is in his late 60s,” the government observed, noting that he faces a recommended sentence of about 12 to 15 years in prison if convicted, and Gates 10 to 12 years, not counting “related frauds.” In addition to noting Manafort’s unusual acquisition of numerous U.S. passports, “indicative of his travel schedule,” prosecutors Andrew Weissmann, Greg D. Andres and Kyle R. Freeny expanded on their argument Monday, citing the government’s difficulty in ascertaining Manafort’s wealth. “Manafort’s financial holdings are substantial, if difficult to quantify precisely because of his varying representations. ... The full extent of [his assets] is unclear,” they said. Manafort, for instance, reported $42 million in assets in March 2016; $136 million that May; and $28 million and $63million that August, in two separate financial applications, the government said. Gates listed his and his wife’s net worth as $30 million in a February 2016 application for a line of credit, but just $2.6 million in a March 2016 residential loan application. Prosecutors also saidthatManafort registered a phone and an email account underan alias in May and traveled with itto Mexico in June,to China on May 23 and to Ecuador on May 9. Manafort attorney Kevin Downing did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening, but told the court Monday that his client “definitely disagree[d]” with prosecutors using the “ valuation of assets that fluctuate greatly in different countries” to argue against his release. Separately, outside the courthouse, Downing said, “There is no evidence that Mr. Manafort and the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government.” Downing called “ridiculous” the charges, which he characterized as interpreting Manafort’s maintaining of offshore accounts as a means to bring his funds into the United States as a scheme to conceal assets. Gates’s temporary attorney, Assistant Federal Defender David Bos, declined to comment, saying Gates is arranging for new private counsel. The new court filing was disclosed after business hours after prosecutors asked — and the court ordered — that portions of the case be unsealed Tuesday.  U.S. Magistrate Deborah A. Robinson had granted prosecutors’ motion Friday to seal the entire case including the indictment and any warrants, and any other related matters, citing concern that disclosure could cause Manafort or Gates to flee or “to destroy (or tamper with) evidence.”  [Here is who is under investigation — and why]     U.S. judge bars Pentagon from blocking citizenship applications by immigrant recruits    Thirteen days in the history of the accused leader of the Benghazi attacks    ‘Peaches” was a mystery in a Supreme Court case over a D.

"HOUSTON --A Texas jury on Thursday found that a General Motors Co. ignition switch was not to blame for a 2011 accident that killed one driver and injured another, handing the carmaker its third courtroom win this year in a series of trials designed to help attorneys settle dozens of similar claims.
The jury deliberated less than two hours in reaching its verdict in a trial that began Aug. 9.
Zachary Stevens and his parents had sued GM, claiming a
faulty ignition switch in Stevens’ Saturn Sky jostled off, causing him to lose control of his car and hit another vehicle, killing its driver. Stevens’ attorneys say he suffered a traumatic brain injury and a skull fracture in the accident.
The switches can slip out of the on position, causing the cars to stall, knocking out power steering and turning off air bags. GM says it has fixed the problem.
Josh Davis, Stevens’ attorney, said that while his client never hid the fact that he was speeding before the accident, Stevens and his family still maintain the ignition switch was the main cause.
“It’s obviously very disappointing,” Davis said after the verdict. He had asked jurors to award the Stevens family more than $14.5 million.
Attorneys for GM told jurors in Houston the accident was caused by Stevens’ reckless speeding on a rain-slick road.
“As a result, an innocent man was killed. The accident had nothing to do with either General Motors or the ignition switch,” GM spokesman Jim Cain said in a statement after the verdict.
Stevens, who was 19 at the time, had been driving westbound on a road northeast of Houston near the town of New Caney when his car began to act erratically and he was unable to control it, according to his attorneys. Stevens’ car hit a guardrail and went into the eastbound lane, where it struck a vehicle driven by Mariano Landaverde, who died at the scene. Landaverde’s family had also been part of the lawsuit but settled out of court with GM.
In a videotaped deposition played for jurors earlier in the trial, GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said the automaker failed to designate the flawed ignition switch as a safety concern, instead misdiagnosing the problem as a customer satisfaction issue.
Stevens was charged with manslaughter, but a grand jury declined to indict and the charges were eventually dropped after GM began its recall related to the ignition switch.
In 2014, GM recalled 2.6 million older small cars worldwide to replace the faulty switches. Those included the Saturn Sky, as well as the Chevrolet Cobalt and others. GM also reviewed a backlog of safety problems and ordered a record 84 recalls that year covering more than 30 million vehicles, including 27 million in the U. S.
GM won two other ignition cases tried earlier this year.
In January, a trial in New York ended abruptly after the judge raised questions about the plaintiff’s truthfulness. In March, a New York jury found that an ignition switch was not to blame in a 2014 accident on an icy New Orleans bridge.
These cases have been part of a series of bellwether trials that are testing the legal boundaries of hundreds of claims remaining against GM.
In September, GM announced it had settled 1,385 death and injury cases for $275 million and a class-action shareholders’ lawsuit for $300 million.
The company paid nearly $600 million to settle 399 claims made to a fund it established. Those claims covered 124 deaths and 275 injuries. GM’s fund rejected more than 90 percent of the 4,343 claims it received, according to figures the company released in December.
After Thursday’s verdict, several jurors said that while they were upset about GM’s failure to let consumers know about the ignition switch problems sooner, they didn’t see any proof in this case that the switch was at fault.
“I held my nose and I did my job,” said Walter Kimble, 58, one of the jurors. “I wanted so desperately to make that young man a millionaire, but they didn’t give me anything I could work with.”",0
"We've all heard the statistics. Your chances of winning the Powerball jackpot are about one in 175.2 million. You're more likely to die from a bee sting (one in 6.1 million), be struck by lightning (one in 3 million) or have conjoined twins (one in 200,000).
But people keep playing -- most likely because the thought of winning is much more fun than the thought of being attacked by a shark (one in 11.5 million).
""It doesn't faze them because they're in love with hope,"" Walsh said.
Why we play the Powerball
For the 2012 fiscal year, U.S. lottery sales totaled $78 billion, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. More than half of us have played the lottery in the last year, although 20% of customers buy the majority of the tickets.
Part of the allure is that everyone else is doing it, said Dr. Stephen Goldbart, author of ""Affluence Intelligence"" and co-director of the Money, Meaning & Choices Institute.
In a Psychology Today article titled ""Lottery-itis!"" Goldbart noted two main reasons why people buy tickets.
""Jumping on the bandwagon is an age-old motivator of psychological behavior,"" wrote Goldbart and his colleague, Joan DiFuria. ""We want to be with the in-crowd, to be 'part of the movement,' not 'feel left out.' ""
The second reason stems from a sense of disempowerment that comes with change -- whether it's a changing economy or a changing world.
""The map to finding the American Dream has been radically altered,"" they wrote. ""(The lottery) lets you believe in magic: that you will be the one who spent a little and got a lot; that you will defy the extraordinary odds against winning.""
Spend a little, get a lot -- the basis for every good investment. The low cost of a lottery ticket is one of the most seductive things about it.
The lottery industry is often criticized for being an unfair tax on the poor. On average, households that make less than $12,400 a year spend 5% of their income on lotteries, according to Wired.

Powerball winner quit her job 'automatically' 01:04
In 2008, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University attempted to explain why the poor are more likely to buy lottery tickets.
The study, published in the Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, theorized that people focus on the cost-to-benefit ratio of a single ticket rather than add up the long-term cost of playing over a year, or a lifetime.
Some study participants were given $1 at a time and asked if they wanted to spend each dollar on a lottery ticket, author George Loewenstein said. Others were given $5 and asked how many tickets they wanted to buy with the money. Members of a third group were told they could either spend $5 on lottery tickets or buy none at all.
People in the second group bought half as many as those given $1 at a time. In the all-or-nothing scenario, 87% of the study participants purchased zero tickets. The researchers' findings were consistent with something known as the ""peanuts effect.""
""There are money amounts that are small enough that people almost ignore them,"" Loewenstein said Wednesday.
""It almost doesn't feel real. The lottery and penny slots are kind of the sweet spot of risk taking. They're really cheap, really inexpensive to play, but there's a big possible upside.""
Still, to say that playing the lottery is a bad idea doesn't sit well with the professor of economics and psychology.
""It's ridiculous to say that 51% of the population is just irrational or self-destructive,"" he said. ""It serves a psychological function for people. ... Our pleasure of living is not only based on our current situation, but what could be, what we can imagine our situation could become.""
Irrational or not, millions will sit around their TV and computer screens, praying that the six numbers they're clutching will appear.
They're optimistic that the fairy-tale ending they've been waiting for will come, even if it takes a little magic.",0
"Is Fukushima the greatest environmental disaster of all time? Every single day, 300 tons of radioactive water from Fukushima enters the Pacific Ocean. The radioactive material that is being released will outlive all of us by a very wide margin, and it is constantly building up in the food chain. Nobody knows for sure how many people will eventually develop cancer and other health problems as a result of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, but some experts are not afraid to use the word “billions”. It has been well over two years since the original disaster, and now they are telling us that it could take up to 40 more years to clean it up. It is a nightmare of unimaginable proportions, and there is nowhere in the northern hemisphere that you will be able to hide from it. The following are 11 facts about the ongoing Fukushima nuclear holocaust that are almost too horrifying to believe…
#1It is estimated that there are1,331 used nuclear fuel rodsthat need to be removed from Fukushima. Because of all of the damage that has taken place, computer-guided removal of the rods will not be possible. Manual removal is much riskier, and it is absolutely essential that the removal of each of the 1,331 rods goes perfectly because a single mistake could potentially lead toa nuclear chain reaction.
#2Accordingto Reuters, the combined amount of cesium-137 contained in those nuclear fuel rods is 14,000 times greater than what was released when the U. S. dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima at the end of World War II. Other estimates put this number far higher.
#3Officials in Japan admit that300 tonsof radioactive water from Fukushima is entering the Pacific Ocean every 24 hours.
#4According to a professor at Tokyo University,3 gigabecquerelsof cesium-137 are flowing into the port at Fukushima Daiichievery single day…
Yoichiro Tateiwa, NHK reporter: [Professor Jota] Kanda argues government statistics don’t add up. He says a daily leakage of 300 tons doesn’t explain the current levels of radiation in the water.
Jota Kanda, Tokyo University professor: According to my research there are now 3 gigabecquerels [3 billion becquerels] of cesium-137 flowing into the port at Fukushima Daiichi every day. But for the 300 tons of groundwater to contain this much cesium-137, one liter of groundwater has to contain 10,000 becquerels of the radioactive isotope.
NHK: Kanda’s research and monitoring by Tepco puts the amount of cesium-137 in the groundwater around the plant at several hundred becquerels per liter at most. He’s concluded that radioactive isotope is finding another way to get into the ocean. He’s calling on the government and Tepco to identify contamination routes other than groundwater.
#5According to Tepco, a total of somewhere between20 trillion and 40 trillion becquerels of radioactive tritiumhave gotten into the Pacific Ocean since the Fukushima disaster first began.
#6Something is causing fish along the west coast of Canadato bleed from their gills, bellies and eyeballs. Could Fukushima be responsible?
#7150 former sailors and Marines say that they now have radiation sickness as a result of serving on U. S. Navy ships near Fukushima and they aresuing for damages.
#8The Iodine-131, Cesium-137 and Strontium-90 that are constantly coming from Fukushima are going to affect the health of those living the the northern hemisphere for a very, very long time. Just check out whatHarvey Wassermanhad to say recently…
Iodine-131, for example, can be ingested into the thyroid, where it emits beta particles (electrons) that damage tissue. A plague of damaged thyroids has already been reported among as many as 40 percent of the children in the Fukushima area. That percentage can only go higher. In developing youngsters, it can stunt both physical and mental growth. Among adults it causes a very wide range of ancillary ailments, including cancer.
Cesium-137 from Fukushima has been found in fish caught as far away as California. It spreads throughout the body, but tends to accumulate in the muscles.
Strontium-90’s half-life is around 29 years. It mimics calcium and goes to our bones.
#9It is believed that the Fukushima nuclear facility originally contained a whopping1760 tons of nuclear material.
#10It is being projected that the entire Pacific Ocean will soon “have cesium levels 5 to 10 times higher” than what we witnessed during the era of heavy atomic bomb testing in the Pacific many decades ago.
#11According to the Wall Street Journal, it is being projected that the cleanup of Fukushima could takeup to 40 years to complete.
Sadly, the true horror of this disaster is only starting to be understood, and most people have absolutely no idea how serious all of this is. What fallout researcher Christina Consolotold RT the other dayshould be very sobering for all of us…
We have endless releases into the Pacific Ocean that will be ongoing for not only our lifetimes, but our children’s’ lifetimes. We have 40 million people living in the Tokyo area nearby. We have continued releases from the underground corium that reminds us it is there occasionally with steam events and huge increases in radiation levels. Across the Pacific, we have at least two peer-reviewed scientific studies so far that have already provided evidence of increased mortality in North America, and thyroid problems in infants on the west coast states from our initial exposures.
We have increasing contamination of the food chain, through bioaccumulation and biomagnification. And a newly stated concern is the proximity of melted fuel in relation to the Tokyo aquifer that extends under the plant. If and when the corium reaches the Tokyo aquifer, serious and expedient discussions will have to take place about evacuating 40 million people from the greater metropolitan area. As impossible as this sounds, you cannot live in an area which does not have access to safe water.
The operation to begin removing fuel from such a severely damaged pool has never been attempted before. The rods are unwieldy and very heavy, each one weighing two-thirds of a ton. But it has to be done, unless there is some way to encase the entire building in concrete with the pool as it is. I don’t know of anyone discussing that option, but it would seem much ‘safer’ than what they are about to attempt…but not without its own set of risks.
And all this collateral damage will continue for decades, if not centuries, even if things stay exactly the way they are now. But that is unlikely, as bad things happen like natural disasters and deterioration with time…earthquakes, subsidence, and corrosion, to name a few. Every day that goes by, the statistical risk increases for this apocalyptic scenario. No one can say or know how this will play out, except that millions of people will probably die even if things stay exactly as they are, and billions could die if things get any worse.
The area immediately around Fukushima is already permanently uninhabitable, and the truth is that a much wider area of northern Japan should probably be declared off limits for human habitation.
But this just isn’t about Japan. The cold, hard reality of the matter is that this is truly a disaster that is planetary in scope. The nuclear material from Fukushima is going to be carried all over the northern hemisphere, and countless numbers of people are going to become seriously ill as a result.
And remember, this is a disaster that is not even close to being contained yet. Hundreds of tons of radioactive water continues to enter the Pacific Ocean every single day making the disaster that we are facing even worse.
May God have mercy on us all.",1
"And the habitual kook that is Alex Jones from Info Wars is once again right! And no, this time it’s not about our tap water making frogs gay or anything of the sort. The UN has once again been proven to be working against the free world and our Judeo/Christian values.
A very interesting document was found on the globalist United Nations’ website last week. The document tells about how the only way the western world will be able to replenish its aging workforce is by bringing in dirty Muslim Refugees. The document is written on an official letterhead from the Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division and it lays out the substance and goal of the so-called study which is titled, “Replacement Migration: Is It a Solution to Declining and Ageing Populations?”
Replacement Migration:
Is It a Solution to Declining and Ageing Populations?
United Nations projections indicate that over the next 50 years, the populations of virtually all countries of Europe as well as Japan will face population decline and population ageing. The new challenges of declining and ageing populations will require comprehensive reassessments of many established policies and programmes, including those relating to international migration.
Focusing on these two striking and critical population trends, the report considers replacement migration for eight low-fertility countries (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United Kingdom and United States) and two regions (Europe and the European Union). Replacement migration refers to the international migration that a country would need to offset population decline and population ageing resulting from low fertility and mortality rates.
It’s not a surprise to any of us at this point in time that the United Nations is working against us freedom loving people. We have been seeing it for years now. The moment the UN thought it would be a good idea to install the nations of China and Cuba to the human rights council it became very clear what their true goal really is. My question is, why the United States still part of this crap and why are we funding it? The whole organization should move itself to the Middle East since they like those people so much.
The U. N. Population Fund, which has seen all funding cut by the Trump administration, says donors have committed $207 million to help expand family planning services and strengthen national health programs.
But the agency, known as UNFPA, says it still needs $700 million for contraceptives and other family planning supplies for 2017-2020.
International donors made the pledges Tuesday at a Family Planning Summit in London but the total wasn’t announced until late Thursday.
The agency’s acting executive director Natalia Kanem said in a statement that family planning is “one of the smartest investments” for countries because it allows women to choose whether or when to have children.
“They can stay in school longer, earn a degree and enter the workforce, ultimately making families, communities and nations thrive,” she said.
UNFPA said Friday it was allocated about $69 million for 2016 from the United States, including about $31 million for its overall budget and the remainder earmarked for specific programs. It received $75 million from the U.S. in 2015.
But the Trump administration announced in April it was cutting all funding to the population fund, following through on campaign promises by President Donald Trump to let socially conservative policies determine the way the U.S. government operates and conducts itself in the world.
Even though UNFPA does not support or provide abortions, the cut was widely viewed as a gesture to anti-abortion advocates and other conservative interests.
The agency said $132.9 million of the funding pledged Tuesday will support its core budget, including enabling it to tackle emergencies quickly and provide sexual and reproductive health services to women and girls caught in humanitarian crises.
Another $74.1 million will be invested in UNFPA Supplies, a program which currently provides over 40 percent of donated contraceptives worldwide, reaching about 20 million women and young people each year.
In 2016 alone, contraceptives provided by UNFPA Supplies helped avert about 7.1 million unintended pregnancies, 20,000 maternal deaths and 126,000 child deaths, the agency said.
Arthur Erken, UNFPA’s director of communications and strategic partnerships, said Friday that “while we still have a considerable gap in funding, it was a major step in the right direction, with developing countries stepping up to the plate.”
But he said without the $700 million needed for 2017 to 2020 the UNFPA Supplies program “could be forced to cut services, which will reduce the number of women and girls it can serve.”
Nice to see the UN finally having to beg for money from other sources to fund their Globalist agenda. Under President Donald Trump we Americans are no longer the world’s piggy bank. Plus there is no need for us to fund an organization which is located on our soil but hates everything we and the land of Israel stand for.
Enough with the United Nations and their blatant anti-Americanism and Anti-Semitism. Leave already!
Please share if you want the United Nations out of the U. S. soil….

"Republican tax reform could drastically and irreparably transform 401(k) and other workplace retirement plans.
In the name of tax reform, Republicans are considering changes to employer-sponsored retirement plans that could seriously derail the effort to get people to save for old age.
Many companies have already gotten rid of pensions or reduced their payouts. Social Security funding is a hot mess.
And so what does the ruling party want to do?
It wants to balance their tax cuts for businesses and wealthy Americans by possibly limiting the maximum pre-tax amount that individuals and married couples could contribute to workplace saving plans such as the 401(k) and federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan.

Although no details have come out yet, media reports say Republicans are considering limiting the pre-tax contributions to $2,400 a year, a considerable reduction from the current limit of $18,000. (It goes up by $500 next year.) If you’re over 50, the maximum is $24,000.

But by Wednesday, Trump was already backtracking on that promise. I guess all caps don’t mean what they use to.

Of course financial services companies are siding with consumers on this issue.
I don’t now about you, but the overwhelming majority of my retirement savings has been done through my workplace 401(k) plan. It is my safety net. Drastically lowering the contribution levels could drive a lot of people away from the plans.

— From NerdWallet: Yes, You Need a 401(k) in Your 20s — Here’s Why
But there are critics of the plans:
— Self-made millionaire says don’t put money in your 401(k)
“The 401(k) is merely where you kiss your money away for 40 years hoping it grows up. Rather than focusing on saving, focus on earning — you can’t save your way to millionaire status,” Grant Cardone, author of “Be Obsessed Or Be Average,” told CNBC.

As CNBC Sharon Epperson wrote: “The number of workers who have $1 million or more saved in 401(k) or other workplace retirement plans provided by Fidelity Investments nearly doubled from 2012 to 2014, according to the firm. In a separate study, Fidelity analyzed over 5,500 plan participants who made less than $150,000 a year, yet had amassed over $1 million in 401(k) assets by the end of 2012.”

How much does it take to be wealthy?
Charles Schwab did a national survey to see how much it would take for people to consider themselves rich. Survey participants on average said they’d need $2.4 million to be considered wealthy.So last week I asked: “How much do you think it takes to be rich?”
James wrote, “My definition of ‘wealthy’ is having enough money not to have to worry about money. Whatever makes you comfortable and worry free is the true definition of wealth. A dollar amount for me would be $2 million.”
T. C. of Orlando, Florida had a long answer, but it’s worth reading:
“My wife and I are both 70,” he said. “We both grew up in families with very limited means. We’d had to work for everything we have. My wife retired at age 62 when her company was absorbed by another firm. I retired in 2012 (age 65) after 43 years with the same Fortune 50 employer with a pension (with 50% survivor benefits) and some level of tax-free money for retiree medical benefits. Prior to retirement we had been working with a financial adviser who put in place a retirement plan. We were living, and continue to live, debt free. We structured our portfolio with diversified investments, with both qualified, non-qualified accounts and cash. Each of us has an annuity, and I have fully paid up life insurance. We also have a joint long term care policy that has been in place since 2006 . Two years prior to my retirement we put in place a budget with very detailed income to actual expense detail. We have carried this tracking into retirement and adjust the budget, as needed, at the end of each year to forecast our next year expenses vs. expected income.
He goes on to write: “My wife started collecting social security at age 62 shortly after she retired. We know this was not a good financial move due to the Social Security benefit reduction, but it was the ‘right’ decision to give her the sense that she replaced some of her earnings. I started taking spousal benefits on her record at my age 66. I was the higher earner and I started taking my Social Security benefits on my record at age 70. We are in generally good health and well covered with our original Medicare, a Medigap plan and a Part D plan. We had been aggressive savers when working, educated two our children and seeded our grandchildren’s 529 plans. To date, we have been living on my pension, and our Social Security benefits and still putting away some of our fixed retirement income into our retirement accounts. We have been able to maintain our pre work life style without any compromises, since we always lived below our means (a legacy of our formative years). We will have to start taking required minimum distributions from our respective traditional IRAs in 2018. This will be the first time we take money out of any retirement account. We will reinvest the proceeds that are not consumed by taxes.
And my question: “We are already ‘rich’ in a sense as described above. Our concerns living in retirement, excluding calamitous events completely out of our control, are our health as we age, health care costs, inflation and taxes. These are the unknowns. The Forbes average of $2.4 million would make us feel ‘richer’ in that it would allow us to absorb within reason these unknowns, continue to live well, contribute generously to charities, and leave a legacy to our children and grandchildren to a greater extent than we can today.”
In this couple’s answer is a lot of what it takes to save enough to live well in retirement.

"After the state of Ohio found that voting machines in more than a dozen counties had been tampered with, they tied them directly to the George Soros Corporation. It took the Federal Election Commission less than an hour to get an indictment through the US Attorney after that. In under three hours total, George Soros was photographed sitting in a courtroom waiting to be arraigned.
Soros faces charges of election tampering, wire fraud, electronics fraud and perjury — as well as several smaller charges of inciting violence and harassment — after accounting books found in his office prove he personally paid the Berkely protestors as well as the group of liberal trolls that “goated” 26 conservative Facebook pages in 2014.
If convicted, Soros could face 30 years in prison and fines up to $40 million. He also runs the risk of having his citizenship revoked and being deported to his home country of Hungary. He was released on $2 million bail.
The prosecutor said this is just the beginning of the case against Soros and that it could go right up the rungs of the democratic party, possibly all the way to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The investigation is ongoing, but he says there is plenty of evidence to try and convict Soros on the charges he already faces.",1
"Results from a new study concluded that millions of non-citizens could have voted in the 2008 presidential election, suggesting that President Donald Trump’s claim that more than 3 million illegal alien voters cost him the popular vote in November might be accurate.
After reviewing post-election polling data, New Jersey research group Just Facts announced that the number of non-citizens voting illegally is considerably more than previous estimates, the Washington Times reported.
In fact, as many as 5.7 million non-citizens may have voted in the 2008 election that gave Barack Obama his first term in the White House.
Just Facts, a non-profit research and educational institute, estimated that as many as 7.9 million non-citizens illegally registered in 2008 and somewhere between 594,000 to 5.7 million actually voted in that year’s presidential election.
So much for Democrats’ claim that voter fraud doesn’t exist.
Oddly enough, these numbers are in line with Trump’s claim about what might have happened in 2016. Trump, who faced merciless ridicule for his claim that millions of illegal-alien voters cost him the nationwide popular vote last November, might have been closer to the truth that even he realized.
If it turns out that Trump was right, then what we have at the heart of this study is the betrayal of every American voter. Because every vote cast illegally can nullify a vote cast by an American citizen, and dilute the entire electoral process.
A system that allows it is betraying American democracy, and every voter should be furious about it.
In May, Trump signed an executive orderthat established a commission to investigatevoter fraud. ThePresidential Commission on Election Integrity will review Trump’s allegations as well as “systemic issues that have been raised over many years in terms of the integrity of the elections.”
There’s no telling what the commission will find, but if it reports that our voting system is indeed as broken as these numbers suggest, then we need to know so we can begin the process of fixing it. CONSERVATIVE TRIBUNE",1
"Roku has a newlineup of streaming video players coming as it aims to maintain its lead over competitors Amazon, Google and Apple.
Among the new products: a $29.99 player, a new $69.99 streaming stick with improved wireless connectivity and its top-of-the-line Ultra player ($99.99), which delivers 4K high dynamic range (HDR) video.
The streaming video marketplace is set to heat up this month with new products from most of the main players. Amazon last week unveiled its new Amazon Fire TV, whileApple announced its new Apple TV player, its first able to stream 4K video. Current players from Amazon and Roku, along with Google's Chromecast Ultra, already handle 4K.

 More: Watch out, Apple: Amazon announces new $99, Alexa-powered Echo
eMarketer estimates that 38.9 million Americans will use a Roku device at least once a month, up 19.3% from 2016. As a result, the device will capture 23.1% of all connected TV users. Google Chromecast (37 million) and Amazon Fire TV (36 million) are close behind; Apple TV (21 million) trails the field.
The newest products from the Los Gatos, Calif.-based tech company, available for pre-order now and out Oct. 8, aim to capture not only longtime cord cutters but newcomers to the streaming marketplace — you connect the device to your TV and your home Internet network to get video from Netflix, YouTube and other video apps.
The Roku Ultra ($99.99) has a built-in ethernet port and micro SD slot for those who use lots of apps. In addition to handling 4K and 4K HDR video, the Ultra has a new voice-powered remote that can turn your TV on and change the volume, and let you plug in headphones for late-night viewing.
The Roku Streaming Stick ($49.99) streams HD video and also has a voice remote, while the Streaming Stick+ ($69.99) adds 4K and 4K HDR video and an advanced wireless receiver built into its power cord for a 4X boost in its wireless range.
For entry-level consumers, the Roku Express ($29.99) handles high-def video and the Roku Express+ ($39.99, available only at Walmart) comes with composite video cables (red/yellow/white jacks) for older TVs.
A new Roku operating system, coming later this month to Roku players and next month to Roku TVs, includes a smart guide that incorporates over-the-air broadcast programming -- you need an antenna connected to your Roku TV -- and a new Roku channel with free ad-supported movies and TV content.
Advertising revenue was cited in the company's IPO filing last month as one of the paths to profitability.The company reported revenue of $399 million in 2016 and a loss of $42.3 million.
The streaming company has licensed movies from studios such as Lionsgate, MGM, and Sony for its Roku channel and have reduced the ads to about half what you would normally see on typical ad-supported TV broadcasts. ""What we really see is people are hungry for free TV and this is a way to get it with no subscriptions and no fees or no log-ins and it is available across the Roku platform,"" said Roku's chief marketing officerMatthew Anderson.",0
"Roughly 2 million foreigners will get temporary work permits, dubbed “Employment Authorization Documents,” or EADS, during 2017, despite administration efforts to cut back some of the many business-backed foreign-worker programs, according totwo setsofdatareleasedby the Department of Homeland Security.
“This is almost entirely outside of our legal immigration and legal guest-worker system — these are additional workers,” said Jessica Vaughan, a policy expert at the Center for Immigration Studies. “Themajority of these [EAD] work permits are given to people who originally entered the country illegally and now have some kind of exception being made for them, either on a temporarybase or while they apply for some other benefit,” she added.
The new data shows that 1.6 million work-permit EADs were given out during the first nine months of the government’s 2017 accounts. That puts the number on track to break 2 million, partly because an extra rush of people applied for DACA amnesty work permits in September and early October.
Four million young Americans join the workforce each year. But their ability to get well-paid jobs is hurt by the one-for-one influx of roughly four million lower-wage foreign workers.
As the newreportshow, roughly2 million foreigners will get EADs in 2017. Also, 1 million foreigners are allowed to become legal immigrants. Roughly half a millionforeign “guest workers” get work-visas, such as the H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, J-1 and L-1 visas, and a few hundred thousand illegal immigrants will cross the Mexican border or overstay the temporary tourist or work visas. That inflow adds up to almost 4 million, or one new migrant for every American who turns 18.
“There’s no way you can make the case that this number of work permits being issued annually does not have an affect on the labor market,” Vaughan said.
A huge population of roughly 30 million lower-wage immigrants has filled up job openings since the 1970s, leaving millions of American men unwilling or unable to work. In 1980, 94 percent of prime-age U. S.-born men were working, according tofederal data.

“Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!” he said tweet.
Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!
As Nielsen data gathered by Bloomberg, Trump’s ratings went below those for the first inaugurations of former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama.
Obama’s 2009 inauguration had 7 million more viewers, as reported the news outlet, while more than 11 million people watched Reagan be sworn into office in 1981.
Trump on Saturday told the truth in the media’s face, and showed the relevant calculations of the crowd present at the inauguration. “Honestly it looked like a million and half people, whatever it was it was. But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument … and by mistake I get this network and it showed an empty field, and it said we drew 250,000 people. Now that’s not bad, but it’s a lie,” Trump stated at a visit to CIA headquarters.
The spokesman of Trump later slammed the news organizations aim on the inaugural crowd bigness as “shameful and wrong.”
“This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Sean Spicer stated at the time of his first official showing in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room.",1
"China is ‘ready’ to declare war on America if they dare to attack North Korea, the Chinese government warned on Thursday.
According to the state-run Global Times, China will use ‘all necessary force’ against the U. S. military to prevent them from carrying out strikes against North Korea and overthrowing Kim Jong-un.
Rt.com reports: Beijing should make it clear that“if North Korea launches missiles that threaten US soil first and the US retaliates, China will stay neutral,”theGlobal Timeswrote.
But if the US and its ally South Korea take on Pyongyang and try to“overthrow the North Korean regime and change the political pattern of the Korean Peninsula, China will prevent them from doing so,”the paper stressed.
The widely-quoted newspaper, published by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, also noted that the latest developments are seen in Beijing with growing frustration and deep concern.
“If war really breaks out, the US can hardly reap any strategic harvest and North Korea will face unprecedented risks,”the paper cautioned.“North Korea aims to propel the US to negotiate with it, while the US wants to put North Korea in check.”
Beijing was unable“to persuade Washington or Pyongyang to back down at this time,”the Global Times said, adding it primarily pursues peace and stability in the region. All sides involved in the crisis should understand that“when their actions jeopardize China’s interests, China will respond with a firm hand,”the government paper explained.
China – North Korea’s long-standing economic partner and ideological ally – reiterated on Friday that all sides involved in the crisis must“speak and act with caution”as well as build up trust rather than“taking turns in shows of strength,”according to a Foreign Ministry statement quoted by Reuters.
Earlier in the week, US President Donald Trump added more fuel to the North Korean crisis, saying that his previous threat to unleash“fire and fury which the world has never seen”was perhaps not“tough enough.”
Speaking on Thursday at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump said the North Koreans“better get their act together or they’re going to be in trouble like few nations ever have been in trouble in this world.”The open threat from Washington came after Pyongyang ridiculed Trump’s“fire and fury”remark as a“load of nonsense.”
Pyongyang also announced that a detailed plan to launch missiles against the US Pacific airbase on Guam will be completed soon. In response, the US military signaled it could dispatch strategic B-1 bombers to target North Korea’s missile launch sites, underground facilities and other installations.
Such a“reckless game”may result in dire consequences, the Global Times said. “Neither Washington nor Pyongyang really wants war, but a war could break out anyway as they do not have the experience of putting such an extreme game under control.”
The stakes are extremely high as both sides seem ready for worst-case scenarios, according to respected Russian observers. Pavel Zolotarev, a retired Russian major general, told RT that decision-making in Washington goes“beyond rational logic, and … we can have consequences that are hard to foresee.”
“Every country’s military has to elaborate deployment strategies for any eventuality. It is politicians – not the military – who decide on whether or not to use such plans… So, if the North Korean military talks of such plans, it means it actually has them,”he said, commenting on Pyongyang’s threat to target Guam.
“The North Korean military may inflict significant damage to US forces during a conventional conflict. Though their equipment is far behind the American assets, their combat readiness and military morale are much higher,”the retired general said.",1
"On Tuesday, February 7, 2017, if you were in an auditorium at Georgetown University, you would have heard something that should have made your skin crawl. A professor, Dr. Jonathan Brown, a Georgetown Professor of Islamic Studies, says slavery and non-consensual sex is just alright in the world of Islam. Mind you, he said this in SUPPORT of Islam. As in he’s actually fine with slavery and non-consensual sex (real rape), and is using Islam to shelter his beliefs. This man is teaching at Georgetown. Got that?
This professor is indoctrinating, he is NOT educating. He is one of the useful idiots that are so necessary to foist a disgusting culture on young, impressionable, people…and they are swallowing it, hook, line, and sinker, because they don’t know any better and haven’t the guts or intelligence to do due diligence to find out the truth. He is teaching his students that men do not need consent to have sex with women, and that slavery is justifiable under Islamic teachings. Brown stated that slaves were “protected by Sharia,” omitting the various atrocities committed by slave-owners. Girls and women were forced into the sex trade and their male counterparts were often castrated.
The history of slavery spans nearly every culture, nationality, and religion and from ancient times to the present day. However, the social, economic, and legal positions of slaves were vastly different in different systems of slavery in different times and places. Although slavery is no longer legal anywhere in the world, human trafficking remains an international problem and an estimated 25-40 million people are living in illegal slavery today.
The professor stated that “Consent isn’t necessary for lawful sex,” and defined consent as a Western concept. If “Western” translates to “civilized”, I will go on record as saying that “consent” is absolutely necessary, and if the woman says “No.”, that’s it. Although Slavery in Mauritania was criminalized in August 2007, in Mauritania it is estimated that up to 600,000 men, women and children, or 20% of the population, are currently enslaved, many of them used as bonded labor.
Unfortunately, even hearing this said at a “prestigious” university isn’t shocking either. It seems to be part of a grand plan, using stealth jihad, to get the next generation(s) to accept something that is actually repugnant to them…if they would take the time and effort to think about it.
In Sierra Leone in the 19th century about half of the population consisted of slaves. The Anti-Slavery Society estimated that there were 2,000,000 slaves in the early 1930s Ethiopia, out of an estimated population of between 8 and 16 million. Slavery in northern Nigeria was finally outlawed in 1936…but, wait a minute, isn’t that where Boko Haram kidnapped over 200 school girls and sold many of them into slavery? Yeah, I believe that’s the place.
The African continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes. Across the Sahara, through the Red Sea, from the Indian Ocean ports and across the Atlantic. At least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the Muslim countries (from the ninth to the nineteenth).
Four million slaves exported via the Red Sea, another four million through the Swahili ports of the Indian Ocean, perhaps as many as nine million along the trans-Saharan caravan route, and eleven to twenty million, depending on the author, across the Atlantic Ocean.
It is plain to me that slavery still exists. It is also plain to me that Islamic-controlled countries are doing the bulk of enslaving the peoples. African states played a key role in the slave trade. Slavery was already a common practice among Sub Saharan Africans long before the involvement of the Arabs, and the Berbers. I believe it has grown under those groups. Selling captives or prisoners was common practice among Africans, Turks, Berbers and Arabs during that era. There has also been speculation that within Africa, females were most often captured as brides, with their male protectors being a “bycatch” who would have been killed if there had not been an export market for them.
All in all, Professor Brown is presenting a horrible practice as something that is permissible. In my research, Islam was started by a pedophile warlord who wrote down things that he liked to do, and told his followers that those were the words of Allah. Because Islam condones very nearly everything that Western civilization abhors, it’s easy to gain converts…a good example is the conversion of many in prison. They recognize that, by claiming it’s their religion, they can commit heinous crimes and may get away with it, because it’s written in their holy book.
Parting shot: I believe that Islam is a cult, not a religion. I would not trust any Muslim as far as I could throw a Buick. That makes me insensitive, hard-hearted, stupid…or whatever else you want to throw at me. It doesn’t mean anything to me. Anyone can follow whatever leader they want to, but don’t expect me to join in if it’s something so repulsive it back to medieval torture processes.
Share if you think rape and slavery are wrong always and everywhere, period!",1

"A Russian jet was scrambled to fight a ‘rogue’ US fighter jet which was attempting to protect an ISIS base to the west of the Euphrates river on Nov. 23.
The Russian interceptor chased the US jet from actively interfering in a Russian anti-ISIS operation, the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed.
Zerohedge.com reports: The ministry’s spokesman,Major General Igor Konashenkov described the episode as yet another example of the US air force attempting to prevent Russian forces from carrying out strikes against Islamic State.
“An American F-22 fighter actively prevented the Russian pair of Su-25 attack aircraft from carrying out a combat mission to destroy the Daesh stronghold in the suburbs of the city of Mayadin in the airspace over the western bank of the Euphrates River on November 23. The F-22 aircraft fired off heat flares and released brake shields with permanent maneuvering, imitating an air battle,” Konashenkov said on Saturday.
“The F-22 launched decoy flares and used airbrakes while constantly maneuvering [near the Russian strike jets], imitating an air fight,” Konashenkov added that the US jet backed down only after a Russian Su-35S fighter jet joined the two Su-25s
The major general went on to say that “most close-midair encounters between Russian and US jets in the area around the Euphrates River have been linked to the attempts of US aircraft to get in the way [of the Russian warplanes] striking against Islamic State terrorists.”
He also said that the US military officials provided no explanation for the November 23 incident as well as other, similar encounters.
The statement came as a response to the Pentagon’s claims about “an increase in unsafe behavior” by Russian warplanes.“We saw anywhere from six to eight incidents daily in late November, where Russian or Syrian aircraft crossed into our airspace on the east side of the Euphrates River,”Lt. Col. Damien, the spokesman for US Air Force Central Command, told CNN earlier on Saturday.
Even though ISIS has effectively been driven out of Syria, last month Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signaled that the US is preparing for an interminable period of occupation after he told reporters at the Pentagon that the US is preparing for a long-term military commitment in Syria to fight ISIS “as long as they want to fight.”At the time,Mattis indicated that even should ISIS lose all of its territory there would still be a dangerous insurgency that could morph into an “ISIS 2.0” which he said the US would seek to prevent. “The enemy hasn’t declared that they’re done with the area yet, so we’ll keep fighting as long as they want to fight,” Mattis said. “We’re not just going to walk away right now before the Geneva process has traction.”
Russia has blasted the US for its illegal air force presence in Syria, asSputnik noted. And as Pickart explained, the majority of near-misses between US and Russian planes in Syria and in the area of the Euphrates were connected with the Washington’s attempts to hinder Daesh’s defeat.
“The statements of the US Army representatives that a part of the Syrian airspace belongs to the US is puzzling,” Konashenkov stated, reminding the Pentagon that “Syria is a sovereign state and a member of the United Nations, therefore, the United States does not own any part of sky.”
A ministry rep also noted that the US has so far neglected to offer explanations to the Russian command at the Khmeimim airbase in Syria “concerning this and many other incidents in the Syrian sky.”
The statement was made following TheNew York Times‘ Friday’s report,citing US commanders as expressing their concern over a possible collision between Russian and US warplanes over Syria, which might take place because of alleged violations of the deescalation deal by the Russian side a dozen times a day since the agreement had come into force.
“It’s become increasingly tough for our pilots to discern whether Russian pilots are deliberately testing or baiting us into reacting, or if these are just honest mistakes… The greatest concern is that we could shoot down a Russian aircraft because its actions are seen as a threat to our air or ground forces,” Lt. Col. Damien Pickart was quoted as saying by the media.
Col. Jeff Hogan, deputy commander of the air operations center at the Qatar base, told the newspaper that he had daily phone calls with Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov, but because of occasional misunderstandings, he had to make additional calls.
According to the newspaper, the military explained Moscow’s actions by the desire to entrench the positions of the Syrian army and cement its territorial acquisitions ahead of the peace talks aimed at ending the seven-year war.
Back in 2015, the US and Russia agreed upon the mutual flight safety memorandum regulating the flight paths and contacts of the countries’ air forces in Syria during an emergency. Since then, the two countries have traded accusatios over various incidents involving warplanes in the Syrian skies. Washington accused Russian jets of not carrying transponders allowing air-traffic controllers to identify them, while Moscow repeatedly said that the US military only “occasionally” indicate the time period and an approximate area of their air operations without even giving the types of aircraft and their affiliation.",1

"GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — The Green Bay Packers have waived Martellus Bennett, bringing the tight end's short tenure at Lambeau Field to a surprising end.
General manager Ted Thompson announced the move on Wednesday after practice.
The Packers cited a ""failure to disclose a physical condition"" for making the move. Bennett practiced on Tuesday after the bye last week before going on the injury report with a shoulder injury.
He didn't play in the 30-17 loss on Monday to the Detroit Lions after being listed as doubtful for the game.
Bennett also posted on Instagram during the bye week a message that indicated he was thinking about retirement.
""After conversations with my family I'm pretty sure these next eight games will be the conclusion of my NFL career,"" he wrote. ""To everyone who has poured themselves and time into my life and career. These next games are for you. Thank you.""
Bennett signed with the Packers as an unrestricted free agent last offseason and started seven games. He had 24 catches for 233 yards. Bennett dropped a few passes, but was an asset in the running game.
Bennett was listed as having not practiced on his last day with the team on Wednesday.
The injury would have kept him out of Sunday's game at Chicago, which is where Bennett calls home after spending the 2013 through 2015 seasons with the Bears.
""Martellus Bennett will not practice this week, he will not be available for the game,"" coach Mike McCarthy said before Wednesday's practice.
""I know he was in here yesterday, there's a number of opinions that he's working through, he met with our medical staff yesterday, so they're still going through the process, but he will be out against Chicago.""
During the season opener against Seattle, Bennett was one of three players who knelt for the national anthem. He is the brother of the Seahawks' Michael Bennett, who has sat during the anthem.
In free agency, Bennett got a three-year, $21 million contract that included a $6.3 million signing bonus. Bennett had base salaries of $900,000 this season, $3.6 million (plus a $2 million roster bonus) in 2018 and $5.65 million in 2019. The Packers could go after the prorated amount of that signing bonus, $4.2 million.
With a Chicago-based family and a passion for art and creativity, the 30-year-old Bennett was asked during training camp if he had considered retiring after winning a Super Bowl with New England last season.
""I think when I stop loving the preparation is when I will give it up because that's the most important part, whether that's working out or watching film and studying and taking notes,"" Bennett said in camp.
""Once I feel like my preparation goes down, I feel like that's when I will walk away. I think that will happen before my body gives out.""
The Packers have two other tight ends on the roster in Lance Kendricks and Richard Rodgers. Both have had 50-catch seasons. Kendricks has caught eight passes for 126 yards and one touchdown while Rodgers has caught four passes for 43 yards.

"Snap Inc.’s growth again fell short of estimates, feeding fears that aggressive competitionfrom Facebook Inc. is blunting the younger social-media company’s potential just months after its initial public offering.
The Los Angeles-based company said daily active users reached 173 million in the second quarter, compared with 166 million in the prior period. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected 175 million on average. Revenue also disappointed, and the shares tumbled as much as 18 percent in late trading.
Since its March public debut, the maker of the Snapchat mobile application for sending disappearing photos and videos has said it would become more popular as the company innovates and adds tools. In the second quarter, Snap added a maps function for users to see where friends are, as well as a search section. Yet rival Facebook has been successfully copying some of Snap’s key features on its larger social-media properties, drawing away users that might otherwise have downloaded Snapchat.
Facebook is also exerting pressure in the mobile advertising market. Snap said quarterly revenue was $181.7 million, missing the $185.8 million average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. While Snap has been updating its offerings to give advertisers more sophisticated options, the company has been struggling to prove it can secure its position in a market dominated by Facebook and Alphabet’s Google Inc.
This was a “make or break quarter” for Snap, James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi Hardt & Co., said in a note to investors. “Snap has tremendous potential if it can capitalize on the opportunity in front of it as an alternative platform for advertisers,” but the company is “under pressure from multiple fronts.”
The company’s shares slid as low as $11.31 in extended trading following its earnings release. The stock has slumped 19 percent since Snap’s March 1 IPO at $17 a share, closing at $13.77 in New York on Thursday.
On a call with investors Thursday, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel dismissed the threat from rival services.
“We’ve always been last to market competing against giant companies, and we’ve historically been able to grow our business in markets that are highly competitive and saturated by our competitors because we’re so focused on innovation,” he said.
For more on Snap, check out the Decrypted podcast:
Spiegel has been urging investors to think of Snap as different from Facebook. For example, the Snapchat app works more like a messaging product with a curated media section -- it doesn’t have a feed with ads slotted in like Facebook’s namesake network and its Instagram app The company isn’t focused on getting as big as possible, like Facebook. Instead, it wants to add users in the most lucrative markets -- such as the U. S. -- and get them more deeply addicted.
“We’d have to add more than 10 million daily active users in the rest of world for every 1 million daily active users in the U. S. and Canada in order to make the same amount of money,” Spiegel said.
Snap reported average revenue per user of $1.05 in the second quarter, with most of its growth coming from North America, bolstering the company’s argument that it’s growing in the right places. Daily active users on average posted 20 snaps a day. Users under 25 years old spent 40 minutes a day on Snapchat, compared to the 32 minutes a day for that age group that Instagram reports.
The company reported a net loss in the period of $443.1 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with a loss of $115.9 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier.
The stock also traded lower last week as some inside investors got the ability to sell their shares for the first time, after a lockup period following the IPO. The first lockup expired July 31. Spiegel said he and co-founder Bobby Murphy won’t sell any of their shares this year, even once they’re free to do so.
As Snap becomes cheaper, the company could be attractive to acquirers, said Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities. Spiegel, who has the majority of the voting power along with Murphy, is unlikely to want to sell this early, Seyrafi wrote in a note to investors.
“However, if Facebook continues to shamelessly copy Snap’s features and there is no clear road ahead for Snap to become net income or free cash flow positive, Mr. Spiegel’s position may change,” Seyrafi said.",0

"‘RosRAO, a subsidiary of Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, is among the three companies selected to build a system to filter radioactive tritium out of the contaminated water collected at the stricken power plant– a task that has so far defied engineers.
Fukushima Daiichi operator TEPCO, which has resorted to erecting thousands of water tanks to contain the toxic run-off from the plant, is already trialing a system that filters 62 radioactive materials. But the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) does not filter tritium, a mildly radioactive byproduct of nuclear generation, which nonetheless means that water cannot be safely discharged into the Pacific Ocean.
RosRAO, which was built on the foundations of Soviet-era waste disposal research institutions, won the TEPCO tender for a filtration system – alongside US firm Kurion Inc, and GE Hitachi Canada, a joint project between the Japanese and US corporations – beating 26 other companies.
Each of the three contractors will be given 1 billion yen – about $9.5 million – to present a working filter prototype by the March 2016 deadline, and the final value of the contract, which could last for decades, could run into hundreds of million dollars.
“We are offering a unique combined filtering technology, unlike our Western colleagues, which allows it to be more cost-efficient,” said project manager Sergey Florya in an interview with RIA Novosti news agency.’

"More than 100 US universities and colleges have interests offshore where they pay little or no tax and seek to grow their already phenomenal riches away from public scrutiny, the Paradise Papers reveal.
With combined endowments of more than $500bn (378bn), the leaked documents show universities have become big players in offshore games. In contrast to the stated mission of open discourse espoused by many prestigious seats of higher education, investments are frequently held in secret entities that help them minimize their contribution to the public purse.
Most contentiously, some of the offshore funds are invested in carbon-polluting industries, despite leading US universities playing a key role in the fight against climate change.
In total, 104 US universities and colleges are named in data from the law firm Appleby. They include Ivy League institutions such as Princeton, as well as some of America’s best-known state schools such as Rutgers in New Jersey and Ohio State.
Four of the top 10 schools by endowment are in the files: Columbia, Princeton, Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania. Between them, they have reserves of $73.7bn.
Appleby’s files list 45 offshore concerns, including private equity and hedge funds mainly in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, as recipients.
Typical of the entries is Northeastern University in Boston, which prides itself on being at the forefront of sustainability. In April, it invited Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, to open its $225m Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex (ISEC).
The building has sun-shading aluminium fins that lead into a bright six-storey atrium dominated by a white spiral staircase.
Northeastern describes ISEC as a “research village” where students can build a humanoid robot named Valkyrie with the help of Nasa, develop cybersecurity tools to protect data and use infrared rays to destroy cancer cells.
But despite the complex’s ideals and goals, which include seeking solutions to rising sea levels and pollution, Northeastern is one of 12 prominent US universities and colleges named in the Paradise Papers as investors in EnCap Energy Capital Fund IX-C, a hedge fund based in the Cayman Islands.
The fund acts as a feeder to a subsidiary based in Houston, Texas, of EnCap Investments, one of the world’s largest private equity companies, which describes itself as the “leading provider of venture capital to independent oil and gas companies”.
Since 1988, the company has pumped almost $20bn into oil and shale gas exploration and production, with investments in Utica shale in Ohio and Pennsylvania, oil in the Permian Basin of Texas, and Haynesville and Bossier shale in western Louisiana.
Academic institutions that have put money into EnCap include state schools such as Alabama, Rutgers and Washington State (WSU), and private institutions such as Syracuse University and Reed College.
Northeastern’s secret investment in an aggressive financial backer of carbon-emitting industries came as a surprise to members of DivestNU, a coalition of student groups campaigning for a fossil-fuel-free campus.
James DeCunzo, 19, a DivestNU organizer, said: “The university’s motto is ‘light, truth and virtue’.”
“Now we learn that the leadership team has been operating in darkness, violating their own green principles by investing in oil and gas, and going offshore to pay less tax.”
DivestNU has spent the past four years trying to persuade the university to reveal information about its fossil fuel investments, with little success. In July 2016, Northeastern’s senior leadership team announced that it would invest $25m of its endowment in clean energy and renewables, boasting that the institution was a “leader in sustainability practices”.
But in the same breath the administration, whose vice-chair of the board of trustees, Ed Galante, is a former senior vice-president of ExxonMobil, declared that it was opposed to divestment. “We have deliberately chosen to invest, not divest,” it said.
The students of DivestNU see Northeastern’s investment in EnCap’s offshore hedge fund as confirmation of a critical flaw in its approach. DeCunzo said: “Northeastern has an opportunity to be a leader in how it uses its endowment for impactful, socially responsible investments. But the way things are now, the values of our investments are out of alignment with the values of our teaching.”
As of June 2016, Northeastern’s endowment was $702m, about average for a major US school. The Guardian asked the university to disclose how much of this reserve was invested offshore, but it declined to do so, saying only that the investments were “limited”.
In a statement, the university said all of its investments were “managed to maximize the opportunities for furthering our educational and research mission. It is important that we diversify our portfolio to maximize the return on these investments within the strict guidelines of the law”.
It is impossible to say how many tax havens Northeastern uses or how much it invests in the Cayman Islands offshoot of EnCap. However, given that many hedge funds are based offshore it is likely that some of the $320m it has invested in private equity, hedge funds and alternative investments is held in tax havens.
At the University of Pittsburgh, another investor in EnCap in the Cayman Islands, students have learned that about one-third of its $3.5bn endowment is directly invested, of which $26m has gone into fossil fuel industries.
Anas Peterson of the Fossil Free Pitt Coalition said: “We are concerned about the lack of transparency, as two-thirds of the endowment is just a mystery to us.”
“We are suspicious about where that huge segment of the endowment is going.”
Universities’ collective move offshore has been propelled by huge recent growth in their endowments, with the latest figures from Nacubo, the association of academic business officers, showing that the leading 805 schools in the US amassed an eye-watering $515bn in 2016.
As reserves have swelled, cash has increasingly been directed towards “alternative strategies” such as hedge funds, venture capital and private equity, many of which exist offshore. These made up 52% in 2016 – equivalent to about $268bn – up from 20% in 2002.
Tax experts believe the amount invested offshore is substantial given the tax advantages of putting alternative investments in tax-exempt jurisdictions such as Bermuda. A study by Norman Silber and John Wei of Yale estimates that offshore sums may be greater than $100bn.
Silber, a senior research scholar at Yale, said: “The riskiness of investments is no longer required to be transparent. This is a problem for the public, but it’s also a problem for boards of directors, as even they are being kept in the dark.”
Under the current US tax structure, schools have an incentive to move offshore because it allows them legally to avoid paying federal tax on hedge fund and private equity investments.
Universities increasingly seek to shield themselves from the tax on unrelated business income by funneling their endowment money through so-called “blocker corporations”, which pay no tax if they are set up offshore.
There are several offshore blocker corporations with university partners named in the Paradise Papers. Among them is EnCap Energy Capital Fund IX-C, which is mentioned in Appleby’s files as “treated as a corporation for US income tax purposes – blocker corporation”.
Other blockers to be found among the millions of documents in the Paradise Papers include H&F Investors Blocker in Bermuda. Until it was dissolved in 2011, it had Columbia, Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, Stanford and the University of Southern California (USC) among its partners.
In the Cayman Islands, Genstar Capital Partners V HV, a subsidiary of a company specializing in buyouts, services Colgate University, Dartmouth, Stanford and Gothic Corporation, which provides financial support to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.
The Guardian contacted all the universities and colleges named in this piece. Other than Northeastern, only four responded. None of the four – Dartmouth, Stanford, USC and WSU – would disclose how much money they had offshore.
Dartmouth said it invested in offshore funds at the choice of investment managers, but did not avoid taxes. The college reports all taxable income and pays the same US taxes as if the funds were held domestically, it said.
Stanford said that as a charitable institution, its income from the endowment was essential to support research and provide financial assistance to students unable to afford its fees. As for the offshore portion, “Stanford looks to minimize its tax burden within the limits set by law”, it said.
USC said the now inactive Bermuda blocker it invested in was “not an opaque investment” and insisted it included all its investments in university tax filings. WSU pointed out that its endowment was managed by a legally separate foundation independently responsible for all investment decisions.
The proliferation of offshore endowment investments that pay minimal or no tax on their returns presents students at many of the leading US schools with a dilemma. On the one hand, they know they personally benefit from the profits that flow on to their campuses, but on the other, they have serious ethical qualms.
Alissa Zimmer, 22, one of the founding members of DivestNU, receives about $40,000 a year in subsidies to her tuition fees, spent four months largely tuition-fee-free on a study program in Rio de Janeiro, and has access to state-of-the-art facilities such as ISEC.
When challenged by other students as to why she is protesting over Northeastern’s policy while accepting financial aid, Zimmer said she replies: “Sure, I’m benefiting from Northeastern and its wealth, but that’s not a reason to stay quiet.
“It’s a reason to speak out, to improve the university for those who come after me.”
* This article was amended on 8 November 2017 to clarify that the University of Texas is not one of the top 10 US universities by endowment.",0

Johnny Depp has wasted away hundreds of millions of dollars in epic fashion and has just about reached rock bottom — for a movie star, at least.
At one time the “Pirates of the Caribbean” was the proud owner of 14 properties around the world and an extravagant yacht to top it off. But after spending his $650 million in earnings over just a 13-year-span he’s been forced to sell some of his real estate and even worse he’s now selling his Kentucky horse farm at auction.
Depp’s 41-acre property in Lexington, complete with a 6,000-square-foot home, a guesthouse and three horse barns will be sold at auction next month, according to The Lexington Herald-Leader. The auction is set for September 15 and will be conducted by Halfhill Auction Group.
Depp, who is a Kentucky native, originally purchased the property in 1995. The 53-year-old actor later sold the farm in 2001 and bought it back again in 2005, according to Page Six.
The movie star’s self-inflicted financial crisis then led to him listing the farm for sale again in December with an original asking price of $3.4 million, but later dropped to $2.9 million.
Depp is in an ongoing legal battle with his former financial advisors from The Management Group over his truly impressive loss of wealth. Back when they were still advising him, Depp began unloading his worldwide properties in an attempt to save him from financial ruin, but that clearly didn’t work out as planned.

"It certainly looked like a bomb. ""Transformers: The Last Knight,"" which cost Paramount Pictures Corp. over $350 million to make and market, earned a lame $69 million during its first five days in U. S. theaters in mid-June. Paramount executives could overlook that performance because in China, where the ""Transformers"" series has enjoyed a decade of wild popularity, the film earned over $123 million during the same period. But the time when Hollywood filmmakers could count on Chinese viewers to rescue them from disaster may be rapidly coming to an end.
The world's second-biggest movie market (and soon to be its biggest), China has bailed out Hollywood's box-office bombs for years. The list of examples is long, led by the first four ""Transformers"" films, all of which have been massive hits in China despite generally poor reviews elsewhere.
It’s easy to see why, too. To this day, Chinese films can’t match the technical and artistic standards found in Hollywood productions, even the clunkers(a state of affairs acknowledged by China's best filmmakers). Government censorship worsens the problem.
In 2007, the first ""Transformers"" film was China's top-grossingmovie. (In the U. S., it was number three.) That was quite an accomplishment: Chinese authorities limit foreign theatrical releases to very limited runs, ideally at times they won't compete against strong Chinese films. Pirated DVDs reached many more Chinese who couldn’t see the movie in theaters, and its 2009 sequel doubled the first film’s gross, becoming China's second-biggest film of the year (just behind ""2012,"" another Hollywood shlockfest).
Since then, the audience for the ""Transformers"" series has grown roughly at the same rate as China's box office, giving executives at Paramount and other studios good reason to believe that Chinese audiences had an inexhaustible appetite for nonsensical, humorless storylines about battling alien robots. Indeed, earlier this year, even the abysmal ""xXx: The Return of Xander Cage"" earned 47 percent of its $346 million gross in China (the U. S. contributed a mere 13 percent).
Two years ago, after a string of U. S. flops did particularly well in China, articles complained that the country had become a Hollywood ""dumping ground."" China’s otherwise patriotic social media users largely dismissed the criticism, noting that ""bad Chinese films are worse.""
The opening for ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" would seem to confirm the pattern. But the numbers tell a different story. Although the movie’s China gross is expected to hit $250 million, that would be17 percent less than its 2014 predecessor -- at a time when China's box office has grown 80 percent.
That’s a warning that China's tastes are changing for the better, and Hollywood isn't ready. In addition to “Transformers,” the pirated DVD boom of the 1990s and 2000s introduced Chinese audiences to a broad range of Hollywood and other fare otherwise blockedin China. More recently, smartphones and streaming video apps havebrought an even more diverse set of entertainment options to Chinese audiences.
As a result, Chinese are becoming more discerning about what they pay to see, and are no longer as easily seduced by Hollywood spectacle. Last summer, Chinese box office receipts declined for the first time in five years (box office fraud may have also played a role).
The biggest Chinese box office surprise of 2017 wasn't a sci-fi adventure, but “Dangal,” a critically acclaimed Indian family drama in which two young women push back against traditional gender roles. The theme resonated strongly in still-conservative China (even the country’s traditionally minded President Xi Jinping praised the film), and so far it's earned over $190 million -- making it China's fourth-biggest film of the year so far. And, unlike ""The Last Knight,"" which has experienced precipitously falling receipts since its release, the weekly take for “Dangal” actually increased over much of its run.
If, as expected, China expands the quota for foreign films, big Hollywood productions will face competition from smaller and more sophisticated U. S. dramas, too. And it's not just U.S. and Indian movies that’ll tempt viewers. Chinese films continue to improve, with locally produced fare now successfully competing against Hollywood's best (and worst). Last year, “The Mermaid,” a Hong Kong-Chinese romantic comedy, earned the biggest box office in Chinese history, while other local comedies are regularly outselling the Hollywood competition.
That hardly means that Hollywood doesn't have a future in China. Diverse, character-oriented action films like the ""Fast and the Furious"" series continue to do well on the mainland, and special effects blockbusters -- especially good ones -- will always be popular anywhere in the world. But the days of Hollywood being able to assume that its worst efforts will see their best returns in China are numbered.

"Iran have announced that their Iranian Naval forces have successfully fired three coast-to-sea cruise missiles on the third day of wargames being conducted along the country’s Southeastern Makran coast, on the rims of the Persian Gulf.
The missile test comes days aftera US Navy warship received a warning from several Iranian destroyers to steer clear of their zone near the Strait of Hormuz.
The Nour cruise missiles fired by the Iranian Navy hit a target in the Sea of Oman earlier today.
Two Nour cruise missiles were fired from Alborz and Neyzeh warships in the Persian Gulf waters and the third one from a missile-launcher stationed in the coast.
Nour is a well-known cruise missile with a range of over 120km used by the Iranian army and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) in different wargames and can be launched from coasts, vessels and aircrafts against enemy vessels, oil facilities and naval positions.
The main phase of the drills codenamed ‘Velayat 94’ kicked off on Wednesday along the Makran coasts and Northern waters of the Indian Ocean upon the order of Navy Commander Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari. The initial stage, that includes transfer of troops and logistics, began on January 21.
In a relevant development on Thursday, the Iranian Navy airborne forces fired torpedoes at surface and subsurface vessels on the second day of the main phase of massive wargames.
The airborne units also carried out mine laying and mine-clearing operations in the Sea of Oman and the Indian Ocean.
The Iranian marines sailing on the speedboats used light and heavy arms against the simulated enemy.
The Navy’s speedboats, including Shahab, Ra’d and Ashoura class vessels, participated in the Thursday wargames.
Also, the Navy’s 38th fleet of warships, comprising Naqdi destroyer and Bushehr and Lavan warships, which is tasked to conduct anti-piracy patrols in the high seas and the Gulf of Aden joined the Iranian naval forces in the exercises.
Different Navy surface and subsurface units, including destroyers, logistic warships, missile-launching warships and Qadir and Tareq class submarines are part of the exercises and have docked along the Strait of Hormuz to the 10-degree latitude of the Northern Indian Ocean.
Velayat 94 navy defense drills include deployment of Navy units, running tactics, firing missiles and torpedoes, as well as Special Marines parade.
During the drills on Wednesday, a US Navy warship received a serious warning from several Iranian destroyers to keep away from their zone near the Strait of Hormuz – an incident that can keep frictions high after Iran captured 10 US marines in the Persian Gulf earlier this month.
The USS MONTEREY (CG 61), a TICONDEROGA class cruiser, was sailing near the Strait of Hormuz where the Iranian forces were staging the main phase of the Velayat 94.
According to the Iranian Army, the US warship left the region immediately after receiving the warning. Rear Admiral Sayyari said the warship seemed to be planning to spy on Iranian vessels and weapons.
“Some still seem to be holding no belief in Iran’s naval power; hence they attempt to come close to get informed of our moves and capabilities,” the Admiral said on Wednesday.
The incident was the second naval showdown between the United States and Iran in Persian Gulf waters in just two weeks.
On January 12, nine men and one woman from the US Navy strayed into the Iranian territorial waters near the Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. They were immediately captured by the IRGC.
Their boats were equipped with 50mm caliber machine guns and other light and semi-heavy weapons. Many regional analysts have also praised the IRGC’s brave reaction to the US aggression.
The IRGC freed the 10 a day later and after it was proved that the US marines had strayed into Iranian waters only due to the failure of their navigation devices and equipment.",1
"Hurricane Jose is expected to pass east of the North Carolina coast on Monday and remain off the US East Coast, while Tropical Storm Maria formed and is forecast to become a hurricane early next week, the US National Hurricane Centre said on Saturday.
Maria could threaten several Caribbean islands, some of which were devastated by Hurricane Irma less than two weeks ago. It is expected to approach the Leeward Islands on Monday and become a hurricane around that time, the NHC said.
A hurricane watch is in effect for Antigua, Barbuda, St Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat and France has also issued a hurricane watch for the island of Guadeloupe. A hurricane watch is typically issued 48 hours before the first occurrence of storm-force winds, NHC said.
Meanwhile, the NHC said the coastline from North Carolina to New England should monitor Hurricane Jose’s progress and forecast that tropical storm watches may be needed for portions of that stretch during the next day or two.
“However, an increase in the size of the storm or a westward adjustment in the track forecast could bring tropical storm conditions closer to the Outer Banks” of North Carolina, the forecast said.
As a large cyclone, Jose could also affect the Virginia-to-New England area, especially if it deviates from its forecast track, the NHC said.
At 5 pm New York time, the NHC said Hurricane Jose was moving northward at 106 km/h, with maximum sustained winds of 130km/h.",1

"Scientists have observed two stars colliding into each other in deepspacecausing the universe to ""shake"" spewing out massive amounts of gold in a strange alchemical explosion. The super-dense stars crashed into each other 130 million light years away and as a result of the collision, huge amounts of precious metals and other heavy elements were spewed out kick-starting a ""new chapter in astrophysics"".SpaceScientists have reported that the explosion had ""rocked"" the fabric of the universe and distorting space-time as a result.The discovery is the fifth time that gravitational waves have been spotted on Earth.
The Independent reports: Scientists didn't just ""hear"" the violent blast by seeing the ripples in spacetime. They were also able to use telescopes on satellites and the ground to see the light and radiation that was being flung out of the explosion, which is known as a ""kilonova"".And that information is going to be relied on for years to come as scientists learn more about the beginnings of such stars, and even our entire universe, astronomers said. The new event – though still very distant – was much closer and completely different in nature. It was caused by colliding neutron stars – burned out remnants of giant stars so dense that a teaspoon of their material on Earth would weigh a billion tons.The two objects, each about 12 miles in diameter, stretched and distorted spacetime as theyspiralledtowards each other and finally collided.Like ripples from a stone thrown in a pond, the gravitational waves fanned out across the universe at the speed of light.They were picked up on Earth by two incredibly sensitive detectors in Washington and Louisiana in the US, operated by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo).It was here the first discovery of gravitational waves was made in September 2015, confirming a prediction made by Albert Einstein 100 years ago and earning three pioneers of the project a Nobel Prize.Two seconds after the Ligo detection, a burst of gamma rays from the neutron star collision was captured by Nasa's Fermi space telescope.Astronomers around the world quickly turned their telescopes and dishes towards a small patchinthe southern sky and also saw the flash across the visible and invisible light spectrum.Analysis of the light revealed something astonishing – the manufacture of gold on a cosmic scale, as well as other heavy elements.
DrJoe Lyman from the University of Warwick, one of many British scientists involved, said: ""The exquisite observations obtained in a few days showed we were observing a kilonova, an object whose light is powered by extreme nuclear reactions.""This tells us that the heavy elements, like the gold or platinum injewellery, are the cinders forged in the billion degree remnants of a merging neutron star.""The origins of gold and other heavy elements have been a long-standing mystery, but recent evidence has suggested that colliding neutron stars could have a hand in their creation. A third gravitational wave facility called Virgo near Pisa, Italy, also registered a faint signal from the event, allowing scientists to triangulate its position.The neutron star collision took place 130 million light years away in a relatively old galaxy called NGC 4993. When the gravitational waves began their journey across space, dinosaurs roamed the Earth.The gravitational wave signal, named GW170817, was detected at 1.41pm UK time on August 17.Ligo's detectors, consisting of L-shaped tunnels with arms 2.5 miles long, use laser beams bouncing off mirrors to measure movement across a distance 10,000 times smaller than the width of a proton, the kernel of an atom.The international researchers expect to spend many months trawling through the mountain of data.One question already answered is the origin of short-durationgamma raybursts.Gamma raybursts (GRBs), marked by an eruption of gamma rays lasting milliseconds to several minutes, are the most powerful explosions known to science.Scientists now know that one type of GRB is generated when neutron stars collide.DrSamantha Oates, also from the University of Warwick, said: ""This discovery has answered three questions that astronomers have been puzzling for decades: what happens when neutron stars merge? What causes the short duration gamma-ray bursts? Where are the heavy elements, like gold, made?""In the space of about aweekall three of these mysteries were solved.""ColleagueDrDanny Steeghs said: ""This is a new chapter in astrophysics.""British Ligo scientist Professor BS Sathyaprakash, from the University of Cardiff, described the new discovery as ""truly a eureka moment"".He added: ""The 12 hours that followed are inarguably the most exciting hours of my scientific life. This event marks a turning point in observational astronomy and will lead to a treasure trove of scientific results.""Professor Bernard Schutz, also from the University of Cardiff, told how his team used the gravitational wave detections to measure the expansion of the universe more accurately than had ever been achieved before.""What has amazed me ... is that with just this one measurement, we got a result right in the middle between the two rather different values that astronomers have measured recently,"" he said.Dr David Shoemaker, spokesman for the Ligo scientific collaboration and senior research scientist at the US Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said: ""From informing detailed models of the inner workings of neutron stars and the emissions they produce, to more fundamental physics such as general relativity, this event is just so rich.""It is a gift that will keep on giving.""Ligo colleague Professor Laura Cadonati, from Georgia Institute of Technology, US, said: ""This detection has genuinely opened the doors to a new way of doing astrophysics.""I expect it will be remembered as one of the most studied astrophysical events in history.""",1

"SAN JUAN, P. R. — The CEO of Whitefish Energy, the small Montana company under intense scrutiny for an up to $300 million contract to help restore power to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, said that he first made contact with officials on the island through the social networking site LinkedIn — and not through any previous connections.
In an interview with NBC News in San Juan, CEO Andy Techmanski responded to growing calls from Capitol Hill for the contract to be terminated.
""I think that there are people out there on a witch hunt looking for something that does not exist,"" he said.
Techmanski insists he first reached out to officials with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) — he did not name exactly who — through LinkedIn shortly after Hurricane Irma hit in early September. That storm knocked out power to 1 million.
Techmanski said he kept in contact with the power authority as Hurricane Maria approached. On Sept. 26, six days after Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, he said he flew down to the island to speak directly with PREPA officials.
The Whitefish contract controversy erupted in recent days largely following a report in The Washington Post detailing the mounting questions surrounding the deal. Since then, members of Congress from both parties have called for investigations. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello has referred a local audit to the territory’s Office of the Comptroller and he wants the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general to look into the contract.
""They can audit it,"" Techmanski said. ""There is nothing to hide.""
It was widely reported that Whitefish only had two full-time employees when Maria made landfall, a number not disputed by Whitefish’s own newly-hired media team at the time.
But Techmanski now argues that figure is incorrect, and that the company had 20-40 full-time employees working projects in Arizona, Montana and Washington State. He said Whitefish has more than 350 workers in Puerto Rico and plans to have more than 500 there soon.
""We're here doing actual work,"" Techmanski said. ""We're under a contract and we came in good faith, and I think we're making an impact.""
He strongly denies that U. S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke — also from Whitefish, Montana — or anyone else in the Trump administration had anything to do with securing the contract. Zinke said in a statement Friday that ""I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico"" and any suggestions of involvement or influence ""are completely baseless.""
Still, in a written statement Friday, FEMA said it had “significant concerns” and had not approved the deal, despite a portion of the contract that suggested otherwise.
""That's simply not something we would do,"" Mike Byrne, FEMA's coordinator in Puerto Rico, told NBC News on Saturday.

According to the contract, the labor rates were $240 an hour for a general foreman and $227 for a lineman. Almost $80 a day for meals, and $332 a day for lodging were included.
""Some of the costs that they showed us, we felt we needed to have a harder look,” Byrne said. “We're going to give them a chance to make the case as to why those are higher than what we would've thought we'd see and if it's legitimate, then we'll accept it. If it's not legitimate, then we're going to end up telling them what we will be willing to pay.""
In the document, there is also a portion that reads: ""By executing the Contract, PREPA hereby represents and warrants that FEMA has reviewed and approved of this Contract.""
Techmanski said that language wasn’t supposed to be there and has been deleted from an amended version of the contract, which he declined to provide.
""I haven't compared them side-by-side,” he said. “But certainly an oversight.""
Techmanski’s signature was on the original document — along with that of Ricardo Ramos, the recently-appointed head of PREPA, the embattled utility company that is $9 billion in debt and went bankrupt in July after a long history of maintenance problems and corruption allegations.
On Saturday, officials with PREPA did not comment and said Ramos was not immediately available. But on Thursday, Ramos said at a news conference that if he had to approve the contract again, he would – and that there had not been anything illegal or out of order.
Related: Democrats Call for Investigation Into Whitefish Energy Contract in Puerto Rico
Ramos attributed the criticism of the deal to ""mainly gossip from the U. S"" and suggested it could be coming from other contractors who didn't get the job.
Ramos said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Friday that the language in the contract should have been removed, but ""there's no other explanation for that other than an 'oops.'""
""There was a lot of pressure to sign the contract immediately, not from Whitefish but from me,"" Ramos told the newspaper. He told the Journal that the process met PREPA's regulations for handling emergency situations.
Techmanski said Whitefish has been paid about $8-10 million so far.
When asked whether he thought the contract had been rushed, Techmanski said: ""How can you take time with a contract that has to do with millions of people being out of power? It's not something that could take days or weeks to contemplate. The priority and should still remain the priority is getting power back to the people of Puerto Rico. So do I think it was rushed? No.""",0
"The number of cars on England's roads has risen by almost 600,000 in one year.
Latest figures show there were 25.8 million licensed cars in the third quarter of 2015 compared with 25.2 million in the same period of 2014.
Since 2011, the number has increased by about 1.6 million in England, 142,000 in Scotland and 69,000 in Wales.
The largest rise has been in south-east England, with 373,200 more cars over five years.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said there had been 2.63 million new cars made during 2015, a 6.3% rise on the year before. Production also hit a seven-year high.
Reasons suggested by the RAC Foundation include the growing population and even the rise in women in work.
Updates on this story and more from England.
Meanwhile, bus use has fallen across two-thirds of English council areas over six years, which the Campaign for Better Transport blamed on cuts in funding for supported services.
Department for Transport statistics reveal in five out of nine English regions, there is now at least one car for every two people.
South-east England has 561 cars for every 1,000 people.
The rate has also increased in London and the West Midlands in the past year, but the areas still have fewer cars per person than they did in 2011.
Philip Gomm, from the RAC Foundation, said the cost of buying a car had fallen over the past decade.
He said: ""Over the past 20 years, the rise in the number of cars on the road in Britain has been relentless, going up from 21 million in 1995 to 31 million in 2015.
""The reasons behind this include: a swiftly growing population; economic prosperity; an increase in the number of households; more people than ever in employment and the growth of women in work.""
James MacColl, from the Campaign for Better Transport, said bus fare increases meant it would be difficult to ""solve the problem of more cars on the road"".
""It is vital bus services are properly funded as they are a lifeline for those who rely on them to access essential services such as work, schools, health services and shops.""
A Department for Transport spokesman said it was making sure all parts of the transport network received investment.
A 250m grant for bus companies was protected in last year's Spending Review, he added.",0

Professor Vyvyan Evans is an internationally renowned expert on language and digital communication. He has published 14 books on language, meaning and mind. This is an edited excerpt from his latest book, ""The Emoji Code"" published by Picador and Michael O'Mara Books.
Emojis have become, without a doubt, a design classic. But how effective are they as a communication tool? Over 6 billion emojis are sent on a daily basis, with over 90% of the world's online community making regular use of them. Emojis may be one of Japan's greatest-ever exports.
Today they are even officially classified as art. In 2016, New York's Museum of Modern Art added emojis to its permanent collection -- more specifically, the original 176 emojis, designed by Tokyo-based software engineer Shigetaka Kurita in 1999.
Kurita's original emojis, licensed to the MoMA by NTT DoCoMo, now sit alongside works by Pablo Picasso and Jackson Pollock.
In the late 1990s, Kurita -- working for NTT DoCoMo, one of the largest Japanese mobile telephone operators -- was involved in the development of the world's first commercial, mobile-specific internet browser system. Given display limitations in early Japanese smart phone screens, Kurita decided to develop pictograms to make displaying information more effective.
Taking their name from the Japanese word for ""picture character,"" emojis were born.
Is emoji a language?
What makes English, Japanese, or Swahili a language is the presence of two things: words and rules. And it is the unique nature of this organization that allows us to express complex and subtle ideas that cannot be expressed using other systems of communication.
1/7 – Emoji (original set of 176), 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita
Emoji enables us to better express tone and provide emotional cues; and in turn, our addressees are better able to interpret what the words are meant to convey.

Language is organized into meaningful units such as words, and a system of rules -- a grammar -- that enables us to compose our words and express everything from the gnawing ache of unrequited love to a banal observation on the weather.
Compared to, say, English, emoji has a far, far smaller 'vocabulary.'
A few of Kurita's early emoji faces  Credit: Shigetaka Kurita
While new emojis are introduced each year, the number of emojis available is vanishingly small compared to the range and complexity of vocabulary items that a competent native speaker possesses -- currently there are fewer than 2,000 emojis available on a smartphone near you.
Compare this with the English words you have at your fingertips: by the age of five, and barely out of kindergarten, you would already have known around 5,000 English words, reaching an impressive 12,000 by your early teens -- far outstripping the total number of emojis currently available.
But adding more and more emojis will only get us so far.
A potentially insurmountable problem is the sheer difficulty of expressing abstract ideas using a pictographic form. Winks, smileys, eggplants and dumplings are one thing -- but how might we go about representing, say, ""chauvinism,"" ""feminist,"" ""ethical"" or ""iconoclastic"" in emoji?
The proposed new dumpling emoji
Even if an emoji ""language"" could somehow overcome the lack of working vocabulary to express all the things we need a language to say, words, on their own, still don't get us very far.
The hallmark of language is grammar. We use it, without even knowing it, to do the heavy lifting: combining vocabulary items to create sentences of potentially great complexity.
But even this has not put off some dedicated aficionados.
For instance, designer Ken Hale is so passionate about emoji that he has translated literary classics like Alice in Wonderland into the characters. Hale calls his approach to creating an emoji language ""crypto-semantics.""
Nevertheless, like any language, unless you go through a process of learning what the symbols mean and how they are combined, then Hale's emoji language remains a foreign tongue.
Quotations from Alice in Wonderland, translated into Emoji by Joe Hale
Communicating emotion in the digital age
So if emoji isn't a language, what is it for? Some see emoji as little more than an adolescent grunt, taking us back to the dark ages of illiteracy. But this prejudice fundamentally misunderstands the nature of communication -- and in so doing, it radically underestimates the potentially powerful and beneficial role of emoji in the digital age as a communication tool.
All too often we think of language as the kingpin in our everyday world of meaning. But much of the meaning we convey and glean in our everyday social encounters comes from nonverbal cues.
In the spoken medium, gesture, facial expression, body language and speech intonation provide a means of qualifying and adjusting the message conveyed by our words. A wink or smile provides a crucial cue, aiding our understanding.
Digital communication provides us with an important channel of communication in our increasingly connected social and professional lives.
But the rich, communicative context available in face-to-face encounters is largely absent in a digital setting. Digital text-speak alone is impoverished, seemingly possessing the power to strip all forms of nuanced expression from even the best of us. But here emoji can help: it fulfills a similar function in digital communication to that of gesture, body language and intonation in spoken interaction.
Emoji enables us to better express tone and provide emotional cues; and in turn, our addressees are better able to interpret what the words are meant to convey.
How emojis can reveal the meaning behind words
Imagine you send this text to a friend or partner: ""I tripped and banged my head on the cupboard."" They might not know whether to sympathize or laugh. But a sad face at the end provides a nonverbal cue, a metacomment, providing a clear tell: ""I'm in pain."" A tears of joy emoji, on the other hand, tells us the sender finds the situation funny: ""I'm such a buffoon.""
We live in a digital age, and emoji is an adaptation to this most recent arena of human interaction.
It helps get the job done when the tried and tested interpersonal cues that oil spoken interaction are absent.
And in the process, it helps avoid what I dub the ""angry jerk"" phenomenon: the emoji-less emails and texts that seem to be shouting at us. Emoji puts the nuancing back in, better allowing us to express our emotional selves in our brave new 21st century world.",0
"HE WAS a hero who saved 30 people. Now Jonathan Smith is worried about making ends meet as Las Vegas survivors face mounting bills.
VICTIMS of the Las Vegas shooting are facing mounting medical bills that could add up to in excess of $771 million (US$600 million), according to one expert who said the cost will be “beyond staggering.”
HE WAS a hero who saved 30 people. Now Jonathan Smith is worried about making ends meet as Las Vegas survivors face mounting bills.
VICTIMS of the Las Vegas shooting are facing mounting medical bills that could add up to in excess of $771 million (US$600 million), according to one expert who said the cost will be “beyond staggering.”
Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation expert Ted Miller told Newsweek the Las Vegas tragedy will likely cost more than $771 million in terms of medical bills, mental healthcare, physical therapy, loss of income and police work following the crisis.
He said the “beyond staggering” figure is extremely difficult to calculate given the death toll could rise and many people will have ongoing medical care following the event.
“Indeed, many, many people who were not physically injured will be seeing a therapist, perhaps haunted by PTSD,” Miller said.
Fifty-nine people including Stephen Paddock were killed and at least 527 injured during Sunday night’s mass shooting that became the deadliest in recent US history.
Medical centres worked at capacity to process those injured, with trauma surgeons and nurses recounting the horror of “unusual” injuries created by the semiautomatic weapons and a seemingly endless flow of blood inside the emergency departments.
University Medical Centre trauma surgeon Jay Coates said he had “no idea who I operated on” during the night in which the clinic processed hundreds of patients.
“They were coming in so fast, we were taking care of bodies. We were just trying to keep people from dying. Every bed was full. We had people in the hallways, people outside and more people coming in.”
Now, stories are emerging of victims faced with mounting bills who are starting to wonder how they are going to meet escalating costs.
Orange County man Jonathan Smith, 30, was hailed a hero after saving around 30 lives during the attack but was left with a bullet lodged in his neck.
His sister-in-law Tiffany Jones has started a Go Fund Me page saying the young father is unable to support his family because of the costs his medical bills will incur.
“Jonathan Smith is a loving father of 3 children, Jonathan Jr, Jayden Starr and Julian,” she wrote online. “He is currently unable to support his family as a result of this horrible event as his body requires time to heal from such an injury.
“In addition to this, he will need to pay medical expenses — much of which will need to come out of pocket.”
Canadian Hudson Mack is also wondering what his bill will be after his 21-year old son Sheldon was caught up during a birthday visit to the US done without travel insurance.
Sheldon has had his colon removed but is now out of intensive care and doctors may leave bullet fragments in his arm.
“We don’t even know what our bill is right now but I’m sure it’s already substantial and will keep going up,” Hudson Mack told Canadian news site CBA.
“We’ve been told that we’ll probably be here till the end of the week at least. They want to make sure that there is no risk of infection to the abdominal surgery,” Hudson Mack said.
Gun violence is a costly epidemic in the US, with a recent study based on emergency department visits between 2006 and 2014 showing the cost per patient was between $6,755 (US$5,254) for entering the emergency department to around $123,291 (US$95,887) once an overnight stay is included.
The annual bill is around $3.6 billion (US$2.8 billion) in emergency department and inpatient charges.
Nearly $12 million (US$10 million) has been raised towards helping the victims in an online fundraiser organised by Las Vegas Clark County Commission Chair Steve Sisolak. Large donations have been made by local hotels and sports teams, with thousands of smaller contributions from sympathisers around the world.
“Funds will be used to provide relief and financial support to the victims and families of the horrific Las Vegas mass shooting,” Sisolak said.
The means of distribution has not yet been announced but he said they would work with the National Center for Victims of Crime (NCVC) to ensure funds go directly to victims.",1

"CVS Pharmacy will limit opioid prescriptions to a seven-day supply for certain conditions, becoming the first national retail chain to restrict how many pain pills doctors can give patients.
When filling prescription for opioid pills, pharmacists will also be required to talk to patients about the risks of addiction, secure storage of medications in the home and proper disposal, the retail pharmacy chain said Thursday.
The move by CVS to limit prescription opioids like OxyContin or Vicodin to a seven-day supply is a significant restriction for patients — the average pill supply given by doctors in the U. S. increased from 13 days in 2006 to 18 days 2015, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
'We are further strengthening our commitment to help providers and patients balance the need for these powerful medications with the risk of abuse and misuse,” Larry J. Merlo, President and CEO, CVS Health said in a statement.
CVS, which manages medications for nearly 90 million customers at 9,700 retail locations, plans to roll out the initiatives to control opioid abuse as of February 1, 2018.
Related: One in Three Americans Took Prescription Opioid Painkillers in 2015, Survey Says
Daily dosage limits will be based on the strength of the opioid and CVS pharmacists will require the use of immediate-release formulations of opioids before extended-release opioids are dispensed, lowering the risk of tolerance to the highly addictive drugs.
Related: Opioid Prescriptions Are Down But Not Enough, CDC Finds
CVS — which was the first large retail pharmacy chain to stop selling cigarettes in 2014 — is now hoping to help curb the opioid epidemic in the United States. One in three Americans, or 91.8 million Americans used opioid pills in 2015, according to a recent survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. More than 15,000 people died from prescription opioid overdose in 2015, according to the CDC.
With counseling on secure storage and disposal of opioid pills, the CVS pharmacists may be able to limit easy access to the pills. Five percent of adults surveyed told the National Institute on Drug Abuse researchers they took opioids without their doctor’s permission, often getting the prescription meds for free from friends or relatives. The CVS drug disposal collection program will expand to 1,550 units, with the addition of kiosks at 750 retail pharmacies nationwide, adding to 800 units previously donated to law enforcement.
In addition, CVS has pledged to increase its commitment to community health centers by bolstering contributions to medication-assisted treatment programs by $2 million.
The CVS announcement comes on the heels of a special publication released by the National Academy of Medicine, ""First, Do No Harm,"" which calls on the leadership and action of doctors to help reverse the “course of preventable harm and suffering from prescription opioids.”
“Simply restricting access to opioids without offering alternative pain treatments may have limited efficacy in reducing prescription opioid abuse,” said representatives from NIDA. But the move is a major part of the multi-dimensional solution needed to conquer opioid abuse and a long awaited step in the right direction.",0

"Midway Atoll, North Pacific Ocean (CNN) -- The distance from humanity yawns out in front of you when you stand on the pale sands of this tiny Pacific island.
Midway Atoll is just about the furthest piece of land from civilization and its constant engine whir, data and jostle.
Standing on the island's remote shoreline brings a calm and humility -- until you look down at your feet.
On the beach lies a motorcycle helmet, a mannequin's head, an umbrella handle, and a flip-flop. They didn't fall from a plane or off a ship, and there aren't any civilians living here who could have left them behind.
They were washed in with the tide, most likely from China or the US, thousands of miles away -- part of an enormous plastic garbage patch, spinning in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, which you probably contribute to. And these are just the bits of it we can see.
Plastic has become a vital part of our lives of convenience. Yet the coffee cup lids, water bottles and bags we use once and throw away do end up somewhere -- in landfills, but also in the ocean.
Nearly every piece of plastic ever made still exists today. More than five trillion pieces of plastic are already in the oceans, and by 2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish, by weight, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.
Some 8 million tons of plastic trash leak into the ocean annually, and it's getting worse every year. Americans are said to use 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour.
Nothing is an emergency until you feel the burn, or see the red lights. Here plastic's impact is staring you in the face.
Midway is out of sight, but again it is on the front line. Once home to the decisive battle that turned World War Two in favor of the US in the Pacific, it's now locked in a new fight.
The smell of decay
You have to fly to Midway at night. Only then do the millions of birds that swarm the island in high season vacate the runway. We could only get here with permission from the US government and the help of a private jet.
The smell hits you first, and catches in your throat. It's the whiff of decay, of thousands of birds' bodies rotting. Part of this is nature: CNN visited the island in June -- the time of year when the Laysan albatross lay their chicks, who must learn to fly, or die.
But part of it is man-made: When you tear open the fragile ribcages of the birds who did not survive -- as US Fish and Wildlife Service Superintendent Matthew Brown did in front of us -- the sheer volume of plastic waste now in our world becomes apparent.
Inside the slight skeleton of one albatross, we found bottle tops and a cigarette lighter amongst seemingly endless tiny shards of plastic. It's as if plastic actually was the bird's diet.
These brightly colored plastic fragments were picked out of the sea by the bird's parents, who mistook them for food, then fed them to their offspring. The birds can't digest the plastic pieces but they still feel full, which causes malnutrition and death, according to researchers. Volunteers here have an almost full-time job scooping up the corpses.
kilograms of plastic have entered the ocean since you started reading
They have tried to clean Midway up; the huge dump of plastic trash sitting on the runway awaiting collection by boats is evidence of that. But it's almost impossible because so much washes ashore daily -- not to mention the five tons the birds fly onto the island inside in their stomachs each year, according to Brown.
The Eastern Island is now littered with tiny fragments of plastic. The birds die and decay, but the plastic inside them stays forever in the sand -- a layer of man's doing that will never go away. Midway will probably vanish under rising ocean levels before the plastic decays.

""These are the classic 'canary in the coal mine' scenarios,"" said Brown.
""This is an animal that relies entirely on the ocean for its survival, just like 3 billion people do. If their children, their chicks, are being impacted by plastic this much, it is simply a forbearer of what is coming for us.""
From fish to plate
So much of the damage is on the edge of the invisible. If you kneel down on Midway and stick your hand into the hot sand, you can pull up a troubling multicolored array of particles.
These are what activists call the ""new sand"" -- plastic that has broken down into smaller and smaller pieces, and then become part of the shoreline.
Are you eating your own toothbrush?
Your toothbrush is one of many everyday items made of plastic. Most plastics are made from oil.
Plastic production has surged in the past 50 years and could double again by 2036.
15 million tons in 1964
311 million tons in 2014
612 million tons in 2036
Billions of toothbrushs are thrown away every year.
But less than 14% of plastics are recycled globally.
At least 8 million tons of plastic enters our oceans each year - that's one garbage truck a minute.
More than 5 trillion pieces of plastic are in our oceans, weighing 269,000 tons - the same as 3,585 blue whales.
By 2050, there may be more plastic in our oceans than fish.
Most plastic doesn't biodegrade - it breaks down into smaller pieces, which attracts toxins...
You could be ingesting up to 11,000 pieces of microplastic each year - and the toxins that come with them.
Sources: Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Lisbeth Van Cauwenberghe
These smaller particles are what end up in the food chain. The smallest ones, called nano-plastics, sink deep into the ocean and can end up in plankton. Larger pieces, known as micro-plastics, float in a soup, suspended in water, and are eaten by fish. The fish then get eaten by ""apex predators"" higher up the food chain -- including humans, or the Hawaiian Monk Seal.
We don't know as much as we want to about what plastic has done to these seals -- they're endangered, so there are restrictions on opening them up for study by scientists. But there are already troubling signs.
Jessica Bohlander, a marine biologist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says the seals are acting as a ""sentinel for exposure to plastics and other persistent organic pollutants for humans.""
""A few individual animals we have seen have very high levels [of micro-plastics], particularly in adult males,"" she said.
Bohlander says plastic ingestion could be causing reproductive problems for the seals -- and the bigger the animal, the bigger the concentration of plastic.
""It is very troubling,"" she said. ""With every step of the food chain, the concentration that can be measured in the tissues of animals becomes magnified.""
11,000 pieces of plastic each year
Seafood is essential to human life, but there is growing evidence that fish may prefer eating plastic to food.
Swedish scientists recently demonstrated that larval Perch raised in waters containing micro-plastics ""only ate plastic and ignored their natural food source of free-swimming zooplankton.""
This diet of plastic stunted growth rates, reduced hatching rates, and caused abnormal behaviors in the young fish, according to the study.
There's also evidence that plastic is harmful to humans. The US government says styrene -- one of the key ingredients in plastic -- is probably a human carcinogen. It is studying the effects of plastic litter on marine life and plans to launch an inquiry into the effects on human health, including fetal formation.
One study found that man-made marine debris may cause ""physical harm"" to humans when ingested via seafood. Another estimated that Europeans who eat shellfish could be exposed to 11,000 pieces of micro-plastic each year.
What science hasn't proven yet is whether the plastic in the fish we eat directly damages our health. But it's getting there, and the case for real government concern is growing.
And Midway, just by dint of its own distance and damage, is making that case.
Matthew Brown told me he eats sushi much less than he used to.
""Plastics also attract other contaminants, so if you are eating food that has little bits of blue and red in there, these are attracting ... other contaminants in the ocean. This has a real impact on our primary food source.""
The choice the world has made
We took a boat out from the island, towards the coral reef that surrounds it. There, you can feel the awesome power of nature.
Caught in the reef nearby was a sight far more troubling than the bottles we had seen float past us on the water. In one inlet was a soup of tiny white pellets. A huge piece of Styrofoam packaging had been caught, now bobbing and slowly breaking down. In its thick soup was a bottle-top, a feather, and other gunk. You could swim into it easily, let your head emerge up in its midst.
Signs of resilience and defiance in nature abounded, but in one corner, man's carelessness had occupied a visible space and, perhaps for longer, an invisible one. We simply do not know what we have already done.
The hardest part about the journey to Midway is the sense of powerlessness it leaves you with. The damage there began with choices -- and litter -- made decades ago. And the problem is growing, not shrinking, as humanity gets more environmentally aware.
Stopping this flow of trash would require an incredible change in the daily behavior of 7 billion people.
China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka are considered the five worst offenders when it comes to plastic pollution, according to a study published in Science, and you can anticipate as much success telling people there to stop using disposable plastics as you would do in the US. Road test the phrase: ""I'm sorry, you can't have that coffee as you haven't brought your own reusable cup.""
kilograms of plastic have entered the ocean since you started reading
So what can you do? Very little, unless we all do it. You can start by bringing water bottles to work, or a reusable fork to the caf, or insisting on less packaging for products.
For now, the balance of convenience versus the likely risk to human health is in the favor of the coffee cup. If the science isn't there yet, public opinion won't be either.
There is a tiny glimmer of hope amidst this looming disaster, one I often heard while talking to researchers, one that shows people can change.
It's a recent example of something so glaringly, obviously bad for the planet -- and people -- that for centuries was accepted as a normal part of our happy, modern world.
Remember smoking? We don't do that as much anymore.

Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, introduces the new iPhone X during a special event at the Steve Jobs Theater in September in Cupertino, Calif. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  If you're planning on getting an iPhone X in time for the holidays, you may have a harder time getting your hands on one than usual, according to analysts. SeveralApple analysts have said thatthe number of people who wantaniPhone X will far outstrip the number of phones available at launch — and even well into 2018. Daniel Ives of GBH Insights said this week that he thinks it could be April or even May before the balance between supplyanddemand settles and people simply will be able to walk into a store and buy one. “Based on our analysis, survey work, and pent up demand we believe preorder demand could top 40 million units of iPhone X roughly 'doubling' current supply,” Ives said in a note this week to investors. The potential for a longer wait, analysts say, is due to how complicated the iPhone X is to make. Between the new type of screen and the new facial-recognition sensors, Apple is having to deal with a different set of components than usual. The imbalance between supply and demand isexpected to be pretty large: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities predicts that Apple will have 2 million or 3 million phones ready when they hit stores on Nov. 3.
In its holiday quarter in 2016, Apple sold 74.5 million iPhones — keep in mind that there was no iPhone X-like phone last year and that the iPhone 7 was considered a modest seller,because ofincremental upgrades. Demand for the iPhone X is thanks to its advanced facial recognition, a new type of screen anda new depth-sensing camera.The phone willalso be able to use the facial-recognition technology for payments. Other features include wireless charging, which is also available on the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, and the addition of “Portrait Mode” to the front-facing camera. (That means better selfies, of course.) The anticipation for the iPhone X, which will start at $999, has softened sales of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as customers wait to compare the models, a trend that analysts started noting after those phones launchedlastmonth.A September-October surveyfrom 451 Research found that 69 percent of consumers were interested in buying an iPhone in the next 90 days — the highest number the firmhas recorded since Apple redesigned the iPhone 6 in 2014, to havea larger screen. The iPhone X opens for preorder on Friday online at 3:01 a.m. Eastern time andwill be on sale in stores aweek later. If you want to land an iPhone X in time for the holidays, then it's best to try to get in on the first rush of orders. In other words, plan your shopping a bit earlier than you would in other years — at least, if you want to avoidwrapping up an IOU instead of an iPhone X.

"As Europe opts to publicly support genetically modified crops, Russia, who banned GMO’s in 2016, has been ramping up its production and export of organic food.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans back in 2015 to make Russia the largest supplier of healthy, ecologically clean and high-quality food which Western producers “have long lost.”
An EU court ruled last week that Italy could not ban the cultivation of an EU-approved genetically modified crop.
“Recently the organic food market has definitely expanded in Russia. The organically produced food industry held a market valuation of $178 million in 2015, an increase from 2010’s $116 million total,” economist Iryna Kobuta at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia told RT.
“Euromonitor has also noticed increased spending on pre-packaged organic food and drink in Russia. 2015 saw consumers purchase close to $12 million worth of packaged eco-foods. Russia exports organic buckwheat, millet, alfalfa, flax, and wildly grown products – including wild berries, mushrooms, cedar nuts, and herbs – to a variety of countries. Russia also exports organic wheat to the EU,” she added.
In 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to make the country the largest supplier of healthy, ecologically clean and high-quality food which Western producers “have long lost.”
While Russia already has a significant share of the European market at around $2 billion, or 11.8 percent of Russia’s overall agricultural exports, there are obstacles in increasing that share, admits Kobuta.
“The main obstacles to increasing exports of agri-food goods to the EU market are non-conformity with EU food safety requirements, small tariff import quotas applied by EU for agricultural goods, infrastructural and regulatory issues. With regards to the export of organic products, in Russia there is no official certification system or certifying agency,” the economist said.
Due to lack of proper regulation in Russia, local producers keen to operate in organic food have to obtain official certification from third parties like the United States or the EU, to label their products as officially certified bio or organic, and be able to export them outside Russia, Kobuta said.
The draft law “On the Production of Organic Agricultural Products and Amendments to Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation” has not yet been adopted. However, the situation has improved after Russia adopted the national standard for organic products, she added.",1

"Pope Francis has announced controversial plans to revise the English wording of the Lord’s Prayer so that includes references to Satan.
According to Francis, the prayer erroneously asks God to “lead us not into temptation.” The pontiff claims that the wording should be altered to include Lucifer to make it clear that God is not who led humans to sin.
Theguardian.com reports:He told the TV2000 channel: “It is not a good translation because it speaks of a God who induces temptation.”
He added: “I am the one who falls; it’s not him pushing me into temptation to then see how I have fallen.
“A father doesn’t do that, a father helps you to get up immediately. It’s Satan who leads us into temptation, that’s his department.”
The 80-year-old also highlighted that the Catholic church in France had adapted the prayer, and uses the phrase “do not let us fall into temptation” instead.
Thetwo versions of the Lord’s Prayermost commonly used in England both say “lead us not into temptation”.
“I’m not aware of any plans to change the translation in the English-speaking world but you can certainly see the logic of doing so,” said Austen Ivereigh, the pope’s biographer.
“It is not God who tempts us into sin but the enemy of human nature. But tradition and familiarity are also important factors in weighing up any decision to modify a translation.”
The Rev Ian Paul, an Anglican theologian, said the pope’s comments would make traditionalists nervous.
“The word in question ispeirasmos[from New Testament Greek] which means both to tempt and to be tested. So on one level the pope has a point. But he’s also stepping into a theological debate about the nature of evil.
“In terms of church culture, people learn this prayer by heart as children. If you tweak the translation, you risk disrupting the pattern of communal prayer. You fiddle with it at your peril.”
The Lord’s Prayer, which is memorised by millions of Christians across the world, appears in the Bible.",1
"From Before It’s News (source link): Why isn’t the main stream media covering this incident? In our opinion, if they were interested in scaring the pant off of us, they would be playing this video 24/7 on CNN and Foxnews.
Watching this video sent chills through our bones. What if you were on an airplane & the “guys in the blue ebola suits” came aboard? Regardless of your opinion or thoughts on Ebola, the audio and video of this incident is gripping. People are obviously concerned and interested, as the video has received well over 1 million views at the time of this posting.
US Airways pulls passenger from plane who yelled ‘I have Ebola’
As Ebola panic grips the world, a US Airways flight from Philadelphia to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, was detained after landing Wednesday after a passenger sneezed then yelled “I have Ebola, you are all screwed.”
The 54-year-old man reportedly also screamed “I have been to Africa,” according to Gawker, which cites Dominican news site Diario Libre and Fox News as its sources.
Flight 850 was boarded by men in blue hazmat suits, who escorted the man off the plane as nearly everyone on board shot video of the incident on their mobile phones. Passengers, which included at least one baby, were reportedly kept on the plane for two hours after landing.
Just before the hazmat team entered the plane, the flight attended tried to reassure passengers that things would look worse than they were. She also called the sneezing passenger “an idiot.”
“The director of operations of the airport in Punta Cana confirmed a medical team boarded the plane in hazmat suits and took the passenger to a separate medical health area, where he was examined and found not to have the lethal disease,” Gawker reports. “The Ministry of Public Health also confirmed the scare was a false alarm.”
The man reportedly had not been to Africa. He is being returned to the U. S., where he will be checked for Ebola a second time.",1
"According to the nowpublicly available transcriptof the testimony that former U. S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin gave before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) on March 11, 2010, he was not put under oath, despite the fact that the bank at which he had served as Chairman of its Executive Committee for a decade, Citigroup, stood at the center of the financial crisis and received the largest taxpayer bailout in U.S. history.
The fact that Rubin was not put under oath might have had something to do with the fact that he showed up with a team of six lawyers from two of the most powerful corporate law firms in America: Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and Williams & Connolly. One of Rubin’s lawyers from Paul, Weiss was Brad Karp,the lawyer who has gotten Citigroup out of serial fraud charges in the past.
As one reads the transcript, it becomes alarmingly apparent that a man making $15 million a year at Citigroup for almost a decade has not involved himself in very many intricate details of how the firm is being run or has a very selective memory. (Rubin gave up his $14 million annual bonus when the bank was blowing up during the financial crisis but kept his $1 million salary. According to widely circulated estimates, Rubin’s total compensation for his decade at Citigroup was over $120 million, for a job which he concedes included no operational role and with just two secretaries reporting to him.)
To many of the questions posed by Tom Greene, Executive Director of the FCIC, Rubin responded “I don’t remember.” Rubin used that phrase 41 times during the interview.
At one point, Rubin’s own lawyer, Brad Karp, appears to nudge Rubin on his failing memory. Greene asks Rubin if he attended a tutorial for the Board of Directors on September 17, 2007 on the risk environment. Rubin answers as follows: “It is interesting. I don’t remember either going or not going.”Karp then says to Rubin: “Bob, they have the minutes of this meeting.”

"Michelle and Barack Obama have worked hard to keep the details of their daughters’ lives hidden from the public. So they probably weren’t pleased this week when an article was released exploring their 18-year-old daughter’s net worth.
MorningLedger reported that Malia and her sister Sasha have $200,000 and $450,000 in 529 college plans—and it looks like they will need it. The first presidential daughter graduated from the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D. C. and will be taking a gap year before studying at Harvard University.
According to the source, Malia’s net worth is difficult to track. She has been working in the film and TV industry since before she could drive.
Of course, her father’s wealth is much easier to uncover. As the current president, Barack Obama earns $400,000 a year. Celebrity Net Worths estimates he is worth $12.2 million—but that is not entirely accurate given that he receives book royalties, has investments, and accrues monetary awards and prizes. In fact, his upcoming memoir is predicted to earn $20 million, and the Nobel Peace Prize alone earned him $1.4 million.
Barack is the breadwinner, but sadly, Michelle is not far behind. She likely offers $11.8 million in her books, investments, and assets.
Taking all their earnings together, the Obama family has more than a $23 million net worth.
It looks like their lavish lifestyles will continue even after they leave the White House…but at least they will be reaching into their own pockets, instead of ours.",1
"Brutal ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been badly injured in an air strike, according to reports.
The strike, by the US-led coalition, took place in Al-Ba’aj in northern Iraq.
The town is one of the few remaining large ISIS bastions in Iraq after Mosul and Tal Afar.
The incident, which has yet to be independently verified, would come as a huge blow to the jihadi group, which is being beaten back by allied forces across the Middle East.
Last month the US government increased the bounty for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from $10 million to $25 million.
The reward will be handed to anyone who comes forward with information on the whereabouts of the terrorist that leads to his capture or death.
A Facebook and Twitter account belonging to the US Central Command confirmed the reward had been increased.
al-Baghdadi is now worth the same amount of money (20 million) as the leader of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri.
Iraq-born al-Baghdadi sleeps underground in a suicide vest and is becoming increasingly paranoid, ordering executions whilst under attack from Iraqi and Peshmerga troops.
Chilling details of Baghdadi’s movements emerged as Iraqi and Kurdish sources confirmed officers were getting leaks from within Mosul from an undercover agent.

"If you're lucky enough to win the estimated $375 million Powerball, there's one thing you need to do right away: pause.
Even before you claim your winnings after the 10:59 p.m. ET Wednesday drawing, it's smart to assemble a team of experts.
The experts should include a lawyer, an accountant and a financial planner, said certified financial planner Joshua Mungavin, a principal and wealth manager at Evensky & Katz / Foldes Financial in Coral Gables, Florida. They can help you make decisions like whether to establish a blind trust or other entity to claim your winnings anonymously, and offer advice on taking the payout as a lump sum or annuity.
""There needs to be some consideration of what letting the world know you won the lottery will mean for your life,"" he said.
Put the money in a savings account or certificate of deposit, and leave it there for at least a few months, said certified financial planner Hans-Christian Winkler, an independent advisor with ClaraPhi Advisory Network in New York.
""Emotions range up, down, sideways, and when you're emotional, excited, you tend to make the wrong decisions,"" he said. ""Let it sink in.""
That pause gives you an opportunity to think through all your aims for that money, and prioritize those goals and purchases. Taxes — and oh boy, will there be taxes — can also take a big bite out of your windfall, and it's smart to plan for that bill from the outset.
Lottery site USAMega.com estimates the federal tax withholding on the $235.4 million lump sum would be $58.85 million, and state taxes could knock out up to another $20.76 million (with New York the worst offender). Those figures are just the amounts withheld up front; your final tax burden is likely to be even higher.",0
"Story highlights
Tensions between the US and North Korea are high
In 1962, the US and Soviet Union faced off over nuclear weapons
The 13-day standoff became known as the Cuban missile crisis
(CNN)The tension between North Korea and much of the rest of the world over the communist country's reported nuclear capabilities is, objectively, not great. It evokes another famous standoff between the US and communist powers: The Cuban missile crisis.
After the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, relations had only grown colder between the US and communist allies Cuba and the Soviet Union. In an attempt to deter the US from attempting another invasion, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro planned to bring Soviet nuclear missiles to Cuba.
While President Donald Trump has thus far kept his remarks regarding North Korea short, they've packed a punch. When Kennedy chose to address the nation on October 22, 1962, regarding Soviet missile sites being constructed in Cuba, he took a slightly more verbose approach.
You can view part of his speech in the Instagram video above. Intelligence had started coming in days earlier, marking the beginning of the crisis behind the scenes. Kennedy's speech made it the public's collective nightmare.

What if the Cuban Missile Crisis led to war? 02:44
""It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union,"" Kennedy said.
Read More
Trump promised ""fire and fury"" if North Korea threatened the United States, and while he wasn't as alliterative, Kennedy was without question serious.
Nuclear weapons in Cuba meant that Miami was geographically closer to nukes than it is to Tallahassee. At the time, the US had missiles in Turkey, which made Russia feel threatened. There was no obvious way to de-escalate the tension.
Kennedy ordered a naval ""quarantine"" of military equipment. Along the same lines, the United Nations recently put economic sanctions on North Korea.
Kennedy also ordered more surveillance, called for bolstered defenses at Guantanamo Bay and asked Khrushchev to stop threatening the US. As is often the case, asking firmly didn't do much. The Soviets called the quarantine aggressive and accused the US of meddling. A US reconnaissance plane was shot down over Cuba, and the military eventually went to DEFCON 2.
By October 28, after several tense written exchanges and a secret meeting between Attorney General Robert Kennedy and the Soviet ambassador, the conflict was solved diplomatically. The US promised not to invade Cuba and the Soviets promised to take their missiles back. Privately, the US also agreed to pull its Jupiter missiles from Turkey, which had been demanded by the Soviets, though the missiles were due to be pulled anyway.
The threat of nuclear war, for good reason, makes tensions run incredibly high. While there are very few exact details that map out onto both the Cuban Missile Crisis and the current concerns about North Korea, the same fear runs through both.
Perhaps a reminder that these situations can be solved through very terse letters -- although probably not tweets -- is something everyone needs right now.",0

WAKE UP AMERICA: Mexico Ranked Second Deadliest Country in the World",1
"Facts:
The suspects were tried in a Scottish court at Camp Zeist, a former US air base 20 miles south of the Dutch capital of Amsterdam. The Dutch declared 30 acres of the 100-acre base Scottish territory so that the trial could be held in a neutral country as al Megrahi, Fhimah and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi had wanted. There was no jury; three Scottish judges presided, with a fourth as reserve.
Authorities said al Megrahi and Fhimah manufactured the bomb out of Semtex plastic explosives, concealed it in a Toshiba cassette recorder, hid the recorder in a Samsonite suitcase and slipped the suitcase aboard an Air Malta flight headed from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany. The unaccompanied bag is believed to have been transferred to a Pan Am flight to London and then to Flight 103.
The CIA and FBI said the suspects, employed by Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta, were also Libyan intelligence agents. Lesser charges of conspiracy to murder and violating Britain's 1982 Aviation Security Act were dropped.
Over three years, investigators from the United States, Britain, Germany and other countries questioned more than 15,000 people in more than 30 countries and collected thousands of pieces of evidence.
The death penalty is not permitted under Scottish law. There is no prescribed punishment for a conviction of conspiracy to murder. Any punishment is at the discretion of the court. Life imprisonment is the prescribed punishment for murder or contravention of the Aviation Security Act 1982. Any prison sentence would be served in Scotland.

"Unapproved genetically modified wheat has been discovered growing in the United States.
The revelation is threatening the outlook for U. S. exports of the world’s biggest traded food commodity, with importers keenly aware of consumer sensitivity to gene-altered food.
The European Union is preparing to test incoming shipments, and will block any containing GM wheat. Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures fell 0.5 percent on Thursday.
Major importer Japan has cancelled a tender offer to buy U. S. western white wheat, while other top Asian wheat importers South Korea, China and the Philippines said they were closely monitoring the situation.
‘We will refrain from buying western white and feed wheat effective today,’ Toru Hisadome, a Japanese farm ministry official in charge of wheat trading said.
GM wheat was discovered this spring on a farm in the west coast state of Oregon, in a field that grew winter wheat in 2012.
USDA officials said yesterday that when a farmer sprayed the so-called ‘volunteer’ plants with a glyphosate herbicide, some of them unexpectedly survived.
Scientists found the wheat was a strain field-tested from 1998 to 2005 and deemed safe before St. Louis-based biotech giant Monsanto withdrew it from the regulatory approval process on worldwide opposition to genetically engineered wheat.
No GM wheat varieties are approved for general planting in the U. S. or elsewhere, the USDA said.
The EU has asked Monsanto for a detection method to allow its controls to be carried out.
With high consumer wariness to genetically-modified food, few countries allow imports of such cereals for direct human consumption. However, the bulk of U. S. corn and soybean crops are genetically modified
The latest finding revives memories of farmers unwittingly planting genetically modified rapeseed in Europe in 2000, while in 2006 a large part of the U. S. long-grain rice crop was contaminated by an experimental strain from Bayer CropScience , prompting import bans in Europe and Japan.
The company agreed in court in 2011 to pay $750 million to growers as compensation.
Asia imports more than 40 million tonnes of wheat annually, almost a third of the global trade of 140-150 million tonnes. The bulk of the region’s supplies come from the United States, the world’s biggest exporter, and Australia, the No. 2 supplier.
The USDA said there was no sign that genetically engineered wheat had entered the commercial market, but grain traders warned the discovery could hurt export prospects for U. S. wheat.
‘Asian consumers are jittery about genetically modified food,’ said Abah Ofon, an analyst at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore. ‘This is adding to concerns that already exist on quality and availability of food wheat globally.’
European traders said Black Sea and EU wheat was well positioned to benefit in any displaced demand for U. S. grain. But some were more pragmatic on the overall impact.
‘The market is going to need U. S. wheat, we won’t be able to do without it, so that could mean more checks and more sanitary certificates,’ one European dealer said.
‘Japan is in a position to be selective and to react sharply. It has other suppliers and the financial means to be choosy and pay more if needed. This is not necessarily the case for (top global wheat importer) Egypt which is in a difficult financial situation.’
A major flour miller in China, which has been stocking U. S. wheat in recent months, said importers will tread carefully.
China has emerged as a key buyer of U. S. wheat this year, taking around 1.5 million tonnes in the past two months.
Chinese purchases in the year to June 2014 are estimated to rise 21 percent to 3.5 million tonnes, according to the USDA, with most shipments coming from the United States, Australia and Canada.
The Philippines, which buys about 4 million tonnes of wheat a year and relies mainly on U. S. supplies, is waiting for more details before acting, an industry official in Manila said.
‘I won’t be surprised if other countries start cancelling or reducing their purchases of U. S. wheat, particularly Asian countries, putting pressure on wheat demand,’ said Joyce Liu, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.
Genetically modified crops cannot be grown legally in the United States unless the government approves them after a review to ensure they pose no threat to the environment or to people.
Monsanto in a statement posted on its website said: ‘While USDA’s results are unexpected, there is considerable reason to believe that the presence of the Roundup Ready trait in wheat, if determined to be valid, is very limited.’",1
"CERN’s Large Hadron Collider is in full hunting mode for the next three years looking to probe into atomic particles by smashing them together and dissecting the results.
After a temporary shut-down for two years and an upgrade, the world’s largest particle collider is back in business, smashing atoms together with almost double the energy used in its first run.
It is generally looking for new particles to build upon existing scientific theories, and to give legitimacy to modern science and the creation of the universe through the Big Bang, which made it appear out of no-where within no-time.
The universe has been around for nearly 14 billion years in time and the space it occupies (Universe) is filled with mysteries. One of these mysteries for which CERN was created is to do with that space and the matter in that space and for that matter, the action of gravity among the matter in that space (Universe), which remain the fundamental questions in science. Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton have only revealed to us the existence of such fundamental forces and energies.
Still, 90% of the universe is not defined by the present laws of physics. What scientists refer to as dark matter to explain the actions of far away galaxies by astronomers, or the loss of energy when smashing particles together, as in CERN’s quest, is just that 90% of the unknown.
One thing that is known by the 10% that we do know is that creating mini black holes or extra dimensions at CERN could be the most foolish thing that we do. Just to keep the present modern global scientific establishment in business we might blow up the world. It might be better to rethink the present inadequate science and its dangerous research projects, and admit that we are in the dark when faced with dark matter.
We cannot define dark matter. We are dark matter (according to the standard model, by a ratio of 9:1). Dark matter is what allows us to define the 10%. It is the key to understanding the universe, matter and gravity. It could have nothing to do with the speed of light or matter, but gives legitimacy to light by its dark (unknown) existence.
Let us take another look at ourselves and our utter lack of understanding in many fields, including the new science.
Scientists claim that the experiments at CERN are safe because they occur naturally above the earth’s atmosphere. But in space there is no one watching.
In particle physics as in the physics of light, there is a peculiarity which should stop scientists theorising any further, just momentarily. The path or direction that light takes, or the interaction among particles in the subatomic world, depend upon the Presence/or Not, of a human observer or even a camera.
In CERN the place is full of cameras and human eyes monitoring events.
The European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, said the Large Hadron Collider will now run around the clock for the next three years, producing vast amounts of data for scientists to scour.
‘We have seen the first data beginning to flow,’ said CERN’s director, Rolf Heuer. ‘Let’s see what they will reveal to us about how our universe works.’
The collider underwent a $150 million upgrade after its first run, which produced results that helped confirm the existence of an elusive subatomic particle, the Higgs boson.
Heuer said physicists hope the new run might lead to discoveries that could help ‘explain remaining mysteries such as dark matter.’
The LHC, located in a 27-kilometer (16.8-mile) tunnel beneath the Swiss-French border, is now smashing together protons at 13 trillion electronvolts.
Nobody knows quite what the LHC might reveal with its new particle collisions – mini-versions of the Big Bang primordial blast that brought the universe into being 13.8 billion years ago – but scientists hope it will produce evidence of what has been dubbed ‘new physics’.
This concept includes ‘dark matter’, thought to make up some 96 percent of the stuff of the universe while being totally invisible, and super-symmetry, or SUSY, under which all visible particles have unseen counterparts.
‘The only thing we really know is that there is ‘new physics’ because the model that we have is not complete,’ said Luca Malgeri, a scientist working at the European physics research centre CERN.
‘It might be linked to dark matter or it might not. It might be linked to something totally new.’
If there is a particle missing from current knowledge of the building blocks of the universe, CERN scientists hope that it might be spotted, even fleetingly, in the debris of the billions of collisions, just as the Higgs boson was.
The first results might come early, Malgeri said, because the LHC already searched for smaller particles on its previous run, and a bigger particle might show up quickly, if high energy collisions are the key to its existence.
It may have extremely weak interaction with other forces, which might explain why it had never been observed before.
The CERN scientists would hope to detect any dark matter by noticing that some energy was missing after the collision, which would betray the existence of such a particle, Malgeri said.
If the hoped-for particle is only created very rarely, it may take many more collisions to find it, which is why the number of collisions – the LHC’s ‘luminosity’ – will increase over the next three years until it is 10 times brighter than on its first run.
Whether anything will be observed, however, is anybody’s guess.
‘This is the million dollar question,’ Malgeri said.
‘We are wide open. After the first run of the LHC, all possibilities are equally probable for new physics.’
When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery.
If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don’t add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing.
From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force.
Called ‘dark matter’, this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe.",1
"Noticing how many scandals are being exposed lately?
A massive leak of more than 13m files reveals the hidden wealth of some of the world’s richest people including sports stars, celebrities and heads of state. The Paradise Papers show how complex schemes set up in offshore islands can help the super-rich avoid billions in tax
A leak of more than 13 million documents pertaining to wealth stored in offshore tax havens has revealed information on tens of thousands of the world’s wealthiest companies and people, including high-profile figures from U. S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, to the Queen of England.
A leak of more than 13 million documents pertaining to wealth stored in offshore tax havens has revealed information on tens of thousands of the world’s wealthiest companies and people, including high-profile figures from U. S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, to the Queen of England.
The documents — tagged as “Paradise Papers” — were obtained by German newspaperSüddeutsche Zeitungand shared with almost 100 media partners around the world by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), an international consortium of journalists.
The scale of the leak rivals that of last year’sPanama Papers,which laid bare 11.5 million financial documents for public scrutiny.According tothe ICIJ, that exposé resulted in an estimated $135 billion being wiped off the value of nearly 400 companies, the recuperation of over $110 million worth of unpaid taxes, and at least 150 inquiries, audits or investigations by police, customs, financial crime and mafia prosecutors.
Like its 2016 predecessor, the disclosure of the Paradise Papers sheds light on the complex structures the global elite use to obfuscate their financial dealings. While the use of offshore accounts is not in and of itself illegal, it is sometimes linked to money laundering and tax avoidance.
Here’s what else to know about the Paradise Papers:
The Paradise Papers comprise of 13.4 million files leaked from two offshore service providers and 19 tax havens’ company registries. In the eye of the storm is a law firm called Appleby, which has branches in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. Unlike Mossack Fonseca, the firm at the center of the Panama Papers leak, Appelby is a member of the reputed legal “magic circle” and says it has always operated within the law.
“Appleby has thoroughly and vigorously investigated the allegations and we are satisfied that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, either on the part of ourselves or our clients,” the company said in astatementissued a fortnight before the papers were made public.
Trump’s commerce secretary invested in a Russian firm with links to Putin:When President Donald Trump picked Wilbur Ross as his Commerce Secretary, the 79-year-old divested most of his business interests. But Ross maintains a stake in a NYSE-listed shipping company called Navigator, which has convoluted links to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Since 2014, Navigator — which Ross invests in through a chain of companies in the Cayman Islands — has collected more than $68million for services rendered to Moscow-based gas and petrochemicals giant called Sibur. That company is part-owned by Russia’s youngest billionaire Kirill Shamalov, who also happens to be Vladimir Putin’s son-in-law. Shamalov is not under U. S. sanctions but his father Nikolai, a longtime friend of Putin, is. In 2014, the U.S. and the European Union penalized him in response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and subsequent annexation of Crimea.
In short, the U. S. Commerce Secretary stands to benefit from the operations of a company closely connected to people under U.S. sanctions. Democrats are now saying Rossmisled Congress about the nature of his investments.
In aninterviewwith theGuardian, Daniel Fried, an assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under George W. Bush said that Ross’s connections with “cronies of Putin” threatened to undermine U. S. measures to reign in Russian aggression. “I don’t understand why anybody would decide to maintain this kind of relationship going into a senior government position,” Fried said. “What is he thinking?”
The disclosure comes amid special counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation into allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump administration. Inresponseto questions posed by the New YorkTimes, a spokesman for Ross said the Commerce Secretary had never met the oligarchs behind Sibur and that he “recuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels.” The spokesman added that Ross had been generally supportive the administration’s sanctions of Russian. In a later interview with CNBC, Ross said there was “nothing wrong with anything that was done” and called allegations that he had deceived his stake in Navigator “totally wrong.”
Russian state companies used a business associate of #JaredKushner to invest in U. S. social media:Two Kremlin-linked companies have funneled hundreds of millions of dollars intoFacebookand Twitter through a business associate of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to the leaked documents.
The Paradise Papers show that the financial arm of state-run Gazprom, and Russia’s VTB Bank poured funds into two investment vehicles that in turn purchased about $1billion worth of shares in Facebook and $191 million in shares of Twitter in or around 2011. Those investment vehicles are owned by a Russian technology mogul named Yuri Milner, who also has an $850,000 stake in a startup co-founded by Kushner.
Milner — who has in the past advised the Russian government on technology — denies the U. S. social media giants were made aware the money for his funds’ investments came from Russian state-owned enterprises. In interviews after the publication of the papers he said that VTB Bank’s investment did not buy it influence at Twitter and that he was not aware Gazprom Investholding had backed the Facebook stake. He has also downplayed his relationship with Kushner, saying he had only met the U.S. President’s son-in-law once.
Before initially investing in Facebook in 2009, Milner worked a stint at the World Bank and then established the Russian social media service Mail.ru. The tech entrepreneur, who is a friend of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and attended his California wedding, has lived in the U. S. with his family since 2014.
Facebook and Twitter have pushed back against accusations of lapses in their due diligence. In a statement, Facebooknotedthat the investment vehicle Gazprom used had been a “passive investor” with no voting rights or board seat, and that its stake had been sold five years ago.
The leak comes amid an ongoing investigation into covert Russian meddling the run up to and after the U. S. Presidential Elections. A Senate intelligence hearing last week revealed that Russian electoral disinformation had reached 126 million people on Facebook alone. Senator Dianne Feinstein called the online manipulation of Americans the “beginning of cyberwarfare.”
The Queen of England has investments in a business the exploits poor families in Britain:The private estate of Great Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II has invested millions of pounds inpreviously undisclosed funds based in the Cayman islands and other offshore jurisdictions. Some of that money has boosted the coffers of a business that has been criticized for preying on financially vulnerable families.
The Paradise Papers show that through the Cayman Islands fund, the Duchy of Lancaster — the body responsible for managing the royal investment portfolio — invested an undisclosed sum in a company called BrightHouse. Britain’s largest rent-to-own retailer, BrightHouse supplies goods like TVs and refrigerators to families under a high-cost credit scheme. Earlier this year Britain’s financial regulator said the company had not acted as a “responsible lender” and ordered it to pay 14.8m ($19million) to almost 250,000 customers.
The Duchy of Lancaster invested in BrightHouse in 2005, before the retailer was criticized for exploiting poor families, and said it had no idea it had a stake in the company until it was approached by reporters,accordingto theGuardian. It also denies the British Monarch gained a tax advantage by investing in a Cayman Islands-based fund. Still, the level of oversight the royal estate applies to making sure its investments are ethical, and the use of offshore funds more broadly, is in question.
At the time of its most recent filing in March the duchy reportedly managed 519million ($678million) in assets.
Trudeau’s money man may have used tax havens:The latest disclosuresrevealthat the chief fundraiser to Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau might have shuttled millions of dollars between offshore jurisdictions to legally avoid paying taxes in the U. S., Canada and Israel.
Stephen Bronfman, a scion of one of Canada’s wealthiest families, is accredited with transforming the Liberal Party into a financial juggernaught and propelling Trudeau to its premiership in 2013. Promoted to chief fundraiser for the party, he was instrumental in helping Trudeau win Canada’s 2015 federal election.
But tax experts say that some transactions allegedly undertaken by Bronfman’s private-investment company Claridge may have breached tax rules in using a series of shell companies and other entities to move money around.
A lawyer representing the Bronfman familytoldthe ICIJ and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that “none of the transactions or entities at issue were affected or established to evade or even avoid taxation” and that they “were always in full conformity with all applicable laws and requirements.”
Any “suggestion of false documentation, fraud, ‘disguised’ conduct, tax evasion or similar conduct is false, and a distortion of the facts,” the lawyer added.
A spokesman for Trudeau declined to comment but the revelations about Bronfman could be a political liability for the Prime Minister, whose electioneering platform of reducing inequality and going after tax dodgers had resonated with the Canadian public.",1

"“Shishani is not able to breathe on his own and is using machines. He hasbeen clinically dead for several days,” said Rami AbdelRahman, head of theSyrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Abdel Rahman said the notorious red-bearded commander, known as Omar theChechen, was in a hospital in the northern province ofRaqa, ISIS’s bastion inSyria.
A US official said on March 9 that Shishani “likely died” in a barrage ofUS-led air strikes on March 4 in northeastern Syria.
The official branded Shishani “the ISIL equivalent of the secretary ofdefense,”using another acronym for the group.
Abdel Rahman at the time said the jihadist had been “seriously injured” inthe strike on his convoy, but that he had not died.
Shishani was one of the ISIS leaders most wanted by Washington, which put a$5 million bounty on his head.
Shishani comes from the Pankisi Gorge, a mainly ethnic Chechen region ofex-Soviet state Georgia.
As early as May 2013, when ISIS was just emerging in Syria, he was appointedthe group’s military commander for the north of thecountry.
While Shishani’s exact rank is unclear, Richard Barrett of the US-basedSoufan Group has described him as ISIS’s “most senior militarycommander,”adding that he has been in charge of key battles.
Shishani is not, however, a member of ISIS’s political leadership, astructure that is even murkier than its military command.
The lack of a US presence on the ground makes it difficult to assess thesuccess of operations targeting militants in Syria, and Shishani’sdeath hasbeen falsely reported several times.",1
"Our friends seem to be genetically more similar to us than strangers, according to a new U. S. scientific study led by prominent Greek-American professor of sociology and medicine at Yale University Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler, professor of medical genetics and political science at the University of California.
The researchers, who made the relevant publication in the Journal of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), analyzed the genome of 1,932 people and compared pairs of friends withpairs of strangers. There was no biological affinity amongall these people, but only the difference in the level of social relations between them. The study showed that, on average, every person had a more similar DNA with his friends than with strangers. The researchers noted that this finding has to do with the tendency of people to make friends with similar racial (and hence genetic) background.
The genetic similarity between friends was greater than the expected similarity between people who share a common national and genetic inheritance. It is not clear yet by what mechanisms this occurs. But how similar are we with our friends? On average, according to the study, a friend of ours has a genetic affinity comparable to our fourth cousin, which means that we share about 1% of our genes our friends. “1% does not sound a big deal, but it is for geneticists.
It is noteworthy that most people do not even know who their fourth cousins are, but somehow, fromthe countless possible cases, we choose to makefriends with people who are genetically similar to us,” said ProfChristakis. Christakis and Fowler even developed a “friendship score”, which predicts who will befriend whom with nearly the same accuracy as scientists predict, on the basis of genetic analysis, the chances of a person to obesity or schizophrenia. Focusing on individual genes, the research shows that friends are more likely to have similar genes related to the sense of smell, but different genes that control immunity; thus friends vary genetically in their protection against various diseases.
It seems to be an evolutionary mechanism that serves the society in general,sincethe fact that people hang out with thosewho are vulnerable to different diseases constitutes a barrier to the quickspread of an epidemic from person to person. Another notable finding is that the common genes we share with our friends seem to evolve more rapidly than others.
Prof Christakis explains that probably that is why human evolution seems to have accelerated over the past 30,000 years, as the social environment with an important role of linguistic communication is a vital evolutionary factor. Furthermore, according to the Greek-American scientist, “new research reinforces the notion that humans are “transgenic” beings, not only because of the bacteria that live on/in/around us, but because of the people who surround us. It seems that our capacity depends not only on our genetic composition, but also on the genetic composition of our friends.”",1

""Femme assise, robe bleu,"" a painting by Pablo Picasso, sold for $45 million at a Christie's auction in New York on May 15.
The painting depicts Dora Maar, a photographer, painter, and one of Picasso's lovers. It was created on Picasso's birthday on October 25, 1939.

In 1940, during the German occupation of France, the Nazis confiscated ""Femme Assise, Robe Bleu"" from Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg. According to Christie's, it was transferred to the German embassy in Paris, then a store house for plundered art, before it was packed up to be transferred to Germany, via Nikolsburg, Moravia (part of the modern Czech Republic) in 1944.
French resistance soldiers intercepted the painting -- along with 63 other Picasso artworks -- on a train to Moravia.
While $45 million may seem like a staggering amount, a number of Picasso's works have sold for substantially more. In 2015, his ""Les femmes d'Alger (Version 'O')"" sold for $179 million, setting a new record for an artwork sold at auction, and in 2004, ""Garon à la pipe"" (1905) sold for $104 million.
Last year, ""Femme assise"" (1909), one of Picasso's earliest Cubist paintings, sold for $63.4 million, almost $20 million more than its estimate.
""Femme assise, robe bleu"" was last for sale in 2011, when it sold for $26 million.",0
"(Before It's News)The largest study to date of body sizes over millions of years finds a “pulse and stasis” pattern to hominin evolution, with surges of growth in stature and bulk occurring at different times.

The findings are from the largest study of hominin body sizes, involving 311 specimens dating from earliest upright species of 4.4m years ago right through to the modern humans that followed the last ice age.
While researchers describe the physical evolution of assorted hominin species as a “long and winding road with many branches and dead ends”, they say that broad patterns in the data suggest bursts of growth at key stages, followed by plateaus where little changed for many millennia.
The scientists were surprised to find a “decoupling” of bulk and stature around one and a half million years ago, when hominins grew roughly 10cm taller but would not consistently gain any heft for a further million years, with an average increase of 10-15kgs occurring around 500,000 years ago.
Before this event, height and weight in hominin species appeared to evolve roughly “in concert”, say the authors of this first study to jointly analyse both aspects of body size over millions of years.
“An increase solely in stature would have created a leaner physique, with long legs and narrow hips and shoulders. This may have been an adaptation to new environments and endurance hunting, as early Homo species left the forests and moved on to more arid African savannahs,” says lead author Dr Manuel Will from Cambridge’s Department of Archaeology, and a Research Fellow at Gonville & Caius College.
“The higher surface-to-volume ratio of a tall, slender body would be an advantage when stalking animals for hours in the dry heat, as a larger skin area increases the capacity for the evaporation of sweat.
“The later addition of body mass coincides with ever-increasing migrations into higher latitudes, where a bulkier body would be better suited for thermoregulation in colder Eurasian climates,” he says.
However, Dr Will points out that, while these are valid theories, vast gaps in the fossil record continue to mask absolute truths. In fact, Will and colleagues often had to estimate body sizes from highly fragmented remains – in some cases from just a single toe bone.
The study found body size to be highly variable during earlier hominin history, with a range of differently shaped species: from broad, gorilla-like Paranthropus to the more wiry or ‘gracile’ Australopithecus afarensis. Hominins from four million years ago weighed a rough average of 25kg and stood at 125-130cm.
As physicality morphs over deep time, increasingly converging on larger body sizes, the scientists observe three key “pulses” of significant change.
The first occurs with the dawn of our own defined species bracket, Homo, around 2.2-1.9m years ago. This period sees a joint surge in both height (around 20 cm) and weight (between 15-20kg).
Stature then separated from heft with a height increase alone of 10cm between 1.4-1.6m years ago, shortly after the emergence of Homo erectus. “From a modern perspective this is where we see a familiar stature reached and maintained. Body mass, however, is still some way off,” explains Will.
It’s not until a million years later (0.5-0.4m years ago) that consistently heavier hominins appear in the fossil record, with an estimated 10-15kg greater body mass signalling adaptation to environments north of the Mediterranean.
“From then onwards, average body height and weight stays more or less the same in the hominin lineage, leading ultimately to ourselves,” says Will.
There are, however, a couple of exceptions to this grand narrative: Homo naledi and Homo floresiensis. Recently discovered remains suggest these species swam against the tide of increasing body size through time.
“They may have derived from much older small-bodied ancestors, or adapted to evolutionary pressures occurring in small and isolated populations,” says Will. Floresiensis was discovered on an Indonesian island.
“Our study shows that, other than these two species, hominins that appear after 1.4m years ago are all larger than 140cm and 40kg. This doesn’t change until human bodies diversify again in just the last few thousand years.”
“These findings suggest extremely strong selective pressures against small body sizes which shifted the evolutionary spectrum towards the larger bodies we have today.”
Will and colleagues say evolutionary pressures that may have contributed include ‘cladogenesis’: the splitting of a lineage, with one line – the smaller-bodied one, in this case – becoming extinct, perhaps as a result of inter-species competition.
They also suggest that sexual dimorphism – the physical distinction between genders, with females typically smaller in mammals – was more prevalent in early hominin species but then steadily ironed out by evolution.
Study co-author Dr Jay Stock, also from Cambridge’s Department of Archaeology, suggests this growth trajectory may continue.
“Many human groups have continued to get taller over just the past century. With improved nutrition and healthcare, average statures will likely continue to rise in the near future. However, there is certainly a ceiling set by our genes, which define our maximum potential for growth,” Stock says.
“Body size is one of the most important determinants of the biology of every organism on the planet,” adds Will. “Reconstructing the evolutionary history of body size has the potential to provide us with insights into the development of locomotion, brain complexity, feeding strategies, even social life.”",1

"ESPN – A class action lawsuit was filed Tuesday on behalf of two Las Vegas residents seeking more than $5 million from Manny Pacquiao, his managers and his promoters for fraudulently concealing his injury before his fight against Floyd Mayweather.
The suit alleges that Pacquiao and his manager Michael Koncz, his promotional company Top Rank, and its chairman Bob Arum and its president Todd duBoef, admitted that they knew of his shoulder injury after the fight, but failed to disclose it to the Nevada Athletic Commission as required by law.
They also kept it a secret from fans who bought tickets to the fight, purchase the fight on pay-per-view and bet on the fight.
It is estimated that pay-per-view revenues could top $300 million, and wagers in the state of Nevada alone on the fight could surpass $60 million.
Ticket revenues from the fight were expected to generate $72 million, though only roughly 500 tickets were sold to the public.
Although Saturday’s fight lasted the full 12 rounds, with Mayweather winning by a unanimous decision, the question is whether the fight – advertised as “The Fight of the Century” – was properly promoted or whether it was a fair contest from the start. The plaintiffs argue that it was not, and violated the Nevada Deceptive Trade Practices Act.
“The allegations in this lawsuit are demonstrably false,” said attorney Daniel Petrocelli, who represents Top Rank. “There are documents that explicitly show the medications that Manny was using to treat his shoulder and it was fully disclosed with USADA, which we contracted for the fight.”
Petrocelli said thatPacquiao was examined by doctors before the fight and was proved to be physically able, but re-injured his shoulder during the bout. That the public was unaware ofPacquiao’s original injury is immaterial.
“This is a frivolous lawsuit and we are confident it will be dismissed,” saidPetrocelli.",1

Update: The Democratic National Committee just released its August fundraising numbers. It pulled in a slightly better $4.4 million, but that again ranks among its worst months in recent years. It also yet again saw its debts rise and its net cash decline. When you subtract debt from cash on hand, the committee is now just $2.8 million in the black — down from $3.4 million last month and $8.8 million earlier this year. Its cash on hand dipped slightly from $6.9 million to $6.8 million. For the same month, the Republican National Committee raised $7.3 million and increased its cash on hand to $45.8 million.  The below post is from last month. Tom Perez has been chairman of the Democratic National Committee for about seven months. During that brief tenure, the committee has accounted for three of its 14 worst monthly fundraising reports since Barack Obama was elected president. And its latest month was its worst since Obama was inaugurated more than eight years ago. The DNC has had problems for years, often badly lagging behind the Republican National Committee in fundraising and struggling under the uneven leadership of Debbie Wasserman Schultz until her ouster last year. But even by its own standards, the start of 2017 has been bad. After a strong $12.2 million raised in March — the first full month of Perez's chairmanship — fundraising has dried up considerably. The $4.7 million it raised in April was the lowest for that particular month since 2009. The $4.3 million raised in May was the worst for that month since 2003. And now the $3.8 million raised in July is the worst for any month since January 2009.  On one level, a dropoff of some kind might have been expected; Democrats no longer have an incumbent president to help them raise money, after all.But Democrats also have the benefit of a uniquely powerful political boogeyman to raise money against. And in fact,while the DNC has struggled, House and Senate Democrats' campaign committeeshave actually narrowly outraised their GOP counterparts. Notably, the DNC is alsobleedingmoney rather than building up a war chest with which to fight the 2018 election. The DNC's cash on hand has dropped from more than $10 million when Perez took over to less than $7 million today. The committee has also seen its debts rise to $3.4 million. Combining its cash on hand with its debt, the DNC was $7.4 million in the black shortly after Perez took over at the end of February and is now just $3.4 million in the black. (This is the red “net money” line in the below chart.)  For comparison's sake, here's what the Republican National Committee's balance sheet looks like this year. It has raised at least $9.5 million each month and carries no debt. Its cash on hand has risen from about $37 million in January to $47.1 million today — more than 13 times the net money that the DNC has available.    On top of Perez's ill-advised comments about how Democrats had to support abortion rights a few months ago — something other Democratic leaders quickly rebuffed — it suggests the DNC hasn't really righted the ship after Wasserman Schultz's rocky tenure.

"During the 17 days that 140 million gallons of raw sewage poured from Mexico into the Tijuana River and then into the ocean fronting several popular South San Diego communities, no Mexican official disclosed the potential health and environmental hazards.
Despite the silence when the spill began Feb. 6, some 200,000 people living in South San Diego, Imperial Beach and Chula Vista knew there was something amiss. Even a mile away from the Tijuana River they could smell the eye-watering, throat-burning, overwhelming smell of raw sewage. They’d eventually learn this was the worst sewage spill in the region in a decade.
The spill resulted in several miles of beaches being closed for five to six weeks from the Mexican border north to the city of Coronado. One beach by the border is still closed.
“For San Diego, which is defined by its relationship with the ocean, this kind of massive sewage spill across the border is unacceptable,” U. S. Rep. Scott Peters, a Democrat who represents some of the affected areas, told Fox News. “From surfing, to the Navy and Marine Corps presence, it drives our way of life and large parts of our economy.”
The U. S. International Boundary Water Commission, which operates under the U.S./Mexican Water Treaty of 1944 to oversee sanitation, water quality and flood control in the border region, is investigating the recent sewage spill, and why Mexican wastewater authorities didn’t report it even as sewage was visible in the ocean and beaches.
“We need cooperation on both sides of the border for this investigation to get all of the answers on how this sewage spill happened. Then we can figure out how to apply resources across the border to prevent it from happening again,” Peters said.
Serge Dedina, mayor of Imperial Beach, a working class beach community whose border abuts the Mexican border, said it was frustrating the spill hadn’t been reported, even though it could impact the health of beachgoers, surfers, those using the many trails through South San Diego for biking or hiking and the small business owners that run the many organic farms, ranches and equestrian centers along the border.
“We never had anything like this – such consistent complaints and duration of the stench, so we knew it was a pretty severe problem,” Dedina said to Fox News.
But this isn’t a one-time occurrence -- Dedina deals with the sewage problems that flow from Mexico every single day. A lifelong resident of Imperial Beach, Dedina has been working seriously on the sewage issue since 2004. Since becoming mayor two years ago he has worked daily on the problem. He is considered one of the leading experts on the matter.
“The real issue is that this consistently happens, there is no accountability, there is very little transparency and almost no commitment to fix the problem,” Dedina said.
Mexican sewage flows into the U. S. in two ways. Between 30 and 40 million gallons of sewage are discharged every day ontothe beach from Mexico’s Punta Banderas sewage treatment plant six miles south of the border, and during south swells and south winds, the sewage washes up on U.S. beaches, Dedina said.
“We assume everything is good, and then go in the water, and then realize too late, we are awash in sewage. It is the worst feeling ever,” said Dedina, an avid surfer. “Last summer, we had some of the worst consistent flows of sewage across the border that we ever experienced.”
The second way Mexican sewage flows into the U. S. is from the Tijuana River. About 15 million gallons per day of treated sewage discharged into the Tijuana River, Dedina said.
“There is a diverter pipe in the Tijuana River operated in Mexico just before the border that in theory should be turned on all the time — but if there is an electrical outage or it breaks down, which happens frequently, then the Tijuana River flows into the U. S. and can pollute our beaches,” Dedina said.
The International Boundary and Water Commission reports Mexico has no plans or timeline at all to turn on the diverter pipe, Dedina said, which means the river of treated sewage will flow freely into the U. S.
Border Patrol Agents who work along the Tijuana River have been impacted by the dust and smells. A decade ago, the National Border Patrol Council, which is the exclusive representative of some 2,400 Border Patrol agents, filed a related lawsuit and fought for “hazard pay” for the agents in San Diego.
“We have had have had some complaints from agents about feeling sick or nauseous because of the sewage spill,” confirmed union president Terence Shigg, noting the union could take further when the results of recent environmental tests are returned.
Imperial Beach adjoins Coronado, which has a large military presence. The Navy SEALs used to train in Imperial Beach, but because of health concerns the Navy relocated the training, Dedina said.
Besides being home to the famous big wave surfing spot known as the Tijuana Sloughs, Imperial Beach is surrounded by stunningly beautiful wildlife refuge sanctuaries. But last year when it rained, sewage flooded the estuary and hundreds of leopard sharks, among other sea creatures, died.
Dedina suggests there should be a river management plan, new and upgraded infrastructure and regular river cleanups.
In the last week there has been some good news, Dedina said. The Mexican federal government and the governor of Baja have joined the effort to upgrade the sewage system in Tijuana, which will be funded partly by the U. S. taxpayers through the North American Development Bank and partly by the Mexican federal government.",0
"April 15th. Tax day. No matter how much money you have, it is the one day that you don’t feel like you have enough. Even when you get a refund it comes with the knowledge that those fat cats in Washington have been living it up off of the interest at your expense.
So, the irony was abundant that day this year when I took my middle-class-at-best self to one of the most hoity-toity towns in the world, Greenwich, Connecticut, to drive the most hoity-toity car ever made, the multi-million dollar Bugatti Veyron Super Sport.
This isn’t just a Veyron we’re talking about here - a car that has been with us now for over half a decade - the Super Sport is the ne plus ultra of Veyrons. The ultimate version of the ultimate supercar car ever made. It should’ve been named the Omega.
To refresh your memory: the Veyron sped on to the scene in 2005 powered by quad-turbocharged W16-cylinder engine fed by two fuel pumps that produced 1,001 hp. The Super Sport has 1,200 hp, courtesy of larger turbos providing higher boost pressure and four fuel pumps to keep up with it. That’s the same amount of power found in two 200 mph Bentley Continental GT Speeds, or 10 Ford Fiestas, depending on which economic strata you are coming at this from.
All-wheel-drive remains, as does the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The most visible changes are a front fascia with larger intakes to feed air into some of the 10 radiators that keep the mechanical parts of this beast cool and the replacement of the Veyron’s signature aluminum roof scoops with flush, aircraft-style NACA ducts that reduce aerodynamic drag while helping the engine breathe. A nearly full cowling over the formerly exposed engine compartment completes the exercise in streamlining.
The result? A top speed of 268 mph, which restores the title of World’s Fastest Production Car to the Veyron nameplate. The original’s maximum velocity of 253 mph was surpassed in 2007 by the little-known SSC Aero as it reached 256 mph on a closed public road in its hometown of West Richland, Washington.
Record runs in the Veyron take place at a high-speed test track in Ehra-Lessien, Germany owned by Bugatti’s parent company, Volkswagen. I was reminded of this fact when I buckled into the Super Sport in Greenwich, a town which may hold the world record for 25 mph speed limit signs per capita. Being handed the keys there is kind of like having a supermodel chat you up at an abstinence meeting. You can complain, but you probably won’t.
I’d like to think that it was fitting, however, as many people who buy this car will never achieve the climax of its top speed, either. Rather, they will appreciate it as a priceless possession crafted from the carbon fiber peeking through its clearcoat lacquer– a last seconds of twilight dark blue in this case – that carries with it an air of supremacy unmatched since the invention of the automobile.
The same feeling is inspired by the interior, where minimalist lines wrap two passengers in restrained elegance – as long as the owner has the good sense not to choose Carmine red over Tangerine as the color combination (try out the configurator to see what I mean.) Controls are simplified to the point that a navigation system isn’t even available anymore. Bugatti’s North American head of sales and marketing, John Hill, says that customers simply don’t want it. I imagine they have a good idea where they are going when they take the Veyron out for a spin.
Turn the key, press the console mounted start button and you’re met with a sound that is literally like no other, because there has never been an engine like this before. Over-engineering never sounded so good. Tap the gear selector into Drive, however, and a funny thing happens: not much.
Don’t go out of your way to make it angry, and the Super Sport is as docile as a VW Golf. Unlike supercars of old that need to be tamed every second they are in motion, this one is more like a championship thoroughbred that’s already been broken by your private trainer. But put the spurs to it, and prepare to clench your buttocks.
Find a straight stretch of road to mash the accelerator on and you initiate a war between the drivetrain and the $30,000 set of custom Michelin tires with armistice terms negotiated by an traction control system that makes the Treaty of Versaille look like a bro hug. Each full-throttle shift sends a shockwave through the Veyron that’s punctuated by a pop from the quartet of turbos letting off steam and a split second of blurred vision. This isn't just the world's fastest production car, it's also the quickest.
Fight the urge to keep your right foot planted and you’ll nevertheless find that you are going faster than is advisable, and much faster than you thought that you were. Relative to its top speed, a Super Sport traveling at 100 mph might as well be parked.
It’s the same through turns, where double-digit mph have little or no effect on the reworked suspension. New springs, dampers and stabilizer bars are aimed at increasing the Super Sport’s handling capabilities, but also manage to soak up bumps better than the previous model. Something I’m lucky enough to know, first hand.

Fuel economy? I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that. Let’s just put it this way: at top speed the 26 gallon gas tank will empty in about 12 minutes, but the tires will likely self-destruct in half that time, so, as a reminder that even billionaires are subjects of the nanny state, all but five special edition Super Sports come with a 258 mph limiter. That’s faster than any other car, but just short of the golden ring.
Bugatti has limited total production of the Veyron to just 300 units, the last 30 of which were set to be Super Sports sold at a price of around $2.8 million, but I’m told the run will likely be extended to the final 40 cars. Unknown to my clueless self, the deadline to file taxes was also extended this year to April 18th. Doesn’t really matter, I still can’t afford either of them.

"Phil Mickelson has more than just an elusive U. S. Open title on his mind for 2018. He wants desperately to be on another Ryder Cup team, and he's willing to add tournaments to his schedule if that's what it takes.
Mickelson already holds the U. S. record by qualifying for 11 consecutive teams, and he has made 23 straight appearances in the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup combined. But this isn't about a streak. It's about having a chance — perhaps his last chance — to win a Ryder Cup in Europe.
""That's a big goal of mine, and if I play like I've been playing, I'll make the team,"" Mickelson said at the HSBC Champions in Shanghai.
Whether he speaks from confidence or hope remains to be seen.
Mickelson hasn't won since the 2013 British Open, and the last PGA Tour season was his first without recording a top-3 finish. He plans to start next year at the CareerBuilder Challenge in Southern California and play the entire West Coast from there, followed by the World Golf Championship in Mexico City.
""I'll play more tournaments if I have to,"" he said. ""I'm not sure if I have to add much. Paris is a big goal of mine, and it's important to get off to a good start.""
Mickelson has been on five losing teams held on European soil. There were two close calls. One was in 2002 at The Belfry, when the matches were tied at 8 going into Sunday singles. Europe won the last session, including Phillip Price defeating Mickelson. The other was in Wales, when Graeme McDowell won the final match for a one-point victory.
Mickelson, who turns 48 in June, doesn't see Paris next September as his last chance to win in Europe. Told that he would be 52 the next time the matches go to Europe, Mickelson said, ""I'm not looking that far ahead.""
""I'm expecting to have a good year,"" he said. ""I'd like to get on the team and go over there and win.""
PARK ON TOP: Sung Hyun Park brought plenty of winning experience to her rookie season on the LPGA Tour.
The 24-year-old Park won seven times on the Korean LPGA Tour last year, and facing the best competition in the world hasn't slowed her. Park became the fourth South Korean player to reach No. 1 in the world, and the first player to get there as an LPGA rookie.
""There won't be any changes because of the ranking,"" Park said from China, where she makes her debut at No. 1. ""I believe my future play is more important that the fact that I moved up in the ranking.""
Her future play could lead to even grander feats.
Park, who won the U. S. Women's Open, leads the LPGA Tour money list at just over $2.1 million with two tournaments remaining. She is second behind So Yeon Ryu for the points-based Player of the Year and already has clinched Rookie of the Year. Not since Nancy Lopez has a player won both awards in the same season.
Park also is No. 3 in the Race to the CME Globe and is second in the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average.
KOEPKA'S LIST: Brooks Koepka knew he had a big year from looking at that U. S. Open trophy. A look into his closet brought even more evidence.
One of Koepka's traditions at the start of every year is to go down to the beach and write a list of goals for the year on a yellow sheet of paper. He tapes it on the wall of his closet, then invariably forgets about it.
""I'm usually looking down trying to find clothes and shoes,"" he said.
A few weeks ago, he happened to look at eye level and noticed his list for the year, which had about seven items related to golf and five items off the golf course. Among the ones he ticked off was winning a major (U. S. Open), having at least a share of the first-round lead in a major (British Open) and then one of the bigger ones, having the lowest aggregate score in the majors (21-under par).
He described them as ""little goals,"" only because of the detail, such as having the solo lead after the first round. He took care of that Thursday in the HSBC Champions.
""You can make them as detailed as you want,"" he said. ""When you go into specifics, a lot of those things come true.""
He didn't get them all.
One goal was to not miss a cut. He missed the cut by one shot in his first tournament of the year at Torrey Pines. He also wanted to win multiple times, meaning he will have to either successfully defend at the Dunlop Phoenix next week in Japan or win the Hero World Challenge.
""The biggest change for me was off the golf course,"" Koepka said. ""The hardest thing for me was making sure I was in the gym five days a week when we played. Some days I've gone seven.""
Overall, Koepka was pleased with how many he got. He'll do it again this year, only at a different beach. Koepka will be on Maui for the Sentry Tournament of Champions.
WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?: The LPGA Tour tied a record when Stacy Lewis tied for 15th in the Toto Japan Classic. Lewis became the 15th player this year to top $1 million, equaling the number from last year.
And it's about to grow.
Women's PGA champion Danielle Kang is $647 short of $1 million and is assured of topping the $1 million mark next week at the CME Group Tour Championship. Minjee Lee is the defending champion this week in China. Lee is $3,268 short of $1 million, and provided she doesn't withdraw from Blue Bay, she will top $1 million.
Amy Yang and Mirim Lee will have to play well next week in Naples, Florida, to have a chance. Lizette Salas and Michelle Wie are farther away, but still in range, of the $1 million mark. Both are playing in China and next week at the season finale.
DIVOTS: Four of the five winners of full PGA Tour events this fall were in the Tour Championship. ... Patrick Cantlay won in Las Vegas at 9-under 275, the highest winning score by seven shots since it became a single-course event in 2008. This was just the third time the winning score has been worse than 20-under par. ... Jason Day, who started the year at No. 1, is now at No. 12. ... The PGA of America has extended the contract of chief executive Pete Bevacqua through 2024. ... Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Maryland, which has hosted U. S. Open sectional qualifying 30 of the last 31 years, has been selected to host the U.S. Women's Amateur in 2020. ... The PGA Tour Champions has a new title for its Tucson event — the Cologuard Classic. Cologuard, produced by Exact Sciences, is a colon cancer screening test used at home.
STAT OF THE WEEK: In the last two years, Shanshan Feng has three victories, two runner-up finishes and two third-place finishes during the LPGA Tour's fall version of the Asian swing.
FINAL WORD: ""Can we just keep playing here? Can we move the CME Group Tour Championship here? Can we move the U. S. Open here?"" — Shanshan Feng on playing LPGA Tour events in Asia.

"The US has expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, saying Havana failed to protect US diplomats from mysterious acoustic attacks.
The Department of State move follows last week's US withdrawal of more than half of its own diplomats from the Cuban capital.
Nearly two dozen US personnel have suffered unexplained ill health in the city.
""The decision was made due to Cuba's failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention. This order will ensure equity in our respective diplomatic operations,"" US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement on Tuesday.
The Cuban diplomats have been given seven days to leave.
Mr Rodriguez said the move was ""unjustified"".
At least 21 people working at the US's embassy in Cuba have reported health problems, ranging from mild brain trauma and deafness to dizziness and nausea.
Earlier reports suggested sonic attacks were to blame, but nothing has been proven.
Cuba denies targeting embassy staff, and the US has not blamed the country's government for the suspected attacks.
The Cuban response to the Trump Administration's decision to expel two-thirds of its diplomatic staff from Washington was predictably outraged. The US had been ""irresponsible"" and ""hasty"" the island's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said, insisting that the State Department hadn't provided ""a shred of evidence"" as to the harm caused to US diplomats in the alleged attacks.
Cuban doctors had not had any access to either the victims or the US medical staff attending to them, Mr Rodriuguez added.
Cuba-US relations are at a low ebb once again, almost completely erasing all the goodwill built up over the Obama presidency in a matter of months.
Millions of Cuban families are caught in the middle with visas for Cuban visitors to the United States suspended. The only glimmer of hope is that relations haven't been broken altogether and that the Cubans reiterated their willingness to work with the Americans to find a solution.
""We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to co-operate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,"" Mr Tillerson added in his latest statement.
Last week US officials said: ""We don't know the means, the methods or how the attacks are being carried out.""

"A robot and artificial intelligence revolution ison the horizon, a new report has warned, and the rise of AI will lead to mass unemployment as machines take over jobs that people currently perform.
The 300-page Bank of America Merrill Lynch report says as artificial intelligence continues to rise, jobs across multiple industries will be wiped out. The report predicts that 47% of workers in the US will have their jobs replaced by robots.
Some have noted that these warnings were used in the past. The rise of computers in the 1970s and 80s would lead to mass unemployment, many warned, but this never came to pass.
Others think the so-called robot revolution could be different.
“The poster child for automation is agriculture,” says Calum Chace, author of Surviving AI and the novelPandora’s Brain. “In 1900, 40 [percent] of the US labor force worked in agriculture. By 1960, the figure was a few per cent. And yet people had jobs; the nature of the jobs had changed.”
“But then again, there were 21 million horses in the US in 1900. By 1960, there were just three million. The difference was that humans have cognitive skills – we could learn to do new things. But that might not always be the case as machines get smarter and smarter.”
Artificial intelligence is already being used to replace some tasks, even in typically white collar professions. The Associated Press used an automated system to write earnings reports from thousands of American companies, work that was once done by journalists.
Forms of artificial intelligence have also been implemented in technology, with advancements like self-driving cars and Apple’s personal assistant, Siri.
Toyota has also added artificial intelligence research and development to its business objectives, investing $1 billion for a five-year effort to develop AI at its Toyota Research Institute in Silicon Valley.
The rise of artificial intelligence is already a fear of many. Earlier this year, a group of protesters spoke out against the rise of AI outside the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas.
There are warnings that artificial intelligence could affect more than just employment. Stephen Hawking, the world renowned physicist, has warned that artificial intelligence could one day surpass human intelligence, and in doing so would threaten all of human civilization. Elon Musk, who has been a leader in developing electric cars and private space flight, has voiced the same concerns, Time noted.
But others say there are safe ways to implement artificial intelligence. Futurist Ray Kurzweil believes that a careful approach could be a benefit to society.
“There are strategies we can deploy to keep emerging technologies like AI safe. Consider biotechnology, which is perhaps a couple of decades ahead of AI. A meeting called the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA was organized in 1975 to assess its potential dangers and devise a strategy to keep the field safe.
“The resulting guidelines, which have been revised by the industry since then, have worked very well: there have been no significant problems, accidental or intentional, for the past 39 years. We are now seeing major advances in medical treatments reaching clinical practice and thus far none of the anticipated problems.”
There are important fiscal considerations as artificial intelligence creeps into more areas of life, the report warned. It noted that as lower wage workers are pushed out of the workforce and replaced by robots, it will push wealth even further to the top and require careful attention to this wealth distribution, or else risk the kind of uprisings that took place around the time of the industrial revolution.",1

"The Trump administration on Saturday defended the White House statement on Holocaust Remembrance Dayreleased the previous day followingcriticism over it not mentioning Jews or anti-Semitism.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks toldCNNthat “despite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered.”
Hicks reportedly provided a link to astorythat noted that while 6 million Jews were killed by Nazis, another 5 million non-Jewish people were killed under Adolf Hitler.
CNN said it asked whether the White House was suggesting Trump omitted a reference to Jews as Holocaust victims out of concern it would offend others targeted by Nazis.
Hicks responded, “it was our honor to issue a statement in remembrance of this important day.”
The White House statement mentioned “innocent people” targeted by Nazis but didn’t mention Jews or anti-Semitism, which CNN noted drew a contrast from past statements by former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.
The Anti-Defamation League’s Jonathan Greenblatt called the omission “puzzling and troubling,” noting that it was a departure from past GOP and Democratic presidents.

"Less than ten years ago, 26 million Americans were receiving assistance to buy groceries – enrolled in the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program.
Today, after eight years of the Obama economy and the ever-expanding welfare policies, that number has exploded to 44 million who need help every month to put food on the table.
For many families, that is in addition to free breakfast and free lunch programs at public schools.
And yet, critics of President Trump’s proposed budget that would shift to a “welfare to work” policy that could move as many as six million Americans from dependency to self-sufficiency.
White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney appeared before Congress to discuss the president’s first budget and defended the proposal that Democrats call “cruel.”
“Growth cures so many ills, he said. “If you’re on food stamps and able-bodied, we need you to go to work.”
Although critics claim the economy is already operating at “full employment capacity,”Mulvaney says figures indicate that businesses should be able to take on in excess of an additional six million employees in the Trump economy.
Many states, like Colorado, have had similar programs in place for several years that would provide a prototype for the federal government, which funds the state-run SNAP benefits.
Georgia implemented a work requirement for residents receiving SNAP benefits beginning January 1, 2016, in just 3 of its 159 counties, expanding the pilot program to 21 counties.
Those who received the benefits were required to work at least 20 hours a week or be enrolled in state-approved job training or volunteering at a non-profit or charity.
Those who were unable to work because of a disability and the elderly were, of course, exempt, but the results in a mere 16-months are startling.
More than half, a shocking 62 percent of SNAP recipients in those counties, 7,251 dropped out of the food stamp program.
In what may be a smart move, the Trump budget proposal would take a page from successful state programs and apply it on a national basis to help many of the 44 million food stamp recipients find productive work that could move them to independence – while saving the government money.
What seems like a win-win will be characterized by opposition in Congress as proof that Republicans do not care about the poor and the minorities who make up the vast majority of those who rely on assistance for the barest of necessities.
Congress will again take up consider the budget when members return after the long Memorial Day weekend.",1
"Since we all know all too well how “Socialists” and “Communists” operate, this should be of no surprise to anyone. It appears Jane Sanders, the wife of Socialist Senator and past Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has gotten herself into some hot water.
Just like any good Socialist Jane Sanders, who was president of a very small Burlington College between 2004 to 2011, Decided to schemeher students in order to drive up admissionsfrom 200 to 400 full-time students. In order to do this, the college would require take on $10 million in debt to finance the purchase additional land for anew campus.
The plan included the purchase of a 33-acre plot on the shores of Lake Champlain which is owned by the Catholic Diocese of Burlington. The land even included an old building that used to be an orphanage, which was supposed to be the new college building.
People’s Bank agreed to purchase the bonds but only if the college was able to get at least $2.27 million in grants and donations prior to closing from donors. Sanders at the time of pre-approval of the loan stated she already had 2.6 million in donor funds lined up and that this number was just the beginning. So being the good Socialist that she is, in 2010, she went on to apply for 6.7 million in tax-exemptbonds. All of which were clearly a lie on Sander’s behalf, with intent to commitfraud. But I’m sure she won’t do any prison time because left-wing elitists like her who don’t know what an eyeliner is for always go free. Just ask Hillary.
“In a Dec. 22 email, Paul Van de Graaf, chief criminal lawyer for the U. S. attorney’s office, wrote to Bachman: “I think we need to make sure there is nothing significant to our federal investigation before (the records) are destroyed.”
Van de Graaf told Bachman the U. S. attorney would pay for the state to extend its lease on the property where the records were being stored. Bachman then drafted two resolutions for the Burlington College board to approve.
One resolution gave the U. S. attorney permission to “review and take possession” of the records being stored by the Agency of Education. The second authorized the Agency of Education to destroy any records that remain in its possession. Both are signed by Burlington College board Chair Yves Bradley and dated Dec. 28.
Van de Graaf and another lawyer with the U. S. attorney’s office began sifting through the Burlington College records Jan. 4, according to the emails.
On Feb. 2, Bachman told Van de Graaf that FBI special agent Patrick Hanna had requested an additional month to review the Burlington College records. She asked Van de Graaf to make sure he had the records he needed before March 1, so the state could begin shredding whatever remained.
The FBI spokesman VTDigger spoke with declined to say what Hanna does for the bureau.
Bachman said this week that the Agency of Education has now destroyed the remaining nonacademic records from Burlington College.
Bradley, the board chair, said Thursday that he was aware of an FBI investigation into Burlington College for more than a year. He said he and other board members were informed of the inquiry by Coralee Holm, who was at that time dean of operations and advancement.
Holm and others connected to the college were subpoenaed by the FBI, according to Bradley. Agents told Holm she could inform the board of trustees that an investigation was taking place, but she was directed not to provide any further information, Bradley said.
Holm, who is now public information officer for South Burlington, did not return a call seeking comment Thursday.
Bradley said he had no contact with the FBI or U. S. attorney — except through the college’s lawyer — and was not aware of who else was subpoenaed.”
I’m sure all “fairness” loving liberals will get out of this fraud is a warm tingly feeling knowingMr. and Mrs. Sanders are meant to be with each other. They are both con artists who have no shame. She defrauded a bank. The other, who is a charlatan who didn’t have a real job until he was elected to public office at the age of 40, defrauded an army of millennialvoters into believing he “cared” during the 2016primary season.

"A new report details how, since Trump was inaugurated, the number of illegal aliens crossing into US territory is DOWN 40%. That’s according to Border Patrol. Trump didn’t even have to do anything to stop illegals from streaming into our country!
Maybe that’s because they know the era of Obama giving them everything they could ever want is OVER. In addition, Trump is threatening to withdraw federal funding from “sanctuary cities”, which removes the last hold out they have in our country.
Even better, however, is that illegals currently in our country are FREAKING out about the idea of getting deported. The number of immigrants applying for the SNAP food stamp program is down, and the number of immigrants withdrawing from it is up!!
According to US Herald:
Luisa Fortin is the SNAP Outreach Coordinator for the Chattanooga Food Bank, and since mid-January, 5-families who are eligible for the program have withdrawn from the program. However, she currently has over 200 families signed-up for the program within the last 6-months. However, some of her clients are concerned that they may be deported if they stay within the SNAP Program.
“I get calls from concerned parents all the time: ‘should I take my kids out of the program?’” Fortin said. “They’re risking hunger out of fear … and my heart just breaks for them.”
However the law is very clear in that illegal aliens are not eligible for food stamps, however many live within an environment of “mixed eligibility” households, which receive benefits, case in point; illegal alien parents apply for food stamps on behalf of their citizen born children.
According to the Department of Agriculture, in 2015 over 1.5 million non-citizens received food stamps, combined with almost 4-million citizen children, living with non-citizen adults.
Legal immigrants, however, worry that receiving SNAP benefits may reflect negatively during the citizenship phase of their processing efforts, while illegal aliens worry about interacting with government officials,
An executive director at a Maryland community center who works with illegal aliens said: “Because of what’s happening with immigration, they want to remain anonymous. They just make do on menial amounts of food. They’re okay with rice and beans. I have parents who won’t even apply for free or reduced-price lunch because it puts them on the radar.”

"YouTube are aggressively censoring a video that shows the US military airdropping weapons to ISIS militants in Syria.
According to the YouTube team, the video keeps getting repeatedly deleted due to the fact that it violates their Community Guidelines.
Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: Alternative geopolitical analyst Mimi Al Laham, who goes by the name “Partisan Girl,” revealed on Twitter that one of her YouTube videos was flagged and removed upon review. “It documented US military airdrops falling into ISIS hands,” She wrote. “Truth is graphic content.”
The notice from YouTube claimed the video was removed because it violated the platform’s Community Guidelines. In addition to the video’s removal, Partisan Girl also received a “strike” or penalty on her account—a YouTube user can receive up to three “strikes.”
The title of the video was “US airdrops weapons into #ISIS hands – #Syria Ayn Al Arab,” and the reason YouTube gave for removing it was that it contained “violent or graphic content,” that was posted in “a shocking, sensational, or disrespectful manner.”
“If a video contains violent or graphic content that appears to be posting in a shocking, sensational, or disrespectful manner, it’s less likely to be allowed on YouTube. We also don’t allow content that’s intended to incite violence or encourage dangerous activities. We review content on a case by case basis and will only make limited exceptions for appropriate educational, documentary, artistic, and scientific contexts, where the purpose of posting is clear.”
The thing is, while a video of the U. S. military dropping weapons right into the hands of ISIS may be shocking to some, it is hardly sensational. In October 2014, the Pentagon admitted that the U.S. airdropped weapons to ISIS that were reportedly intended for Kurdish fighters in Kobani, Syria, and insisted that “the wind” was to blame.
However, this is not the first time the United States—whether intentionally of negligently—has been caught helping the group it claims to be at war with. The most recent case came to light in June when a 2016 audit from the Department of Defense revealed that it could not account for $1 Billion in weapons and equipment.
Patrick Wilcken, Amnesty International’s arms control and human rights researcher,noted that the latest audit is part of a troubling pattern that has been ongoing for years.
“This audit provides a worrying insight into the US Army’s flawed—and potentially dangerous—system for controlling millions of dollars’ worth of arms transfers to a hugely volatile region,”Wilcken said.“It makes for especially sobering reading given the long history of leakage of US arms to multiple armed groups committing atrocities in Iraq, including the armed group calling itself the Islamic State.”
In fact, the U. S. has given ISIS such a surplus of weapons and equipment, that some of those weapons are now being sold on Facebook by Islamic State militants. A report from 2016 revealed that “Jihadis in Syria areusing Facebook as a marketplace to buy, sell and barter a wide variety of American-made weapons and munitions ranging from rocket launchers to machine guns.”
In addition to support from Facebook, ISIS has also received ample support from YouTube. The platform has helped the militants by hosting their recruiting videos, while also helping the group by removing videos that reveal who is funding it, such as the one from Partisan Girl.
However, the subject of ISIS is not the only area where YouTube has questionable judgment. As The Free Thought Project has reported, YouTube also hosts thousands of videos with millions of views that are disguised as child-friendly content, while they actually promote violence, sex and pedophilia.",1
"The US Department of Commerce has said it has concluded that imports of Canadian softwood lumber are being unfairly subsidised.
In a statement released on Thursday, it said efforts to reach a negotiated agreement with Canada have failed.
Canada called the decision on countervailing and anti-dumping duties on lumber ""unfair, unwarranted and deeply troubling"".
This is the latest salvo in a lengthy dispute between the two countries.
The US has set final total tariffs for most Canadian softwood lumber producers at 20.8%. A handful of producers were singled out for individual duties, including one of up to 23.8%.
Except in one instance, those combined countervailing and anti-dumping duties are below preliminary tariffs issued earlier this year.
The final tariffs will be set if the US International Trade Commission (ITC) makes a determination that the US industry was harmed.
An ITC decision is due by 18 December.
In a joint statement on Thursday, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland and Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said they ""will forcefully defend"" the domestic softwood lumber industry.
""We are reviewing our options, including legal action through the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and the World Trade Organization, and we will not delay in taking action,"" they said.
Softwood lumber products, like pine, fir and spruce, are mainly used in the construction of single family houses.
The US has claimed for decades that Canada is unfairly subsidising its lumber industry by charging minimal fees to log public lands.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that the US remains committed to ""free, fair and reciprocal trade with Canada"", and that the decision is based on ""a full and unbiased review of the facts in an open and transparent process"".
The department said it had determined that Canadian exporters have sold softwood lumber to the US at 3.2-8.89% less than fair value.
It also maintains that the country is providing unfair subsidies at rates from 3.34-18.19%.
The US Commerce Department valued softwood lumber imports from Canada at C$7.6bn (US$5.6bn;4.3bn) in 2016.
In June, Canada announced C$867m (US$640m;500m) in relief for the country's lumber industry.
The aid came after the US first slapped hefty tariffs on the import of Canadian softwood lumber in April.
The department announcement comes during a tense point in trilateral talks between Canada, the US and Mexico to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.",0
"Samsung is the latest electronics giant to get into the online TV business.
Samsung Venture Investment Corp., a unit of the South Korean company, is making a $5 million investment in Los-Angeles based Pluto TV, the companies confirmed in a statement to NBC News. Other unnamed investors added $3.3 million more to the funding round.
Pluto TV is one of the biggest ad-supported online TV channel distributors, with about 6 million subscribers. It distributes more than 100 live TV channels from news and sports to cooking and kids' cartoons channels.
The investment is intended to help Samsung package a TV service with its other products, which include phones and TV sets.
Phone companies are increasingly tightening their connections with content companies. Sprint, for instance, took a 33 percent stake in the streaming music service Tidal earlier this year. AT&T is close to finalizing its acquisition of HBO owner Time Warner, while T-Mobile announced last month that it would package Netflix free for subscribers of its unlimited family plan.
""Pluto TV is the leading free Internet TV service in America and we see huge potential for the company as they scale their cutting edge offering to viewers around the world,"" Jihong Kim, senior investment manager with Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, said in a statement.

Pluto TV is led by Chief Executive Tom Ryan and Executive Chairman Ken Parks, the former chief content officer at the music service Spotify.
The company is backed by several investors, including Scripps Networks Interactive, which is being acquired by Discovery Communications; Sky; Germany's ProSieben Sat; and a host of others.
Impact Wrestling is the latest company to announce it is distributing its content via the service. Other content partners include The Onion, Bloomberg and NBCUniversal, which owns NBC News.",0

"The ash tree is likely to be wiped out in Europe, according to a review of the evidence.
The trees are being killed off by the fungal disease ash-dieback along with an invasive beetle called the emerald ash borer.
According to the research, published in the Journal of Ecology, the British countryside will never look the same again.
The paper says that the ash will most likely be ""eliminated"" in Europe.
This could mirror the way Dutch elm disease largely wiped out the elm in the 1980s.
Ash trees are a key part of the treescape of Britain. You don't have to go to the countryside to see them. In and around towns and cities there are 2.2 million. In woodland, only the oak is more common.
However, according to a review led by Dr Peter Thomas of Keele University and published in the Journal of Ecology, ""between the fungal disease ash dieback and a bright green beetle called the emerald ash borer, it is likely that almost all ash trees in Europe will be wiped out - just as the elm was largely eliminated by Dutch elm disease"".
Ash dieback, also known as Chalara, is a disease that was first seen in Eastern Europe in 1992. It now affects more than 2 million sq km, from Scandinavia to Italy.
It was identified in England in 2012 in a consignment of imported infected trees. It has since spread from Norfolk and Suffolk to South Wales. Caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, it kills the leaves, then the branches, trunk and eventually the whole tree. It has the potential to destroy 95% of ash trees in the UK.
The emerald ash borer is a bright green beetle that, like ash dieback, is native to Asia. It's not yet in the UK but is spreading west from Moscow at a rate of 25 miles (41 km) a year and is thought to have reached Sweden.
The adult beetles feed on ash trees and cause little damage. However the larvae bore under the bark and in to the wood, killing the tree.
According to Dr Thomas: ""Our European ash is very susceptible to the beetle. It is only a matter of time before it spreads across the rest of Europe - including Britain - and the beetle is set to become the biggest threat faced by ash in Europe, potentially far more serious than ash dieback.""
This won't just change our landscape - it will have a severe impact on biodiversity. 1,000 species are associated with ash or ash woodland, including 12 types of bird, 55 mammals and 239 invertebrates.
Mr Thomas said, ""Of these, over 100 species of lichens, fungi and insects are dependent upon the ash tree and are likely to decline or become extinct if the ash was gone.
""Some other trees such as alder, small-leaved lime and rowan can provide homes for some of these species... but if the ash went, the British countryside would never look the same again.""
One small hope is that some cloned ash trees have shown resistance against the fungus. But that won't protect them against the beetle.",0
"The Iraqi army have discovered a number of US-made missiles in an ISIS military base in the Southern part of Mosul, Iraq.
According to local sources, missiles originating from the USA have found their way into the Anbar province before.
Provincial officials confirmed that the US-made weapons were sent by the US-led anti-ISIL coalition airplane for the ISIL terrorists in Anbar province.
Meantime, Iraqi security officials announced that the ISIL has sent US-made military equipment to Tal Afar region in the last two days to stand strong against Iraqi popular forces’ impending attack to capture the region.
“The ISIL terrorists have sent US-made TOW anti-tank missiles to Tal Afar and it is quite evident that they are preparing for a long-term war,” the Arabic-language media quoted an Iraqi security official as saying on Monday.
In late August 2015, a senior Iraqi intelligence official revealed that the US helicopters drop weapons and other aids for the ISIL terrorists in the Western province of al-Anbar.
“The fighters present at the forefront of fighting against the ISIL always see US helicopters flying over the ISIL-controlled areas and dropping weapons and urgent aids for them,” the official who called for anonymity told FNA.
Yet, he said the helicopters could have also been sent from Turkey or Israel.
He added that in addition to dropping aids, the helicopters transfer the ISIL ringleaders and wounded members from the battleground to some hospitals in Syria or other countries which support the terrorist group.
The official cautioned that such assistance further prolongs the conflicts in Anbar, adding that when the Iraqi army and popular forces purge the terrorists from Anbar province, the US helicopters will transfer the ISIL ringleaders to other regions to prevent the Iraqi forces’ access to ISIL secrets.
Also in March 2015, a group of Iraqi popular forces known as Al-Hashad Al-Shabi shot down the US Army helicopter that was carrying weapons for the ISIL in the Western parts of Al-Baghdadi region in Al-Anbarprovince.
Meantime in February 2015, a senior lawmaker disclosed that Iraq’s army had shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province.
“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” al-Zameli said.",1

In the dusty heart of West Texas, rows of tall white wind turbines and rust-colored working pump jacks bob up and down along the vast rugged landscape.
It’s a visual juggernaut but make no mistake – this is shale country and in this part of the Lone Star State, legends are born and billions are made every single day.
Take Texas natives Cody Campbell and John Sellers, for example. They met in the seventh grade, played football together at Canyon High School and ended up at Texas Tech University.
Campbell went on to the NFL, playing as an offensive guard with the Indianapolis Colts while Sellers made money in real estate.
In 2009, the two friends started Double Eagle Energy Holding, where they signed lucrative land deals on the hoods of their pickups and lived lease-to-lease.
“It was a crazy, very humble starting point for us,” Sellers said. “We were the lowest form of oil guys.”

American oil legend Mark Papa helped start the U. S. shale boom in the 1990s. In the course of a decade, a $1 investment with him grew to $1,800. He tapped out when the market went bust but came out of retirement at the age of 70 when he saw opportunity in the Permian Basin. In two short years, Papa boosted the value of his new venture, Centennial Resource Development Inc., more than six-fold.
“We’ve got a history of wildcatters who came out and risked everything to try and build the industry,” Stacie Hanna, director of marketing and education at the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum, told Fox News. “We have people with that same kind of outlook and energy out here now.”
'We've got a history of wildcatters who came out and risked everything...'
Not only has Texas’ role as a petroleum powerhouse created colorful Horatio Alger-esque rags-to-riches stories but it’s also netted billions of dollars and created hundreds of jobs for the state.
Despite some skeptical analysts, the shale industry in the Permian Basin - a 300-mile stretch of open land from West Texas to southeast New Mexico - isn’t showing signs of slowing down.
The prospect of striking it rich is everywhere.
Like so many of the dreamer-turned-tycoon stories the area churns out, success at Permian wasn’t a given. It was born out of grit, determination and hard work. Making it big meant going all in on an area that was a relative latecomer to the shale revolution.
Instead, early success stories belonged to the Barnett Shale formation in the northeastern part of the state. The area was first fracked by pioneer George Mitchell in the early 1990s.
Mitchell put the spotlight on Barnett and the Marcellus Formation in Pennsylvania, and both were largely considered “hot spots” on the shale map. Production in the Permian, by contrast, was just in its infancy.
Permian’s big break came after a handful of oilmen figured out how to crack open shale and find oil. By 2013, Permian was on the top of everyone’s list. Since then, the basin has been at the epicenter of the U.S. shale revival and has become one of the country’s most vital energy producing regions.
Advances in directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing – a method of recovering oil and gas from underground shale deposits – have enabled oil companies to dig even deeper into the ground.
It’s also helped the country wean itself from coal and has “reduced emissions dramatically along the way,” Michael E. Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at The University of Texas at Austin, said.
In the past five years, output from the Permian has doubled to 2.5 million barrels a day, making it among the most prolific oil and gas producing regions in the nation. The next five years could be even more profitable.
“Texas is far from tapped out,” Scott Tinker, director of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin, told Fox News. “Oil and natural gas are limited not so much by supply, but rather by the dynamics of demand, price, technology, public acceptance, energy alternatives at scale, and politics.”
But it isn’t always that easy. Shale has its own set of market-based problems and the industry has gone through its fair share of rough patches.
“We’re used to the ups and downs,” Hanna said. “They're tough, man. They’re really tough. They always have been.”
Still, while other shale patches have petered out, Permian keeps on going. It’s naturally gifted with thick bands of the mudstones that are up to 15 times the diameter of similar patches across the country.
According to an October drilling productivity report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. oil output is expected to increase by 82,000 barrels per day to 6.12 million bpd.
Production at both of Texas’ massive shale oil plays – the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford – are expected to jump. The report predicts oil from Eagle Ford will increase by 2,500 bpd to 1.2 million and forecasts production in the Permian rising by 50,000 bpd to 2.7 million bpd – a new record.
“Here we go again,” Dallas native Lisa Westin, whose family has been in the oil business for decades, told Fox News. “We’re ready for it. Whatever happens, Texas and its people are tough and we know how to handle the ups and downs.”
