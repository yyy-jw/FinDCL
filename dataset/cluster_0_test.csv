"After every Muslim terrorist attack, the mainstream media’s first instinct is to talk about discrimination against Muslims, rather than keeping Americans safe. MSNBC even brought on former Islamic extremist Mubin Shaikh to shame Americans don’t like Islam. He claimed these Americans are what are causing Muslims to join ISIS.
“Look, self-radicalization, I mean what we’re trying to say is that these are people who radicalize not in traditional groups like before. They go online, they get most of their ideology, but, this is something that they’ve already decided to engage in,” said Shaikh.
“A person doesn’t go online and read something and decide, ‘Oh, I‘m going to be–oh, I believe this. I‘m going to go and act on this.’ They already have this going on inside them before they turn to the internet or somebody like in a real human network,” he said.
“What we need to look into is why this person even feels they need to look that way. And one of the things is hatred–is hatred, and alienation, and marginalization. Think about it this way–when you tell a kid that he’s dumb, he’s stupid, he’s going to amount to nothing, what do you think is going to happen with that kid? He’s going to take that, internalize that, and externalize it by acting it out onto other people,” he said.
“So, it does require a number of steps to be taken complimentary but simultaneously. Not just the domestic law enforcement piece, not just the intelligence piece, especially from these communities. If you keep flipping off the Muslim community, and then demanding they give you the intelligence, the reality just doesn’t work like that,” said Shaikh. Check out the video below.",1

"Organization:
Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were ""resolved"" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the Wayback Machine, providing a path back to lost websites and work.
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
The Archive Team Panic Downloads are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.
Archive Team now searches many, many news sites, including extensive worldwide and obscure sources, to capture unique news stories for history.

In Tom Stoppard’s play Night and Day, an idealistic reporter praises the lurid British tabloids as evidence that all is right on Fleet Street. “Junk journalism,” he says, “is the evidence of a society that has got at least one thing right: that there should be nobody with the power to dictate where responsible journalism begins.”
I feel the same way about fake news. Whenever and wherever it appears, we are reassured that no government, no corporations and no media establishment dictate where the rights to self-expression begin and where they end.
Which is not to say I begrudge the efforts of those trying to stamp out the hoaxsters, flim-flam artists and Russian agents polluting our social-media feeds. As gouts of fake news and propaganda course through the media’s circulatory system, all right-thinking people have risen to denounce it. A new Pew study mopes about the damage done by false and misleading information to our political structure, and its experts split evenly on whether the environment will improve or get worse. A report from PEN America urges us to confront the menace of fake news with news literacy education and other remedies before our democracy turns white hot and vaporizes. Meanwhile, Facebook has promised to do a better job policing propaganda and disinformation, as have Google and Twitter. Across media platforms, fact-checkers and truth-squaders have joined the battle against all the fakery, winning skirmishes but seeming to lose the war.
Let’s wish Pew, PEN America, and the others well in this crusade. Intentionally fake news fouls the public sphere and warps the political process. A just god would smite the fake news artists and then breathe new life into them to smite them again. But there is no god, so what else can we do? Like Stoppard’s British hack, I can find an upside in the profusion of fake news. Every time you stumble onto fake news you uncover evidence of how free our press is and how far the freedom of speech extends.
The ease with which the Russians slid their fake news and advertisements about Black Lives Matter, Islam, Texas secessionism, gun control, immigration and other combustible topics under the door to ignite latent passions speaks well of our open society. I hate disinformation, but I tend not to fear it, putting my faith in the power of honest discourse to undo the mischief-makers in the long run. Bring on both truth and bullshit, I say—and trust individuals to do the sorting. I abhor paternalism, whether it comes from a coercive government or an internet power like Google and Facebook that think it should shield me from all incorrect thinking. Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos spoke for me this month when he tweeted, “A lot of people aren’t thinking hard about the world they are asking [Silicon Valley] to build.” Any tools or conventions used to ban fake news could be repurposed to block inconvenient news.
Another benefit to the addition of fake news into our media diet: It makes us more critical of what we read and view, more demanding of proof and provenance, less obedient to authority and more self-reliant in our thinking. Had we been more skeptical of the official story, perhaps we could have avoided the Iraq invasion.
The current hysteria overlooks the fact that there’s a long tradition of fake news in our press. Supermarket tabloids have long peddled half-true sensational stories without putting our government at risk. Earlier this year, I wrote a whole feature about the National Enquirer’s pro-Trump misinformation campaign. To my delight, the tabloid has all but abandoned its bogus Trump news direct in recent months. Evidently, readers weren’t buying it.
We forget, too, that in the early days of the republic, political “misinformation” filled the scandal-rag press. These outrageous tales were advanced not by wily Russians but by party members seeking to undermine the other party. They sent all sorts of scurrilous rumors under the door and into print, and yet high-minded political debate thrived in a parallel publishing space. Obviously, this parable isn’t perfect: It was Americans peppering other Americans with fake news, not hot Russia-on-America action. But you catch my drift.
For all the scaremongering, it turns out that Russian fake news didn’t make much of a splash. As pollster-strategist Mark Penn wrote on the Wall Street Journal op-ed page last week, Russian spending on political advertising in 2016 was infinitesimal compared with the $2.4 billion spent by the presidential campaigns. The Russians spent about $100,000 on Facebook ads, he writes, but 56 percent of them ran after the election. His napkin math concludes that the actual election-year electioneering by the Russians amounted to about $6,500, which is hardly the end of the world.
When the alarmists stamp their feet and say, yeah, but the Web makes the disinformation more dangerous because it allows it to move faster, stamp your own feet and say, yeah, but the debunking moves just as fast. If the FDA can allow an average of 75 insect fragments per 50 grams of flour, surely we can survive a little fake news without flipping our lids.

"Google hopes a little browser tool will help change the world.
The company that revolutionized Internet search is now unveiling a sort of online underground tunnel — a way for people in restrictive countries like Iran and Syria to get around digital censorship and surveillance.
The idea behind the tool — essentially a button for browsers — called uProxy, is simple: People in countries such as the United States provide their trusted friends a secure connection so that they can see and use the unrestricted Internet.
Google showed it off earlier this week at a conference called “Conflict in a Connected World.” Google also rolled out technology to map cyberattacks around the world, including by repressive governments.
The innovations, from a division of the company called Google Ideas, come at a time when the Internet, and social media in particular, is playing an increasing role in popular upheaval around the world, most notably in the Middle East.
“These are going to be useful additions to the activist toolkit,” said Philip Howard, a professor at the University of Washington who has written about the impact of social media on political change.
“Authoritarian governments have started figuring out how to use social media to spy on activists and control political conversation,” he said. “Any new tool that lets people network with family and friends in a secure way is likely to have a political impact.”
In the two-year civil war in Syria, efforts by opponents of President Bashar Assad to inform the world were met by “unrelenting online repression,” according to the free-information group Reporters Without Borders.
Iran has intensified surveillance and jammed Internet lines during periods of unrest. China has censored touchy keywords, including “democracy” and “human rights.” Similar but smaller repression took place during uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia.
And just in June, Turkey tightened its grip on Twitter, which it accused of helping people spread lies about the government and terrorize society. It also sought to target “provocateurs” on social media, without giving details.
The uProxy tool essentially provides a mask for dissidents. They can establish a secure connection with someone across the world, in a free-Internet country, whom they trust, and read and post online without surveillance or blocking.
Chinese citizens already use similar connections to get around what is known as the Great Firewall — the government’s blocking of much of the Western Internet, including social media sites.
Google calls its way“a safer path to the Internet.” David Drummond, a senior vice president at the company, told the conference Monday that Google “was founded on the belief that access to information is a social good.”
“More information in more hands means more education, more economic opportunity, more accountability,” he said. “Access, in short, is good. And it’s why the Internet’s so freeing.”
In an initiative called Project Shield, Google is also offering to host websites that come under politically motivated shutdown attacks. That initiative is still in testing but has already been endorsed by a popular Persian-language news website.
Google, a company with a market value north of one-third of a trillion dollars, says it’s about free expression, not a business interest — in fact the projects are targeted toward many countries under economic sanctions.
It’s an interesting move because Google, at least its Ideas division, “sees censorship as Internet damage and wants to route around it,” said Danny O’Brien, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group.
The drawback is that it may lead countries to target Google more explicitly, he said.
The tool deliberately avoids Google servers, he said — individual computers act as the middlemen, getting packets of information from repressive countries like Iran and China out to the world.
“But if you put a big Google label on a service like this, you might expect to get blowback,” said O'Brien.
Howard, from the University of Washington, cautioned that getting around Internet censorship is not as simple as building a virtual tunnel. Whether Google’s ideas have an equal impact in all repressive regimes remains to be seen, he said.
The Chinese government, for example, has negotiated special treatment from search companies before, and has plenty of money and power to build its own Internet tools. And Russia has poured money into keeping the Internet from being free there.
During the Arab Spring, he said, “We saw how a handful of democracy advocates could use digital media to catch dictators off-guard.” But it wasn’t long before governments figured out how to use social media for surveillance and censorship.
Sheldon Himelfarb, director of the PeaceTech initative at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonprofit created by Congress to prevent conflict abroad, surveyed the reaction from activists online and said it was positive — “a lot of excitement tempered by mistrust.”
He cited the uproar over National Security Agency surveillance programs and doubts about whether the Google initiatives could further open the door for the United States to gather information.
While it’s important to remember the risks that come with the new technology, he said, he believes it looks like “good news for Internet freedom.”

"A teenage ISIS suicide bomber entered the Shah Noorani Sufi Muslim shrine in a remote part of southwestern Pakistan and detonated a bomb among packed worshippers, killing at least 45 people and injuring dozens more.
A huge explosion hit the Shah Noorani Shrine located in the Khuzdar District of the southwestern Pakistani province of Balochistan.
The incident occurred during a religious dance in the shrine – a ceremony attended by dozens of people on a daily basis.
According to eyewitnesses cited by local media, at least 500 people were in the shrine at the moment of the blast.
The total number of casualties is still unknown, although various media give conflicting reports concerning the initial death toll. According to the Pakistani Samaa TV channel, the blast claimed the lives of 15 people and injured many more, while a journalist from ARY news reports that at least ten people were killed in the incident and another 30 were injured.
Dargah Shah Noorani Bomb Blast: Rescue sources confirm death toll rises to 30, more than 95 people are injured, rise in death toll is feared pic.twitter.com/NHRBf4LkIA
Sources in the rescue services confirmed to Pakistani Dunya news that the death toll has reached 30, adding that the number of injured so far amounts to 95.
Provincial Interior Minister Sarfaraz Bugti confirmed that the death toll has reached 45 while a local district commissioner Hashim Ghalzai said that more than 100 people were wounded in the incident, Reuters reported.
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, as reported by Reuters.
Dunya states the explosion was a bomb attack. The attack was allegedly carried out by a 14-year-old boy, the Express Tribune reports, citing police sources.
Women and children were among those killed and injured in the blast. A rescue team and security services are having difficulty reaching the scene, as the shrine is located in a remote mountainous area hundreds of kilometers away from the southern Pakistani port-city of Karachi.
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to the victims and their families, as reported by the Express Tribune.
The bomb attack on the shrine comes less than a month after another terrorist attack that hit the Pakistani province of Balochistan. On October 24, a gunman stormed a police training facility in Balochistan’s largest city of Quetta, taking hundreds of cadets hostage. About 60 people died in that incident and over 100 were injured.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack. In August, a suicide bomber targeted the emergency services ward at Quetta’s Civil Hospital. That attack claimed the lives of 70 people.",1
"Millions of Hindis everywhere have begun a pilgrimage to Norway after a Norwegian couple recently gave birth to a half-human/half-elephant hybrid that many Hindu practitioners believe to be the reincarnation of the popular deity Ganesha. He is commonly depicted as a man with several limbs and the head of an elephant, something that if it were to actually exist, the very sight of it would haunt us to the grave.
Alexandar and Lola Andersen first attempted to keep their child a secret from the world but soon pictures of the child along with the identity of the family leaked to the media. The Andersen’s found themselves celebrities in the country of India.
“We wish they would stop hanging outside of our home. Why won’t they just leave us alone? We’ve already been through enough. My baby looks like an elephant and even worse, he’s a ginger. If they hand me one more basket, I’m going to stab them in their fase,” said Lola Andersen, the baby’s name.
When asked of the child’s name, father Alexandar only answered, “we never really gave it a name. To be quite honest, we were just going to call it the creature that we keep in the basement. We were essentially just going to keep the little gingerphant in the basement and feed him drifters that we picked up off of the road. This does open up some new options. We might sell him to India. They’d probably let him live in the Taj Mahal.”

"Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, said Monday that the administration will continue using the term “fake news” until the media understands that their “monumental desire” to attack the President is wrong.
“There is a monumental desire on behalf of the majority of the media, not just the pollsters, the majority of the media to attack a duly elected President in the second week of his term,” Gorka, a former Breitbart editor who also holds a PhD in political science, told syndicated conservative radio host Michael Medved.
“That’s how unhealthy the situation is and until the media understands how wrong that attitude is, and how it hurts their credibility, we are going to continue to say, ‘fake news.’ I’m sorry, Michael. That’s the reality,” he added.
Trump and his staff have repeatedly used the term “fake news” to discredit reporting on the presidential administration from mainstream outlets such as CNN and The New York Times, often offering no evidence to back up their disputes with those outlets’ stories.
Earlier in the interview, Gorka was asked Medved whether he would acknowledge that the administration’s controversial statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day was “at least questionable in being the first such statement in many years that didn’t recognize that Jewish extermination was the chief goal of the Holocaust.”
Gorka replied by calling criticism of the statement “asinine,” arguing that it was motivated by the media’s desire to attack Trump.
“It’s a Holocaust remembrance statement,” Gorka said. “No, I’m not going to admit it. Because it’s asinine. It’s absurd. You’re making a statement about the Holocaust. Of course it’s about the Holocaust because that’s what the statement’s about. It’s only reasonable to twist it if your objective is to attack the President.”
Gorka also sparred with a caller who contended that “every time you call everything fake news, it just turns everyone except your hardcore fans off.”
“You know, I would beg to differ,” Gorka shot back. “Every single organ that generates these kinds of stories comes from the same clique of media organs that predicted that Hillary (Clinton) would win and that Brexit wouldn’t occur. I know what fake news is. And it’s coming from those organizations. It’s time that you yourself understood that as well.”",1
"A Criminal Complaint was filed in the Southern District of Georgia, charging Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a Federal contractor from Augusta, beforeGeorgia, with removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet, in violation of 18 U. S.C. Section 793(e).
He was arrested by the FBI at her home on Sunday, June 3, and appeared in federal court in Augusta.
“Exceptional law enforcement efforts allowed us quickly to identify and arrest the defendant,” said Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.
“Releasing classified material without authorization threatens our nation’s security and undermines public faith in government. People who are trusted with classified information and pledge to protect it must be held accountable when they violate that obligation.”
According to the allegations contained in the criminal complaint:
Winner is a contractor with Pluribus International Corporation assigned to a U. S. government agency facility in Georgia. She has been employed at the facility since on or about February 13 and has held a Top Secret clearance during that time. On or about May 9, Winner printed and improperly removed classified intelligence reporting, which contained classified national defense information from an intelligence community agency and unlawfully retained it. Approximately a few days later, Winner unlawfully transmitted by mail the intelligence reporting to an online news outlet.
Once investigative efforts identified Winner as a suspect, the FBI obtained and executed a search warrant at her residence. According to the complaint, Winner agreed to talk with agents during the execution of the warrant. During that conversation, Winner admitted intentionally identifying and printing the classified intelligence reporting at issue despite not having a “need to know,” and with the knowledge that the intelligence reporting was classified. Winner further admitted removing the classified intelligence reporting from her office space, retaining it, and mailing it from Augusta, Georgia, to the news outlet, which she knew was not authorized to receive or possess the documents.
An individual charged by criminal complaint is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.
The prosecution is being handled by Trial Attorney Julie A. Edelstein of the U. S. Department of Justice’s National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Solari of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Georgia. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI.",1
"And it already was too late almost 200 years ago. This is because America has always been in large part Latino. If Donald Trump was to build that M. C. Escher-esque wall between the U.S. and Mexico based on the maps of those countries in 1821, well, that wall would be all the way up on the border between California and Oregon. That's right! Back then, California was Mexico, so if you think you are hearing a lot of Spanish in that state now, well, you have no idea how much Spanish you're not hearing there.
Donald Trump's immigration plan could affect the nation's milk supply
And here's another bit of breaking news. When Arnold Schwarzenegger was pronouncing it ""Cal-LEE-fornia,"" he was right -- he just didn't realize he was accidentally speaking Spanish.
So despite the rhetoric of the right that demonizes, criminalizes and attempts to demoralize and sometimes outright arch-villianize Latinos, every Latino person I met during this episode was very hopeful about their future, no matter how dire their circumstances in the present seemed to me. And not even just hopeful, but extremely joyful about their lives and futures.
That is a trait I recognize from people in my own community. No matter how much we have to fight and struggle to better ourselves and our circumstances, we know ""we gon' be alright"" (to quote the prophet, Kendrick Lamar). I guess I was surprised by this common feeling, because I met people in Los Angeles whose lives seemed so much harder than anything I could have imagined experiencing in my own life.

Latinos divided over Trump's immigration stance 02:58
As I point out in the episode, many members of Latino communities are wary of speaking on camera, because they are or someone they are close to is undocumented. But I met a Latino family who, like many Latino families in this country, has mixed status. This means some family members are U.S. citizens and some are not. And this family not only very generously opened up their home to me for dinner, but they were also happy to tell their story on camera and use their real names.
So much for hiding in the shadows. Unlike her younger brothers, the oldest daughter, Maria, was not a U.S. citizen. But like most high school seniors, she was way more focused on getting into college (preferably one as far away from home as possible) than she was scared of ""La Migra"" (The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) coming to get her and her family.

And some version of two major themes about what it means to be Latino in America came out of every conversation.
The first: how important it is that they never forget their history and culture -- and that one way to do that is to remix their traditions with the current day so they will grow into the future. The second: no matter what people do or say to try to keep them out of this country, they ain't going nowhere. Because they are this country.

Again, I was shocked by their attitude. When you watch the news, you can get the impression that Latino Americans are somehow skulking, fearful at every turn of the nation's scorn and the country's capriciousness around that whole classic American idea of ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.""
But that's not the case. Latinos are here, they've been here, and they also know that backup is on the way. According to the U.S. Census, the Latino population is going to more than double what it is today by the year 2060. And that is certain to make Donald Trump, and the people who like Donald Trump, ""se van a volver locos!""

"Thechief executive of thethe world’s largest company, Apple, is calling on governments to launch a public information campaign to fight the scourge of fake news, which is “killing people’s minds”.
Tim Cooke says that the ‘epidemic’ of false reports “is a big problem around the world” which requires a crackdown by the authorities and technology firms.
He believes technology companies should create tools that would help diminish the volume of “fake news”
Made-up news reports trying to promote a particular agenda gained huge traction on social media in the US during the election.
“It has to be ingrained in the schools, it has to be ingrained in the public,”said Mr Cook. “There has to be a massive campaign. We have to think through every demographic.
“We need the modern version of a public-service announcement campaign. It can be done quickly if there is a will.”
The rise of fake news was being driven by unscrupulous firms determined to attract online readers at any cost, he said.
“We are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth,” he said.“It’s killing people’s minds in a way.”
Tech firms, which have been criticised for doing too little, also need to up their game, he said.
“All of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news.
“We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press, but we must also help the reader. Too many of us are just inthe complain category right now and haven’t figured out what to do.”",1

Wow now that shows right wing intellect I understand why you love Trump. This is a guy you know nothing about him except for what he tells you. Do a little reseach and find out who that cock sucker really is. Look at the trail of devastation he left behind him with all his bankruptcies. Most of them he created himself by filing chapter 11 screwed his sub contractors and sold the property. You have no idea who that prick is and what he is capable of. I have known that cock sucker for 35 years and he is without a doubt the worst kind of person on the face of this earth. But intellectually sound morons like you love him.

"Twitter (TWTR) said Thursday it is banning advertisements on its platform from two Russian media firms, Russia Today and Sputnik, citing an internal investigation and findings by intelligence authorities that the companies sought to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election.
The social media company also said it would donate $1.9 million, the amount Twitter estimated it has earned from RT since 2011, to help fund research into potential abuses of the microblogging service in elections and other civic activities.
""We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,"" the company said in a statement.
The ad restriction applies only to RT, an English-language TV broadcaster that receives financial support from the Russian government, and Sputnik, a news agency and online news outlet.
In a story published on its website, RT denied trying to interfere in the US election, saying that it ""has never been involved in any illegal activity online.""
""RT has never spread any sort of deliberate misinformation,"" the company said. ""If we had, RT would have been banned by any social media platform in question, as all of them have strict rules regarding policy violations.""
RT said Twitter approached the media company in 2016 to discuss a potential advertising deal to promote RT's U. S. election coverage on the blogging service. RT said it declined the proposal.
In anotherarticle on Thursday, RT cited a spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry who called Twitter's move a ""blatant violation"" of international norms and threatened retaliation.
""We consider this a yet another aggressive step aiming to block the activity of Russian channel RT,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement to the media company.
Twitter, Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) face scrutiny as part of an ongoing probe into Russian meddling in last year's U. S. presidential election. Representatives from the companies are scheduled to appear before a House intelligence panel next week to answer questions about their roles in such interference.
Twitter said on Tuesday that it will provide more information about political ads that run on the platform, including who is funding them and whom they are aimed at.
Facebook has also agreed to disclose ads to Congress that were purchased by Russians on the social media platform. The social media giant said in September that roughly 3,000 ads connected with 470 fake accounts ran on Facebook between June of 2015 and May of this year. Some of those accounts, which targeted U. S. voters before and after the 2016 election, were linked to a Russian group called the Internet Research Agency that has been identified as a ""troll farm.""",0
"The links between NPR and Member Stations are many and deep. At the core, we share a mission to inform the public, increase understanding of the world and enrich the experience of everyday life.
NPR Member Stations are independent, locally owned and operated broadcasters. In an era of media consolidation and corporate ownership, these local stations are becoming an increasingly rare and even more vital source of local news and information for the communities they serve.
About two-thirds of stations are licensed to, or are affiliated with, colleges or universities. The remaining third are governed by community-based boards. Some stations are operated jointly with public TV stations.
Each Member Station determines its own format and schedule. In creating their broadcast schedule, Member Stations have several options. They may choose to select from NPR programs such as Morning Edition, All Things Considered or Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!; pick up programs distributed by other public radio producers, stations or networks; and/or create their own local programming. Stations create their schedules based on the interests and needs of their local audience. Some stations focus on news and information while others follow a music format – with programming ranging from classical, to jazz, to AAA or world music.
Member Stations are partners with NPR in newsgathering. Member Station reporters provide hundreds of news pieces every year, putting NPR News on the scene wherever news happens.
Station reporting makes up a key part of NPR's national newsmagazines and newscasts, and is especially critical for the coverage of milestone news events such natural disasters, the impact of war on local communities, and national elections. These reports bring local flavor, relevance and perspective to NPR programs, with local reporters and hosts who are deeply familiar with the issues, events and people they cover.
Several programs that NPR distributes are produced by NPR Member Stations, not NPR. These include top-rated news and cultural programs such as Fresh Air with host Terry Gross from WHYY (Philadelphia); 1A with Joshua Johnson from WAMU (Washington, DC); On Point from WBUR (Boston); and World Café from WXPN (Philadelphia).
Public radio stations choose to apply for NPR membership. Once they meet the criteria (including mission, 24/7 broadcast operations, minimum number of staff), they pay annual membership dues and are entitled to the benefits of membership. This includes a set of rights to NPR programming, content, digital distribution streaming and inclusion in mobile products. Members may associate their brand with NPR's, and they have a voice in NPR's consultations with its Members and a vote in the election of the station manager members of the NPR Board of Directors.
In addition to paying membership dues, Member Stations pay fees for the individual NPR programs they choose to broadcast. These fees and dues make up the largest source of operating revenue for NPR.
What you hear every day on your local station grows out of a long-standing partnership between NPR and NPR Member Stations. It's programming and content that you make possible, by giving support to your local station.",0
"A leading international education expert has said that children should be taught in schools how to recognise “fake news”.
According to Andreas Schleicher, thethe OECD’s director of education and skills, schools need to teach their pupils how to think critically and analyse what they read on social media and news sites.
“This is something that we believe schools can do something about” he said.
He also suggested that social media creates an “echo-chamber” in which users only hear from viewpoints similar to their own, and argued that schools have a role to play in making sure that young people have a chance to debate different views and opinions.
Mr Schleicher’s comments come ahead of the annual Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai, where he will put forward the OECD’s plans to test young people’s attitudes to global issues and different cultures, their analytical and critical skills and abilities to interact with others.
These “global competencies” are becoming increasingly important, he said.
“In the past, when you needed information, you went to an encyclopaedia, you looked it up, and you could trust that information to be true,” Mr Schleicher said.
He added that today, anyone using social media or even news sites has to be able to assess, evaluate and reflect on the information they are given.
“Distinguishing what is true from what is not true is a critical skill today,” he said.
“Exposing fake news, even being aware that there is something like fake news, that there is something that is written that is not necessarily true, that you have to question, think critically. That is very important.
“This is something that we believe schools can do something about.”
Pupils can learn about the world, how to analyse what they see and hear around them and engage in debate in lessons.
“Schools can do a lot to equip students with the kind of cognitive ability to access and analyse meaning, culture, practice, things like this,” he said.
He added that it is not a matter of schools teaching a new subject, but building these skills into all lessons, from science to history.",1
"In the intelligence community, it is taught that the best way to hide something is to place it in open view. That’s where the New World Order infrastructure is right now.
Democracy as we know it in Britain and the U. S. is only a few hundred years old. The majority of Europe and the rest of the world has been ruled by powerful elites with absolute power. Domination is by means of force. The high cabal of the New World Order would like to see this model reinstituted.
The Royal Institute of International Affairs functions at the behest of the British monarchy. They have spun off their American counterparts–the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. The Bilderbergers are their creation. Hundreds of humanistic study institutes in the U. S. also promote their theories.
The Committee of 300 is comprised of a hierarchy of the Freemasons, the American Eastern Liberal “Establishment,” the European Nobility, the Order of Skull and Bones and the Illuminati.
Their interest is in the eradication of the middle class. They desire only rulers and servants. “No national boundaries” is their mantra. The U. S. Constitution is a major stumbling block for these people.
Stalin kept the USSR heavily armed with conventional and nuclear forces because he did not trust this group. Putin understands the threat as well and has brought the Soviet Union to an apex of nuclear strategic capability.
Some researchers get off track since the Intel agencies of several countries encourage and promote off-the-wall groups, such as New Age, Zen Buddhism and Yoga. These are not the prime focus; these are distractions.
MI6 as it’s currently operated dates back in time to 1911. It was under the leadership of Sir Mansfield Cumming, formerly a captain in the Royal Navy. He was always identified by the letter “C.” The “M” in James Bond began from this bit of history.
The New World Order controls, through huge South African conglomerates, world diamond mining and gold sales and distribution. They predominantly control titanium, copper, iron-ore, uranium, platinum and other precious metals and minerals, many of which have major strategic value.
The Committee of 300 is the only power in the world today that transcends all governments. I could name a prominent think-tank they control here in the U. S., but you probably know who it is. This think-tank controls U.S. policies at multiple levels.
Why do some of these people call themselves “Illuminati?” Adam Weishaupt was a Jesuit professor of canon law when he founded this movement. It is derived from Lucifer and means “holder of light.”
A Rhodes scholarship therefore can be viewed as a portal through which this European philosophy is transmitted to individuals of “promise” who qualify.
I believe Jack Kennedy, during his term of office as President of the U. S., at some point became a Christian and all of this was revealed to him by close advisers. He tried in vain to warn the people of the U.S. twice that the Office of the President was manipulated by the Council on Foreign Relations / Illuminati. He put a temporary stop to the “borrowing” of Federal Reserve notes from the Federal Reserve Bank and began issuing U.S. notes (interest-free), based on the credit of the United States. It was this action, among others, that caused him to become a target of the New World Order.
The New World Order prefers men in high office who are stooges, without honor and scruple, and most of all without conscience. Some of these men are obviously vulnerable to blackmail. I can think of a number of them; that way they are easy to manipulate.
The intelligence community’s media assets are extensive; do a search on Operation Mockingbird if you want to find out how extensive they are.

Conservative students at the University of California, Berkeley, say they are being stalked, threatened and bullied by far-left leaning thugs, some armed with baseball bats.
UC Berkeley College Republicans (BCR) told Fox News they are being targeted by Antifa, most recently with Twitter ""doxxing,"" a practice of publishing personal information online, and restroom graffiti that read “Kill All BCRs,” which UCPD spokesperson Sgt. Sabrina Reich said is currently under investigation.
BCR Vice President Naweed Tahmas said they are “routinely harassed and have been chased, punched, stalked and spat on,” which he views as a sign of desperation from the left.
“It has become socially acceptable in Berkeley to physically beat someone for being conservative,” Tahmas added.
Student Ashton Whitty told Fox News that Antifa thugs wore black masks and attacked her car with lead pipes at an off-campus speech rally in August.
“I was then informed Antifa had members on each block tracking me using their cellphones,” Whitty said.
The Antifa Twitter account has a history of aggressive, intimidating behavior toward conservatives on and off campus, BCR insiders say. They have also publicly named and shamed a number of Republican students.
“At this point there is no information or evidence suggesting the perpetrators are students or affiliated with the university,” said UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof. “But we can guarantee that all leads will be followed so we can make every effort to impose consequences on those responsible.”
Mogulof said the university condemns “without reservation” the targeting of students.
“This university cannot and will not tolerate the harassment of its students, particularly when they are being targeted simply as a result of who they are or what they believe in,” he said.
Young America’s Foundation (YAF) spokesperson Spencer Brown told Fox News that YAF staff and BCR members were “followed by Antifa thugs"" while they were hanging posters on campus.
YAF and Berkeley went back and forth in their efforts to have conservative speakers on campus, given the security concerns after violent protesters shut down Milo Yiannopoulis’ scheduled speech in February.
""In the months leading up to YAF’s campus lecture with Ben Shapiro [on Sept. 14], Berkeley’s administration chose to allow Antifa agitators to shut down several other conservative events [including planned YAF lectures with David Horowitz and Ann Coulter] without holding the thugs responsible for destroying property,” Brown said.
""The YAF spokesman is either confused, ill-informed or intentionally mangling the facts,"" Mogulof said. ""Mr. Horowitz had an event scheduled on campus last spring, security arrangements had been made and everything was good to go.""
Mogulof said Pieter Sittler, BCR vice president at the time of the event, stated that the Horowitz talk was canceled due to ""low expected turnout"" and not because of Antifa.
'The university's response has been pathetic at best.'
Mogulof added that only one event -- featuring Yiannopoulis -- has been shut down by Antifa since last February.
While the administration said they are doing all they can to protect and defend free speech, the Berkeley College Republicans targeted by Antifa don’t feel the same way.
“The university’s response has been pathetic at best,” said student Matt Ronnau, a BCR member.
“Time and time again the university has bent over backward to protect the feelings of supposed adults, while providing no actual physical safety to the conservative minority on campus,"" he added. ""It is unfortunate that the city of such a great college has been overrun by a lawless, anti-American, domestic terrorist organization.”
“It is a sad day when exercising our constitutional right to free speech … means we have to face months of stalking, harassment and even violence,” said Troy Worden, a conservative student at UC Berkeley.
“I have to look behind my shoulder whenever I am on campus and especially when I am engaged in political activism,” Worden told Fox News.
“The No. 1 public university in the world and the so-called ‘birthplace of the free speech movement’ is anything but. It is the place where America’s conservative youth are daily under threat of violence, lacking the support of the university administration, police, or city. The Free Speech Movement is dead, and the left has killed it.”

"Bill O’Reilly, the former Fox News presenter, had a clause in his contract that meant he could not be fired over harassment allegations unless they were proved in court.
The revelation was made by Jacques Nasser, an independent director of Fox, during a hearing with the Competition and Markets Authority about its investigation into 21st Century Fox’s 11.7bn takeover of Sky.
O’Reilly’s employment agreement will increase concerns about 21st Century Fox’s handling of a sexual harassment scandal at Fox News. The scandal eventually led to the sacking of O’Reilly, who denies the allegations, and the departure of Roger Ailes, the former boss of Fox News, who has since died.
The sexual harassment scandal at Fox News has dogged Fox’s attempt to buy Sky and created more opposition to the deal. The CMA is investigating the deal on the grounds of media plurality and commitment to broadcasting standards.
The CMA’s notes about the meeting with Nasser, the former head of the car maker Ford, were published on Wednesday.
According to the notes, Nasser said that when the board of Fox was informed of several harassment allegations against Ailes it had not been made aware of them before and reacted “quickly”, with Ailes leaving within days and several other senior figures leaving in the following months.
However the situation was “different” when the board of Fox was informed of the allegations against O’Reilly. “This was in part related to there being an employment agreement with Bill O’Reilly which stated he could not be dismissed on the basis of an allegation unless that allegation was proved in court,” the CMA said of the meeting with Nasser. “Further, at the time of the allegations being raised, the evidence was uncertain.”
Nasser said the board was aware that O’Reilly had made settlements with accusers but did not know the value of the settlements.
Some board members wanted to dismiss O’Reilly immediately, he added, while others wanted to wait for his contract to be renewed.
According to Nasser, when Fox then renewed O’Reilly’s contract, “the board ensured that a clause was inserted to state that he could be dismissed on the grounds of an allegation against him without it having to be proved in court”.
Fox was criticised last month after the New York Times revealed that O’Reilly agreed a $32m (24m) settlement with one accuser last January and that the company knew about it when they offered him a contract extension the next month.
Fox confirmed at the time that it knew about the settlement, but said the financial terms were not disclosed and that new contract with O’Reilly “added protections for the company specifically aimed at harassment, including that Mr O’Reilly could be dismissed if the company was made aware of other allegations or if additional relevant information was obtained in a company investigation”.
O’Reilly left Fox News in April 2017, two months after the contract was agreed.
Nasser told the CMA that “with the benefit of hindsight” the Fox board should have known about the allegations against O’Reilly earlier.
The CMA notes said: “JN [Nasser]acknowledged that perhaps, with the benefit of hindsight, there could have been better governance structures in place at Fox News to ensure that the board came to know of allegations at an earlier stage.
“However, he confirmed that changes had subsequently been made to address this. JN stated that it is never easy to ascertain what the best governance structure for a company is and in his experience different companies have different processes in place as suits the nature of the business operations.
“JN stated that as a result of the sexual harassment allegations, the 21CF [Fox] board has now implemented processes and structures to ensure allegations are escalated to the board quicker and to change the culture within the entire company to prevent harassment from occurring in the first place. He added that, in his view, it would not be conceivable that anyone at 21CF or Fox News would now believe that he or she may misbehave with impunity.”",0

"Google insiders have been warning that Google’s top priority is gaining “outright censorship” of the internet.
They also say that employees has been intimidated into silence, though many of them known as the “rebels of Google” have decided to speak out
Another area of the Internet where widespread censorship is also taking place is YouTube, the Google-owned video sharing website
YouTube revealed on their official blog recently that they would be taking action to censor what they consider to be “hate speech” and “violent extremism.” And now they have already started.
Recently, a Google employee who goes by the alias “Hal” spoke to Breitbart News about the political bias that allegedly runs rampant throughout the company. Hal’s interview with Breitbart is the first in a series entitled “Rebels of Google,” which will be published in full within the next few days.
In the interview, Hal, who understandably chose to use a fake name out of fear of losing his job, spoke about the ongoing effort within Google to suppress certain content that the company doesn’t want the public to have easy access to.
“Many people now fear that Google, Facebook and other companies are moving to control and censor their content. Are these fears justified?” asked Breitbart reported Allum Bokhari. “That is absolutely what Google is trying to do,” Hal replied. “The pro-censorship voices are very loud, and they have the management’s ear. The anti-censorship people are afraid of retaliation, and people are afraid to openly support them because everyone in their management chain is constantly signaling their allegiance to far-left ideology. Our leadership (Sundar in particular) is weak, so he capitulates to the meanest bullies on the block.”
The news is particularly damning to conservatives, who in recent years have been working to establish a stronghold on the Internet considering the fact that all other outlets, from the mainstream media to Hollywood, are run by leftists. A prominent example of this is Mark Levin’s LevinTV, which is an Internet-based conservative program launched last year that puts out new episodes every weeknight. If Google is actively working to censor ideas and information that do not align with the progressive ideology, conservative voices on the Internet could be in serious trouble.",1
"Slow Down, Everyone, You're Moving Too Fast
Three examples of when stopping to think would save businesses and society from a bad reaction.
For Lucky Whitehead, the past two weeks must have been surreal. Whitehead, a wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys, was released (that is, fired) by the team after reports surfaced that he had been accused of shoplifting in Virginia and then failed to show up for a court date, leading to the issuance of a warrant for his arrest. Whitehead protested that he had not been in Virginia at the time, but the team turned a deaf ear to his pleas. As matters turned out, he was telling the truth. The local police admitted that the suspect was somebody else, who had given them Whitehead’s name. No matter, said the Cowboys. He had been in trouble a little too often. The team did not want him back. About the same time, Olive Garden was being forced to apologize, abjectly and publicly, for a threatening email to a pasta lover who was blogging about his experiences eating his way through the restaurant chain’s entire menu. Although the email purported to be from the legal department, it appears to have been generated by a bot that crawls the web looking for misuses of the company’s trademarks. The bot discovered the words “Olive Garden” pasted all over the blog, and the email followed. As a result, the chain was inundated by unfavorable publicity.And then there’s this week’s wave of internet delight over the “news” that psychiatrists had been suddenly set free from the strictures of the Goldwater rule, the ethical precept that prohibits comment on the mental status of public figures whom the doctors themselves have never examined. But nothing of the sort had occurred. Social medianites (perhaps inspired by misleading headlines) had misunderstood a statement by the American Psychoanalytic Association, a group that is unrelated to the American Psychiatric Association, which promulgated the Goldwater rule.
What these examples have in common is that in each case the error stemmed from the felt need to act in haste. People acted from different motives, but they all reacted much too fast to news they should have taken time to digest. Outside the realm of the abstract, when we think fast, we tend to reason poorly.Let’s consider our three examples.Lucky Whitehead: The Cowboys, like most National Football League teams, were intent on separating themselves from any hint of scandal. Just a few years ago, professional sports were beleaguered by charges that they tended to soft-pedal or even cover up misfeasance by their players. Now they try to be squeaky clean, often releasing the accused long before the allegations have been investigated.
The predictable effect is to punish the innocent in the effort to get the guilty.
Olive Garden: Worried like every company about misuse of its trademarks but unable to police the vastness of the web, Olive Garden evidently uses a bot to find offending sites. Makes sense. But the rest of the process asks for trouble. The automatically generated threatening email is chilly and without any understanding of nuance. Had human beings been involved, and taken the time to think, they would have realized that the existence of the site -- it’s called AllofGarden.com (get it?) -- is a boon to the company.
Instead, what ensued was mockery and bad publicity.The Goldwater Rule: One is not sure quite what to say. What actually happened was this: The American Psychoanalytic Association (abbreviated APsaA, which looks like a typographical error) informed its roughly 3,500 members via email that the group was not going to change its stance against commenting as an organization on public figures, and reminding them that the Goldwater Rule applies only to members of the American Psychiatric Association. This represented no change in policy by anybody, but news sites and social media erupted with delight at the tidings that psychiatrists could now comment on President Donald Trump’s mental status. If not for the felt need of editors to stay ahead of the information curve, reporters could easily have tracked down the truth before the story hit screens. As for social media, well, that particular barn door can never quite be closed. (APsaA made a desperate effort to slow down the storm on Twitter, but that cat had left the barn before they could get their boots on to clean up the spilled milk.)
All of these errors arose because of the felt need for instant response. Yet when we think fast, we reason poorly. Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman’s brilliant 2011 best-seller “Thinking, Fast and Slow” divides our processes into what he calls System 1 and System 2. System 1 is swift and intuitive and almost unconscious in its responses; System 2 is cautious and plodding and analytical. System 1 has occasional advantages. For example, expertise gained through repetition resides there. (Think firefighters and chess masters.) But System 1 is also home to most of our cognitive biases. System 2 is engaged more rarely, and apparently requires more of our energy. (Kahneman describes it as lazy.) It is deliberative, weighing evidence and argument. It is the home of logic and reasoning, deductive reasoning in particular.
Clear thinking from leading voices in business, economics, politics, foreign affairs, culture, and more.
Of course we need System 1. Without it we would never be able to drive a car, judge a tone of voice or hit a baseball. But some decisions are important enough that they should always engage System 2 -- the part of the mind that reasons. Our three examples involve decisions on whether to discharge an employee, accuse a bystander of trademark infringement,
or share the “news” of a change in a major psychiatric policy. None is so trivial that it should be left to an immediate reaction.Social media cannot be reined in. It exists in a sort of hemi-world where instant, often emotional, responses are the norm.
(Yes, you’re right, the president of the United States does provide the best example.) Politics, too, seems unlikely to be rescued from the grip of passion and instinctive response.But businesses for profit like the Cowboys and Olive Garden should do better. The immediate costs of their errors for acting too fast may at first be cast on others, as Lucky Whitehead and a guy who just likes pasta found out. But the long-run cost is to reputation. And that’s something a business can’t afford to lose.

Atlantic hurricane season 2017: What you should know
Hurricane Maria was downgraded to a Category 2 storm late Wednesday afternoon. Another hurricane, Jose, remains offshore and was downgraded to a tropical storm as it headed toward New England.
Irma earlier tore through South Florida,making landfall Sept. 10as a Category 4 hurricane after leaving a deadly path of destruction in the Caribbean, the National Hurricane Center said.
That hurricane came on the heels of Hurricane Harvey, which slammed Texas and Louisiana in late August.
The hurricane season for the Atlantic -- which started June 1 -- will continue through the end of November. Here's what you should know about the potential coming storms.
What sort of hurricane season is expected?
Before Harvey hit, theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)issued an updated outlook for the Atlantic hurricane season on Aug. 9.
“Forecasters are now predicting a higher likelihood of an above-normal season, and they increased the predicted number of named storms and major hurricanes,” the agency said.
""The season,"" it said, ""has the potential to be extremely active, and could be the most active since 2010.""
How many storms are predicted?
The August outlook expected 14 to 19 named storms and two to five major hurricanes for the season -- more than NOAA had earlier predicted.
“A prediction for 5-9 hurricanes remains unchanged from the intial May outlook,” it said.
Hurricanes have winds reaching 74 mph or more, while major hurricanes have winds hitting 111 mph or more, the agencyexplained online.
""An average season produces 12 named storms of which six become hurricanes, including three major hurricanes,"" according to the agency.
What kind of El Nio is predicted?
El Nio is the ""warming of the ocean surface, or above-average sea surface temperatures (SST), in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean,"" according toNOAA climate.gov.
Atlantic hurricane activity is usually lowered by El Nio, theAssociated Pressreported.
Gerry Bell, a lead seasonal hurricane forecaster with NOAA, said in an August statement that ""the chance of an El Nino forming, which tends to prevent storms from strengthening, has dropped significantly from May.""
WHAT IS THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON HURRICANE WIND SCALE?
What are the 2017 Atlantic tropical cyclone names?
Arlene, Bret, Cindy, Don, Emily, and Lee have all been used for tropical storms. Harvey, Franklin, Gert, Irma, Jose, Katia and Maria have been used for hurricanes.
What should you do to prepare for a storm?
""Have a family discussion about what you will do, where you will go and how you will communicate with each other when a storm threatens; Know your evacuation route; tune into your local news or download the FEMA app to get alerts, and finally – listen to local authorities as a storm approaches,"" he said.

"A koi pond was all it took on Monday to reaffirm the oft-provenbelief that the mainstream media is not a societal organism to be trusted. The long and short of it is that CNN, one of the mainstream media sources on the block, reported that Trump disrespectfully dumped fish food from a box into a koi pond while hanging out with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The footage showed by CNN was deceptively edited. It showed Trump dumping his food into the koi pond with a smile on his face. What it didn’t show was Abe doing the same thing first.
CNN took the lowest road possible by editing an already available video of Abe then Trump dumping their food, and trying to pass off an easily disprovable edited video featuring Trump being idiotic, disrespectful, and callous all in the same go.
Now we all know CNN has been throwing something of a prolonged temper tantrum since Trump’s election, but what’s sad is that they’re not the only network. The big dogs, ABC, CBS, and NBC have also been throwing every accusation they can possibly dream up at anybody with an R next to their name, not just since Trump’s election, but since time immemorial.
Even before Trump’s 2016 victory, the Media Research Center found that 91 percent of Trump’s campaign coverage was negative.The problem hasn’t gotten any better. NBC reported roundaboutly on its own bias by pointing out a report that found Trump is receivingthree times more negative news than Obama.
Even the New York Times was caught swimming in their own muck recently when an editor confessed to the paper attempted to sway people from Trump during the election.
But the news doesn’t have to be about Trump. Pick a cause Republicans or the right, in general, are fond of, and you’ll find a slime-filledmire of biased employees and reporting. A top CBS legal executive was caught celebrating the Las Vegas shooting because she figured that a country music concert must have been filled with Republicans. CBS was later caught trying to falsely paint the NRA’s self-defense insurance as “murder insurance,” by interviewing anti-gun groups and not actually reaching out to the NRA at all for the facts.
All this to say that the media is obviously filthy with leftism, and we’re reminded of that daily…possibly even hourly. Even NPR’s former CEO — now not so much a leftist anymore — straight up confessedthis recently.
So we know they’re biased. The writing is on the pixelated wall in big, bold red font.
Their reaction? To push self-descriptions of unbiased, truthful reporting despite the hulking mass of leftism growing out of their back.
CNN is giving us promo videos about people calling apples “bananas,” but how they’re above all that. WaPo’s “we’re totally truthful and stuff” sounding tagline is “democracy dies in darkness.” The New York Times is passing social media guidelines to their journalists to stop them from exposing their obvious leftist bias.
Allow me to say something that I’ve been saying about myself for eons: I know I’m biased. I freely admit to my bias. I actually take pride in my bias because I believe my stances are moral and just. It’s always been my hope that by admitting this to my readers, and encouraging them to go read my opponent’s writing as well, that despite my personal takes you can trust me in many a regard.
I’m never going try to sell you on the idea that I’m an unbiased journalistjust here to give you the facts and nothing else. It would be an obvious lie, disproved by a quick glance at my writing history and Twitter feed. I do this not just to maintain a sense of ethics, but because trying to pull off an unbiased facade would just look stupid.
And that’s the current look the mainstream media is sporting.
The simple fact that they aren’t admitting to an obvious bias makes them seem stupid, and furthermore, that they’re obvious liars. It’s why, during the election, trust in the media had fallen to an all-time low. It’s why even now, almost half of Americans believe mainstream stories about Trump are simply made up.
This goes beyond just looking stupid, though. Far beyond.
Not everyone understands that the mainstream media is biased, and the consistent negativity is having a horrendous effect. Senators are being shot at during baseball practice. Riots in the streets are occurring with people claiming one group is out to harm another. Criminals in high positions are getting away with crimes that they should be punished severely for, yet no one knows about.
Biased mainstream reporting masked as the truth is literally killing our society, and it’s adding to the hostility the mainstream media — and by extension, other journalists — is experiencing by the general public. Furthermore, it’s adding to the hostility we are showing each other.
Admitting this bias would go a long way to begin healing the damage done to the mainstream press. Why this hasn’t happened yet probably has a lot of reasons behind it — most of it financial — but it needs to happen soon.
If you haven’t seen it, I suggest you watch Prager U’s recent video on this very subject.

"Kim Jong-un has launched the North Korean version of Facebook, creating a clone of the social media platform for citizens to freely use.
An anonymous engineer created the platform as a means of giving people in North Korea the ability to keep in touch with friends and family in a country where many websites, including Facebook, are censored.
Based on media reports we gathered, this new social media launched in North Korea looks exactly like Facebook. It has been named theBest Korea’s Social Network.
The homepage has a thin blue banner at the top with a search field for “people, #hashtags, !groups.”After registration, users can upload a cover photo and profile picture, find friends and message them. Users can also post a status message and scroll through a News Feed just like Facebook. Below is a screen shot of a profile on Best Korea’s Social Network taken by CNN Money.
According to CNN Money, a researcher at DYN, Doug Madory, first discovered Best Korea’s Social Network. DYN is a company that monitors Internet use and access around the world.
After discovering it, Madory then decided to trace where the server is located. He finally traced the server to North Korea. Mr Madory explained that the cloned site was created using phpDolphin, a template-based software system that allows people to build a clone of Facebook. The site is also said to be filled with lots of placeholder Lorem Ipsum text. However, publicly available Internet records could not identify the person or entity that created the website.
It is reported that at a point, the homepage was full of photos of the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un as the boy from “Up in the Air.” There were also some few phony accounts posing as Kim Jong Un.
According to Mr Madory, it is possible that someone in North Korea created the social media as a test. He also revealed that North Korea websites are hosted in China, making what he discovered very strange.
He was quoted as saying “It’s very unusual to have websites hosted in North Korea. Many North Korean sites are hosted in China. I am not sure this was an official North Korean government project. But someone inside the country had to have done this.”
North Korea’s state media has not commented on the creation of the new social media platform. No official in government, too, has commented on it. It is unclear when exactly the social media was launched, or how many people have already signed up as at now.
It is believed that North Korea’s military has formed a highly skilled and well-resourced cyber warfare unit. It is also said that the Communist country has released its own desktop computer operating system known as Red Star OS, which is a heavily restricted version of Linux.
Since the discovery about the Facebook clone was made, some observers have put forward some assumptions.
The International Business Times UK reports that one possibility is that North Korea is testing a social network for the country. This assumption is taken from what Cuba has done. The communist country is said to have created its own Facebook clone that works only within the Caribbean nation. Currently, Best Korea’s Social Network is open to everyone, but it is predicted that access could be restricted to only those inside North Korea at a later date.",1
"We are now all aware that ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC are all liberal news stations with the goal of destroying Donald Trump, the President of the US. They wouldn’t know the truth if it stared them in the face. Sean Hannity knows this so well, and that is why on Friday he exposed who of the mainstream media reporters are in particular responsible for lying to the American people and creating a bad picture about President Trump.
Hannity went after CNN President Jeff Zucker and NBC News/MSNBC Chairman Andy Lack, calling them the “fake news chiefs” who are the architects of the “Destroy Trump Media.”
The Fox News host began his Friday night “mini-monologue” by referring to CNN President Jeff Zucker and NBC News Chairman Andy Lack as the “fake news chiefs” and the architects of the “Destroy Trump Media.” He referred to Jeff Zucker as a “New York elitist” and pulled a quote he gave back in March which he said, “It’s really the Renaissance of journalism in America because of the nature of what’s going on.”
“Really? The ‘Renaissance of journalism’?” he said, while he showed clips of specific instances of their over-the-top, unhinged reporting. He asked: “Jeff Zucker, are you really proud? Are you really believing that that is the ‘Renaissance of journalism?”
He then turned to Andy Lack. He said: “So has Andy Lack succeeded in restoring credibility over at NBC News? We report you decide.”
Facts are facts, they can’t be changed or altered. Neither can the truth. The left continually alters and twists the truth. This is so sad, the lies and nonsense these news media spots each day!! However, I don’t remember them treating Barrack Obama this way. They praised everything he did as the greatest things that had ever been done.
Fox News’ Sean Hannity ripped the mainstream media by stating the obvious! If this doesn’t wake anyone up to stop watching these fake news I don’t know what will!

"We ssssssssssmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeelllllllyour corruption, George Soros. It was only a matter of time before George Soros comes under any scrutiny.
The ultra-liberal mega-donor has caught the scrutiny of the U. S. lawmakers. According to Fox News, there are concerns with Soros after the Hungarian prime minister lashed out at Soros “empire” and accused it of deploying “tons of money and international heavy artillery.”
*** Some people consider George Soros an economic terrorist! SHARE if you agree.
Former Macedonian PM Nikola Gruesvski says that Soros has a “decisive influence” on his politics.
“If it were not for George Soros behind it with all the millions he pours into Macedonia, the entire network of NGOs, media, politicians, inside and out … the economy would be stronger, we would have had more new jobs,” Gruesvski said in a recent interview with Macedonia’s Republika newspaper.
George Soros has been accused of destroying our nation. Many people have said over and over again that this man wants to destroy our borders.
There’s a new sheriff in town now, Soros.

"In addition to the 47 volcanoes already known to be currently “sleeping” under the Arctic ice, scientists have found more. They discovered 91 additional volcanoes in Antartica, making it now the largest volcanic region on earth. This is a big blow to those who think melting polar ice is the sole fault of humans.
The projectby Edinburgh University researchershas revealed almost 100 new volcanoes. The highest discovered volcano is as tall as the Eiger, which stands at almost 4,000 meters(over 13,000 ft) and is a popular peak to traverse in the Swiss Alps. Before this discovery,the densest concentration of volcanoes in the world was that of east Africa’s volcanic ridge. Geologists say this huge region in Antartica is likely to dwarf that of Africa.
You won’t read about this in the mainstream media. Because volcanic eruptions may not reach the surface in Antartica, but they definitly melt the ice from beneath and drastically destabilize the entire region. No amount of carbon tax or global warming initiative would stop a volcano from melting polar ice, butthat likely won’t stop alarmists from blaming volcanic activity on global warming.
A quick glance at the map below, put out by Plate Climatology, shows that the melting glacial ice is indeed caused by volcanic activity under the Arctic ice and not global warming or human induced climate change, as most would like us to believe.
The activity of this range could have worrying consequences, [scientists] have warned. “If one of these volcanoes were to erupt it could further destabilize west Antarctica’s ice sheets,” said glacier expert Robert Bingham, one of the paper’s authors. “Anything that causes the melting of ice – which an eruption certainly would – is likely to speed up the flow of ice into the sea.“The big question is: how active are these volcanoes? That is something we need to determine as quickly as possible.” –The Guardian
The Edinburgh volcano survey reported in theGeological Society’sspecial publications series. They said the research involved studying the underside of the West Antarctica ice sheet. The researchers were looking for hidden peaks of basalt rock similar to those produced by the region’s other volcanoes. Their tips actually lie above the ice and have been spotted by polar explorers over the past century. To find out how many of these “hidden peaks” lie below the ice, the study analyzed measurements made by previous surveys, which involved the use of ice-penetrating radar, carried either by planes or land vehicles, to survey strips of the West Antarctic ice.
The results were then compared with satellite and database records and geological information from other aerial surveys. “Essentially, we were looking for evidence of volcanic cones sticking up into the ice,” Bingham said. After doing all the research and comparing data, scientists came up with an additional 91 volcanoes, all of which are currently covered in ice which sometimes lies in layers that are more than 4km (almost 2 and a half miles) thick in the region. All of which are in the region where Arctic ice is melting too. These active peaks are concentrated in a region known as the West Antarctic rift system, which stretches 3,500km (about 2175 miles) from Antarctica’s Ross ice shelf to the Antarctic peninsula.
“We were amazed,” Bingham said. “We had not expected to find anything like that number. We have almost trebled the number of volcanoes known to exist in west Antarctica. We also suspect there are even more on the bed of the sea that lies under the Ross ice shelf, so that I think it is very likely this region will turn out to be the densest region of volcanoes in the world, greater even than east Africa, where mounts Nyiragongo, Kilimanjaro, Longonot and all the other active volcanoes are concentrated.”
Scientists claim that there could be huge implications for life on earth if one of these massive volcanoes decided to go off, melting enormous amounts of Arctic ice. The biggest implication is perhaps howbad this news is for governments around the globe raking in billions of dollars to combat climate change. Without humans being the cause of the ice melt, who would the governments tax? It’s hard to tax a volcano…

"CBS News has learned Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein made a last-ditch effort to save his career. He sent a letter asking several movie industry executives for support just hours before he was fired from his company. Weinstein wrote, ""I am desperate for your help."" The letter was first reported by the Hollywood Reporter's Janice Min and then confirmed by CBS News.
CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan sat down with a journalist who shared her encounter with Weinstein. Ten years ago, Lauren Sivan met Weinstein in mixed company at a dinner party, but when he offered her a private tour of his restaurant, she says she was ""stunned"" by the encounter.
""When he asked me if I wanted a tour of the restaurant or the kitchen -- no, there was no apprehension. Should there have been? Yes,"" Sivan said.
It was 2007, and Sivan said she got ""a very friendly vibe"" from Weinstein.
""I didn't get anything that read he was dangerous until we got downstairs,"" Sivan said. ""He tried to kiss me. And I pushed him off, politely, and that's when he seemed to get angry or annoyed and told me to just stand there and be quiet.""
Sivan said Weinstein had her cornered.
""He exposed himself and he basically pleasured himself. And when he finished, I said to him, are we done here, can I leave? Because he had been blocking the exit,"" Sivan said. ""I just wanted to leave and hopefully never see him again.""
Several actors who were hired by Weinstein have spoken out against him, including Meryl Streep -- who told the Huffington Post ""the behavior is inexcusable.""
But Weinstein was defended by fashion icon Donna Karan.
""It's not Harvey Weinstein, you look at everything all over the world today, you know, and how women are dressing you know, and what they're asking by just presenting themselves the way they do, what are they asking for? Trouble,"" Karan said on Sunday.
Karan apologized Monday, saying ""My statements were taken out of context and do not represent how I feel...I am truly sorry to anyone that I offended.""
""I don't believe going to the police would have accomplished anything,"" Sivan said.
While Sivan says she's received overwhelming support, she said some have been critical of her for not speaking out sooner.
""I don't like that idea of blaming the victim. Blame him, you know. Blame the people that enabled him,"" she said.
George Clooney told the Daily Beast Weinstein's behavior is ""indefensible."" He said, ""This is the moment to start scaring people like this into not acting this way anymore.""
CBS News has repeatedly reached out to Harvey Weinstein and the Weinstein Company for comment, but has not heard back.",0

Courtney C. Radsch is one of the earliest proponents of the political impact of cyberactivism in the Middle East and analysts of Arab media. She defines citizen journalism “as an alternative and activist form of newsgathering and reporting that functions outside mainstream media institutions, often as a response to shortcomings in the professional journalistic field, that uses similar journalistic practices but is driven by different objectives and ideals and relies on alternative sources of legitimacy than traditional or mainstream journalism”.",1
"It's August, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been to Tuva -- the place where he is usually photographed shirtless. The slow news cyclecertainly accounts for some ofthe attention that the latest Kremlin-released photo session has received from global media. But something else accounts for most of it: Putin'sincredible success as a troll.
Not just the paparazzi-loving tabloids published whole photo galleries from the selection:The New York Times,The Washington Postand Time did, too. Few heads of state could boast of similar success with their government news products. The achievement is especially impressive given that Putin was already photographed shirtless in the South Siberian region on the Mongolian border in 2007and2009(on another fishing trip to the region,in 2013, it was probably too cold for the shirt to come off, but Putin still got the social networks excited by kissing a large pike he'd caught).
All of Putin's famous shirtless pictures -- on horseback, pole-fishing, swimming the butterfly stroke -- come from vacations in Tuva, the birthplace of his Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. The region's natural beauty and remoteness -- no one can see him who's not supposed to -- appear to bring out a kind of macho, outdoorsy romanticism in the pale-skinned St. Petersburg native, who's lived in big cities his whole life. But why does the Kremlin keep publishing the photos, and why do the global media lap them up so?
The obvious answer to the first question is that Putin is selling his impressive physique-- particularly for a man of 65 with a sedentary job-- to the domestic audience. As safe as he may feel about the 2018 election, which will be a mockery of democracy like manybefore it, he seems interested in convincing voters that he remains the virile man who took over the government some 17 years ago. Indeed, there's no sign of physical deterioration in the latest photos compared with the 2007one, at least according to MK, the Moscow tabloid. On Sunday, itcomparedPutin sarcastically to Indiana Jones, concluding wryly, ""How can one not vote for such a torso?""
But then, both Putin and his press service know that Russians, even the majority who aren't opposed to Putin, will take the images with a grain of salt. They usually cause outbreaks of hilarity on the social networks; many of the jokes and memes are unflattering (myfavorite one from the latest batch has Putin preparing to dive into an enormous muddy puddle on the edge of some Russian city, with school kids wading nearby, up to their ankles in water). Even official publications often join the fun. After Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary, said Putin had chased this year's Tuva pike for two hours before spearing it, the Russian government's newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, teasedthe news on Twitter with a collageof sprinter Usain Bolt with a pike's head.
Even Russia's fishing enthusiasts, of which there are many, didn't hesitate to call Putinan amateur for a number of reasons: chasing a fish is not the best tactic; a pike is best taken with a pole, not a spear; that Putin's catch was smallish; and that his underwater swimming technique left much to be desired.
Putin isn't impressing too many Russians with these exploits, not with his hockey goal-scoring prowessnor with his carefully staged judo displays. Russians are used to leaders presenting themselves as superhuman in various ways; I was raised on stories about how Vladimir Lenin's brain had a different physical structure that made his extraordinary level of genius possible. A near-universal sarcastic attitude toward this kind of deification has survived the Soviet era and persists today. Putin doesn't run Russia on the basis of a personality cult, but rather by force and cunning. The Kremlin doesn't publish the pictures in an attempt to create such a cult: It's done so before and it knows the tepid domestic effect.
It appears increasingly likely that the Kremlin comes out with the macho imagerymainly for Western audiences' sake. They appear to be fascinated by shirtless Putin, and Western media use the images for years to illustrate stories about the Russian president; even the most sycophantic pro-Kremlin media have stopped recyclingthe 2007 and 2009 pictures.
There's a song about Putin on Randy Newman's latest album, with lyrics that go:
And when he takes his shirt off,
When he takes his shirt off,
That's irony, of course, but a very different kindfrom those memes in Russia. Westerners don't think of Putin preparing to dive into a car-sized pothole filled with water. Theyappear to be mesmerized by what they see as a display of machismo and bad taste, but also bad-boy physical power. The images reinforce Putin's image as the man Western media love to hate. At any rate, that's what it looks like to people who run the Kremlin propaganda machine.
""I read the NYT report about Putin's vacation,"" Margarita Simonyan, head of the propaganda channel RT, tweeted. ""It's love, of course. A frustrated, angry kind. Because it's unrequited.""
I doubt that toomany Americans are interested in comparing muscular Putin withnearly-obese Donald Trump, who eats junk food and likes to ride in a golf cart even on the green. After all, Americans who like Putin mainly voted for Trump. But Russia's communication with the Western world is not aboutcreating an attractive image. It's about mockery and trolling. A shirtless Putin in dark glasses, floating in the middle of a remote Siberian lake, is not a guy who cares much about U. S. Congress' latest sanctions. While U.S. intelligence services worry about Russian spear-phishing as a way of getting intoAmerican networks, Putin spear-fishes for pike.
Western media don't have to play along. But it's August -- and perhaps there's a little of that unrequited love. Come on, colleagues, you can do better than that -- how about a spread of Angela Merkel's holiday pictures? Putin doesn't need any more propping up.

"President Trump said he sees progress in the steps his administration has taken on North Korea, suggesting he could ""make a deal"" with the regime, but would not say whether he still believes direct talks are a waste of time.
""I really believe that it makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and to make a deal,"" the president said in a press conference with South Korean President Moon. ""That's good for the people of North Korea and the people of the world,"" adding that he sees ""certain movement"" in his administration's approach when it comes to pressuring The hermit kingdom to back away from its nuclear program.
The president took a very different tone, departing from his aggressive rhetoric in the past.
""We will together confront North Korea's actions and prevent the North Korea dictator from threatening millions of lives,"" Trump said. ""He's indeed threatening millions of lives so needlessly.""
President Trump called on the international community -- including China and Russia -- to come together in an effort to pressure North Korea to back away from the nuclear brink, calling North Korea's nuclear ambitions a global threat that requires worldwide action.
Trump -- who said he told his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that any negotiations with Kim Jong Un are a waste of time, declined to say whether he still believed that. ""I don't want to say that,"" the president said.
The president has previously said all options –- including diplomatic negotiations -- remain on the table with North Korea in hopes of avoiding military action. Trump in August warned that North Korea would be “met with fire and fury” if it threatens U. S. security.
The president did not rule out military action, but said he hoped the nuclear standoff with North Korea could be resolved through other channels.
""As we work together to resolve this problem using all available tools short of military action, the United States stands prepared to defend itself and its allies using the full range of our unmatched military capabilities if need be,"" Trump said.
While the issue of North Korea’s nuclear ambitions looms large over the entirety of the president’s tour of the region, the visit to Seoul will bring the president within the closest proximity to Pyongyang as he will come this trip.",0

Liberals better think twice before they start hunting for conservative scalps.
Far-left talking head, Rachel Maddow, has lost her first sponsor after the conservative group Media Equalizer launched their campaign, which targets the sponsors of MSNBC’s flagship programs.(via Media Equalizer)
The company LegalZoom.com has blocked all their advertisements from playing on The Rachel Maddow Show, after receiving hundreds of messages from disgruntled customers.
Media Equalizer teamed up with Stop the Scalpings to retaliate against the liberal group Media Matters, which was founded by Hillary Clinton’s longtime ally, David Brook, over a decade ago.
David Brook has engaged in a self-declared “War on Fox News” ever since he founded the progressive watchdog in 2004. Media Matters was behind the recent firing of Bill O’Reilly.
Media Matters is dedicated to silencing any opposition to the Democrat party, and they’re willing to use any tactic required to shut down conservative media personalities.
Earlier this year, Media Matters managed to get Bill O’Reilly firedbased onunproven allegations. They generated a faux outrage — all based on a meritless sexual harassment case. They also targeted O’Reilly’s sponsors.
David Brook was successful, and Bill O’Reilly was forced to leave Fox News. High on his success, Brook immediately launched a campaign targeting both Sean Hannity, and Tucker Carlson’s, advertisers.
Sean Hannity, however, refused to remain passive. The Fox News host partnered with the recently-created group, Stop the Scalpings, to protect conservative opinions. Stop the Scalpings and Media Equalizer used their new platform to launch a retaliation campaign against liberal opinions. If Media Matters is targeting Fox News, then Media Equalizer will target MSNBC.
“We’re fighting fire with fire and we’re winning!” Said Media Equalizer co-founder, Melanie Morgan. “It’s so gratifying to hearLegalZoom.comunderstands how Rachel Maddow’s dishonest and biased reporting doesn’t resonate with their customers. Thank you to all the Stop the Scalpings volunteers who made their voices heard.”
LegalZoom.com is just the beginning. The conservative media watchdogs are organizing over 100,000 volunteers to reach out to a different MSNBC advertisers every day.
We can no longer sit back and take the moral highroad. We need to start using the liberals’ dirty tricks against them. We don’t need to resort to lies and false allegations. We have truth on our side.
Do you think Rachel Maddow will lose her show? Please share the story on Facebook and tell us what you think because we want to hear YOUR voice!",1
"Political Commentator on Fox News Jesse Watters recently appeared on Fox and Friends to slam the Democratic party. Following weeks, even months of criticism the Trump administration received for their alleged conspiracy with Russia to influence the presidential election to favor Trump, now Watters reveals that Democrats have been involved in something similar, and this has been going on for years.
Check out Watters’ comments in the video below.
VIDEO: Jesse Watters shuts Juan Williams up — gives him a history lesson on the DEMOCRATS' connections to Russia! pic.twitter.com/e3E2O330V8
In his searing rant against Juan Williams, Jesse tells us that the Democrats have also been communicating with enemies of the U. S., as Obama provided billions of dollars for Iran and North Korea.
Even the Clinton family received money from Chinese officials in the reelection in 1996 and shared our satellite technology to them, with Hillary also selling large portions of uranium to the Russian government,

"Snopes has been given the power to police Facebook users’ newsfeeds and censor any stories they deem to be ‘fake’.
According to an announcement by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, Facebook will empower a handful of left-wingHillary supportingwebsites to tacklethe so-called‘fake news’ problem on the social media platform.
The consequence of allowing a provably biased fake news blog to decide what users are allowed to see on their own newsfeeds will likely result in the mainstream media stifling dissenting opinions and burying independent media. This is all about silencing competition.
One of Facebook’s “fact checkers” is alsothe Washington Post, who recently had to admit they published aninaccurate “fake news” listlast week.
“To combat fake news, Facebook has partnered with a shortlist of media organizations, including Snopes and ABC News, that are part of an international fact-checking network lead by Poynter, a nonprofit school for journalism located in St. Petersburg, Florida,” reports Business Insider.
“We believe in giving people a voice and that we cannot become arbiters of truth ourselves, so we’re approaching this problem carefully. We’ve focused our efforts on the worst of the worst, on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain, and on engaging both our community and third party organizations,” Facebook vice president Adam Mosseri said in a press release Thursday.
NiemanLab notes that Facebook will be relying on four fact-check organizations: ABC News, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact and Snopes.
In July, TheDC caught Snopes lying about the lack of visible American flags at the first day of the Democratic National Convention, claiming an image from the second day of the convention was actually from the first day, in an attempt to debunk a factual story from TheDC.
Just last week, a Snopes “fact-check” of an investigative piece by The Daily Caller News Foundation was riddled with factual errors and omissions, completely butchering the truth.
Facebook has been under pressure to censor “fake news” — a term which some liberal journalists have applied to their conservative competitors.
Legitimate conservative news organizations like The Blaze or Independent Journal Review (IJR) have been smeared with the fake news label by liberal journalists.",1
"Melania Trump Just Came After The Daily Mail For $150 Million For DISGUSTING Escort Story
The recent ""fake news"" epidemic has swept our nation with force and despite the lefts best efforts to try to discredit right-wing news sites and blame it all on them, liberal news sites continue to publish blatantly false stories and accusations. Melania Trump has been the victim of a number of these slanderous stories, but, now, she said enough is enough, and she's taking the ones responsible to court.
More from The Blaze:
First lady Melania Trump filed a lawsuit against the Daily Mail for publishing “salacious and highly offensive statements about her,” according to CNBC’s Steve Kopack, who tweeted the news Monday.
She is seeking $150 million in compensatory and punitive damages from the news organization for causing “tremendous harm to Plaintiff’s personal and professional reputation.
The statement filed in the New York Supreme Court focuses on a story published by Mail Online on August 19, 2016.
JUST FILED: First Lady Melania Trump sues Daily Mail in NY Supreme Court over ""salacious and highly offensive statements about her"" pic.twitter.com/vwj0sDmgKc
An earlier lawsuit against the news corporation was dismissed from a Maryland when a judge ruled that the matter was outside of the jurisdiction of the court. The lawsuit was filed in August and cited a story that had been published the week previous and insinuated that she had worked as an escort.
…the Daily Mail published a story outlining the former supermodel’s “very racy” past, including Trump’s former romantic relationships, her career in modeling and her immigration story. Pulling details from a magazine in Trump’s native Slovenia, the Daily Mail article claims the modeling agency Trump used to work for was actually an escort service.
The Daily Mail retracted the story after the filing, but it appears that the first lady will continuing pursuing the lawsuit.
Trump posted apologies and retractions from The Inquisitr and the Bipartisan Report after the original lawsuit:

"Seth Doane is a Rome-based correspondent for CBS News. In addition to traveling with Pope Francis and covering the Vatican, Doane’s reportage also includes coverage of the wider region from earthquakes in Italy, to terrorist attacks in France, to the refugee and migrant crisis in the waters of the Mediterranean.
The Peabody Award-winning journalist was previously based in Beijing. During three years as CBS News’ Asia correspondent, Doane covered a wide range of breaking news and feature stories across the region. He made an intrepid journey into the South China Sea to glimpse China’s island-building efforts, traveled into closed-off North Korea twice, and reported from across China on issues from economics, to human rights, to the politics of the ruling Communist Party. In Japan he suited up to go inside reactor four at the nuclear power plant in Fukushima and covered the fallout of the earthquake and tsunami there.
Doane has traveled to around 70 countries and has filed stories from the front lines of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, has covered natural disasters from the tsunami that struck Asia to the earthquake that rattled Haiti. He received the Peabody Award for a trip he took solo to Darfur (shooting, producing and reporting on the humanitarian situation there).
When he was based in New York, Doane traveled extensively across the United States and, for a time, focused on a series titled “The Other America” which chronicled the downturn of the U. S. economy ahead of the “Great Recession.” His reports showed people lining up before dawn for free medical clinics and took viewers inside a restaurant at the moment it had to lay off its employees.
Doane contributes to all CBS News broadcasts and platforms and has reported regularly for “CBS Sunday Morning,” filing feature pieces including stories about gondolas in Venice or leis in Hawaii and also harder issue stories about gun regulations in Australia or life in North Korea.
Before joining CBS News, Doane was the New Delhi, India-based correspondent for CNN International. Doane started his on-camera career at “Channel One News” the in-school television news broadcast which at the time was watched by nearly eight million students each morning.
His first job in TV was with the special projects unit for Fox 5 (WNYW-TV) in New York. While there, Doane was nominated for a local Emmy Award in the investigative category for a report he helped produce about school security -- at the age of 22.
Doane graduated from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California (USC). He graduated in 2000 with a B. A. in Broadcast Journalism. He was born and raised on Cape Cod in Massachusetts where his family has lived for generations.",0
"Moscow has rejected reports by Israeli media that it aims to deploy fighter jets and military personnel to Syria to help the Arab country in its battle against ISIS.
Syrian defense sources also denied the reports concerning the alleged arrival of the Russian jets in Syria, al-Masdar reported.
Press TV reports: : “There has been no redeployment of Russian combat aircraft to the Syrian Arab Republic,” the website of Russia’stelevision networkRT quoted an unnamed source as saying on Tuesday.
“The Russian Air Force is at its permanent bases and carrying out normal troop training and combat duty,” the source added.
Moscow’s rebuttal came a day after Israeli news website Ynetnews claimed that Moscow plans to dispatch thousands of its military personnel to the violence-wracked Arab country “in the coming weeks.”
“Thousands of Russian military personnel are set to touch down in Syria, including advisors, instructors, logistics personnel, technical personnel, members of the aerial protection division, and the pilots who will operate the aircraft,” read the Ynetnewsreport, quoting unnamed Western diplomats.
The report further added that “a Russian expeditionary force” had recently set up an airbase near the Syrian capital Damascus.
Back on August 16, Turkey’s English-language daily BGN News also reported that Moscow had provided Damascus with six Mikoyan MiG-31 fighter jets under a contract inked between the two sides in 2007.
Sergei Korotkov, the head of the Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG, dismissed the report a few days later, saying, “We have not delivered this [type of] aircraft to Syria and are not going to supply them there.”",1
"In 2016, Donald Trump was on set during an interview on 60 Minutes, where he said that he planned to send 2-3 million undocumented immigrants.
He even declared that he may just incarcerate them even though they haven’t committed a crime worthy of prison time. But first, he admitted that his promise to build a wall is full of shit.
When asked if he is still going to “build a wall” along the border, Trump told Leslie Stahl that he would use fencing in “certain areas.”
“For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,” he said. “I’m very good at this, it’s called construction. There could be some fencing.”
And then he told Stahl that he intends to target 2 or 3 million undocumented immigrants whom he claims are “criminals.” Even more alarming is that he is considering just incarcerating them in prisons that would basically be the equivalent of concentration camps.
“We are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,” he said. “After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about who are terrific people, they’re terrific people, but we are going make a determination.”

"Facebook is to launch a “safety check” tool which will allow users to notify their family and friends that they’re safe following a natural disaster or emergency. The feature will be available to the site’s 1.32 billion users.
The internet giant began working on the tool after the Japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The feature could force the expression “No news is good news” to become obsolete.
“We want to provide a helpful tool that people can use when major disasters strike, so we’ve created ‘safety check’ — a simple and easy way to say you’re safe and check on others,” Facebook said in a blog post late Wednesday.
The post also stated that people turned to Facebook in the aftermath of the Japan crisis.
“During that crisis, we saw how people used technology and social media to stay connected with those they cared about.”
Facebook software engineers then built the Disaster Message Board to make it easier for people to communicate with each other. This project metamorphosed into Safety Check.
Safety Check will be available all over the world on desktop, iOS, Android, and feature phones. Subscribers in an area that has been hit by a disaster will be sent a notification asking, “Are you OK?”
Users can then click “I’m safe,” and their friends in the area will receive a notification on their news feed. Friends can also mark a person as safe.
There is no option to respond with a “No” answer. Users will also be unable to say they have survived but are in need of rescue.
Facebook will determine users’ locations by looking at the city they have listed in their profile. The social networking site will also use smartphone locations to work out if someone has been affected by a disaster, although it will allow people to correct any mistakes in this area.
Describing its motivations behind its decision to add the feature, Facebook said: “Unfortunately, these kinds of disasters happen all too frequently. Each time, we see people, relief organizations and first responders turn to Facebook in the aftermath of a major natural disaster.”",1
"Recently a flood of “fake news” stories have been brought to light. Fake news is not just a term used for bald-face lying — blatant deception and editing also falls under this category.
Megyn Kelly recently had the chance to interview Russian President Vladimir Putin.When NBC aired the interview, they edited out aCRUCIAL part where Putin makes a remark about the Flynn investigation. Putin states that Kelly shouldbe put in jail for talking to him if journalistic standards regarding Flynn’s “ties” to Russia were ACTUALLY upheld.
NBCapparently didn’t want that clip to see the light of day because it made them look foolish. What we see here is CLEAR deception by the mainstream media. Instead of reporting fairly, they are bending, twisting, and, in this case, erasing words to make themselves look more credible.
Someone looked at the clip and decided to edit that part out. Surely it was a huge part of the interview that we ALL needed to see, but the MSM didn’t care.
Aline has been drawn in the sand. The media is out to further the agenda of their sponsors, as opposed to actually doing their jobs. We SHOULD NOT have to settle for this “fake news.”
It is interesting that the Left seems to be SO caught up in the ties between Russia, Trump, and Flynn — yet they fail to see that they are doing EXACTLY what they are claiming Trump is doing. You do not get a free pass to do whatever you want because you are the media.
We have always heard that the media is supposed to be the fabled Fourth Estate; anipso factofourth branch of government that keeps everyone else in check. If there is any truth left to this, that last limb has snapped off from the tree.
How did we end up in a situation where we are being lied to on a daily basis? If the news is willing to make significant edits like this to their interviews, then this is just the tip of the iceberg. The American people were only allowed to see the truth because Russian media also reported this story, but THEY showed the edited clip.
Our media is SO watered down by bias that we have to get the facts from the news media in other countries. Is this really what we have become? What happened to credibility in journalism? There are no more standards; it is just a free-for-all of lying and deception.
The interview did have some other moments where Putin put Kelly on the spot. At one point she was rambling, and he came back by asking her if she (and the rest of the media) “have anything better to do.” Kelly fumbled her words, knowing in her heart that he was correct.
It is ABOUT TIME that the media gets called out on their nonsense. We don’t have time for their lies anymore! If you hear someone spreading “fake news,” remember, put them in their place with FACTS. Liberals hate facts.",1

"2015 has been a year full of new social media initiatives for BBC News and Current Affairs.
We've expanded our activity on chat apps, experimented with a number of live-streaming services and short-form video formats and won a host of awards for our efforts.
Our digital current affairs team used Snapchat to explore new ways of reaching a millennial audience through digital story-telling around the migrant crisis for BBC Panorama.
The same programme also launched a new digital-first, social media project to reach and engage a broad audience online and on social media, including those communities affected by the closure of steelworks in Redcar over 50 days in the countdown to Christmas.
BBC Pop Up started the year in a desert and ended near the Arctic. Somewhere between those two points, the video journalism team hosted town meetings in Africa and across North America. They experimented with Facebook live streams in the Northwest Territories, posing questions from across the world to residents in real-time. They also took questions from Twitter into African slums in Kenya and crowdsourced dozens of story ideas from East African residents. With the help of social media, they uncovered Vatican scientists searching for alien life in Arizona and forged a new partnership with the messaging app Yik Yak during the Canadian elections.
Elsewhere, BBC News has looked to make the most of the growth in use of chat apps, as referenced by my colleague Trushar Barot in a recent report for the Tow Center.  The BBC has used messaging technologies to reach audiences in hard-to-reach parts of the world. BBC Persian launched a new service on the anonymous chat app, Telegram. The app is widely used by many Iranians and within a month of launch it had 200,000 subscribers, with some items posted reaching more than 800,000 unique users inside the platform.
We've also witnessed an exponential increase in eyewitness contributions to news events through WhatsApp over the year and launched a ""lifeline service"" on Viber to reach people with news and information during the Nepal earthquake.
Earlier in the year we took the decision to rationalise our presence on Facebook and to create a single page for BBC News on the platform.  The page has looked to highlight the most newsworthy and shareable stories for fans on Facebook and has already proven its ability to engage millions:
On Instagram, we launched new pop-up channels for the UK General Election:
And the BBC News Channel surpassed a million subscribers, with a number of new short-form video formats.
This year's #100Women season produced an array of engaging content and held debates that trended on social media in Nigeria, Nepal, Kabul and London at different times.
From Meerkat during the Ferguson protests to Periscope during the recent Paris attacks and most recently on Facebook Mentions, live-streaming on social media has clearly been one of the big talking points of the year. BBC reporters and correspondents were quick to experiment in this arena - most noticeably around breaking and developing news and for behind-the-scenes expert analysis.
Our social media innovation has been noticed in a favourable light over the course or the last year. A ""lifeline"" Ebola service we launched through WhatsApp won a George Foster Peabody Award for public service and a Knight Award for public service at the Online News Association Conference. BBC Trending and BBC News won social media Webby awards and @BBCBreaking won an Online Media Award for a second year running.

"PHOENIX — U. S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton canceled former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s upcoming sentencing hearing for his criminal contempt-of-court conviction, telling attorneys not to file replies to motions that were pending before Arpaio’s recent presidential pardon.
However, Bolton on Tuesday stopped short of throwing out the conviction based solely on Arpaio’s request. Instead she ordered Arpaio and the U. S. Department of Justice, which is prosecuting the case, to file briefs on why she should or shouldn’t grant Arpaio’s request.
Arpaio’s attorneys asked Bolton on Monday to vacate Arpaio’s conviction in light of President Trump’s Friday pardon.
Bolton has scheduled oral arguments on the matter for Oct. 4, the day before Arpaio was supposed to be sentenced.
There is case law that says a pardon implies an admission of guilt, and that will have to be argued in open court.
Mark Goldman, one of Arpaio’s attorneys, said, “We look forward to the hearing, and hope that the court will make the appropriate ruling. The verdict should have been set aside by the court already and prior to the pardon for the reason that it was never delivered to Sheriff Arpaio in open court, but instead sent to his attorneys via email, thus violating his constitutional rights to a public trial and to participate in his trial.”
Goldman told The Arizona Republic Arpaio will appeal if the judge does not vacate all decisions in the case.
“We don’t know if the court will,” he said. “And if they don’t, we’ll be appealing, but hopefully this will just put this to rest.”
Goldman said Arpaio spent the weekend fielding calls from reporters and supporters, and watching how news of his pardon was playing out on local and national news, including the Sunday morning political shows. Goldman said several media outlets have inaccurately reported that Arpaio was convicted of racially profiling Latinos during his immigration operations.
The underlying claims were in a civil lawsuit pursued by the American Civil Liberties Union, alleging racial profiling. Arpaio and his office lost. The allegation of criminal contempt came from a judge, not the U. S. Department of Justice, though the judge asked Justice to prosecute it.
“He was extremely distressed with the mischaracterization of the conviction,” Goldman said. “It was extremely hurtful and upsetting to him that it was being reported that he was convicted of racial profiling.”
“The sheriff is not a racist and has never been a racist, and any type of such accusation was upsetting and extremely distressing to him,” Goldman said.
But judging from letters to the editor, social-media posts and the press releases of activist groups, no one has changed sides in their support or opposition to the controversial former sheriff because of the pardon. If anything, it has only raised the volume of their voices.
“No matter how he tries to cover up the words, racial profiling was the underlying cause in both the civil and criminal charges,” said Mary Rose Wilcox, a Latino-rights activist and former longtime county supervisor.
Kim Nalder, professor of political science at California State University-Sacramento, said misreporting by the media of Arpaio’s conviction threatens to deepen mistrust of the media.
“It’s key that the details be very particular,” she said. “In this case, there may be a blurring of the lines between ‘contempt of court’ and ‘convicted for racist conduct.’ ”
Nalder said the press must be accurate or else “people who are already dismissive of the coverage … could consider the media ‘fake news,’ ” a popular Trump label of the media.
Wilcox was targeted in an investigation by Arpaio and former Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas, though criminal charges against her were thrown out in court as politically motivated. The county paid her $975,000 in a resultant civil suit she filed.
In the years they served together at the county, Wilcox told The Republic, she didn’t think of Arpaio as racist until he linked with Thomas, who championed state enforcement against illegal immigration.
“He jumped on the bandwagon and became the biggest racist in America because of the publicity he sought,” she said. “Whether he’s a racist at heart or not, nobody would ever know from the policies. They are racist to the core.”
During a press conference Monday, Trump spoke in defense of the pardon, telling reporters that Arpaio was treated “unbelievably unfairly.”
“He’s done a great job for the people of Arizona, he’s very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration, he is loved in Arizona,” Trump said. “I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him, right before the election voting started.”
In fact, the order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt did not come from Barack Obama’s administration, as is frequently reported. The racial profiling lawsuit was brought in civil court by the American Civil Liberties Union. The judge trying that case not only found that Arpaio’s policies constituted racial profiling, he also found Arpaio to be in civil contempt of court and referred him to another judge for the criminal contempt.
That judge, Susan Bolton, first asked the U. S. Attorney in Arizona to try the case. When that office declined, she asked the Department of Justice to take it.",1
"While Melania Trump is busy as First Lady, she always makes time in her day and on her travels to visit children around the world and in the United States who need a friend. Her compassion for sick kids or those afflicted with other insurmountable challenges in life is comparable to that of late Princess Diana of Wales.
It’s not her platform as First Lady, it’s simply who she is and the heart she has for those who need extra love. However, when she recentlydropped in for a surprise visit on a group of young girls who had escaped horrible situations, she was brutally attacked for a sick reason.
The saying that no good deed goes unpunished has never been more true than it has with our first lady who is perpetually ridiculed for everything positive she does. Since there’s nothing they can slam about this incredible woman, they either create something or make a mountain out the most innocuous offence. This is true about what Melania was brutally attacked for while visiting young girls at HomeSafe in Lake Worth, Florida, who finally have an incredible First Lady who they can look up to and be encouraged by. Unfortunately, the liberal media had to turn her surprise visit into something entirely different when they found something else to focus on.
“The first lady gave a motivational speech to a group of young girls between the ages of 12 and 17, and presented them with Easter baskets and stuffed bunnies, according to Footwear News. ‘I’m here to support you and help you,’ she said. ‘I want to encourage you, and do whatever I can to help you achieve your dreams’.”
“’This is a day that the girls will never forget’,” Matthew Ladika, the chief executive officer of HomeSafe, told the Palm Beach Post.”
“It was extra special and touching … She asked them what their interests are,” Ladika added.
The touching visit and attention she gave the girls wasn’t all the media saw. Melania took her thoughts about the visit to Twitter afterwards to say how proud she was of these girls and excited for what the future has for them because of who they are and what they’ve overcome. While she was speaking positive things into these girls’ lives that they definitely needed to hear, especially from someone as influential as the First Lady of the United States, the media was focused on what was on Melania’s feet.
There was so much incredible goodthat outlets could have focused on by covering this surprise event in the first place, which wasn’t Melania’s intent in showing up there. However, Footwear News, which if you follow any news outlet of substance, this one is probably not on your radar as it wasn’t on ours, could only discuss her footwear of choice that day being a departure from the shoes she typically wears.
Sure, Melania has impeccable style and to put something different on her feet than she normally does shouldn’t be a point of criticism or concern. However, her heart and compassion are much larger than her fashion.
“Some social media users were upset with Footwear News mentioning Melania’s footwear,” Opposing Views reported. “The website noted that the first lady took a break from her go-to Christian Louboutin pumps and wore a pair of Rene Caovilla sandals. The shoes retail for $1,150 on Nordstrom.com.”
“OK People: I did not vote for her husband. However, the lady showed up with Easter Baskets for the children,” one commenter wrote, proving that the site’s readers were rightfully not receptive to Footwear News’ stance on this compassionate trip. “That is a good thing Why did you need to keep going on about her shoes? That is mean.”
“Are you people so full of hate that you have to nitpick about everything they do?” another wrote in the comments, sharing the same shocked sentiment as the others. “At least she is trying to bring some happiness to some kids who have nothing… get over yourselves and appreciate that she is there…”
Even readers who were not fans of the Trumps for whatever reasoncould see the immaturity in this ridiculous blow to our first lady. The left’s tactics of attacking anything and everything this family does is not even lost on those they hope to appeal to. It’s just become ridiculous at this point that even when there’s nothing bad to say about something beautiful and caring she did for kids, they will go after this woman’s choice in footwear that she walked in wearing to help children who the supposedly “bleeding heart” liberals forgot.",1

This shooting went unreported because it did not fit the media narrative of racist white people killing black people.
It was a black refugee that killed a white woman and mother of two and wounding six other people.
This past weekend a mass shooting occurred at a church in Tennessee. Why haven’t you heard about it? Probably due to the facts surrounding the case which includes: a Sudanese immigrant, a black man, murdering a white mother of two and wounding six others.
The media opted to cover the NFL protests instead.
The shooter, Emanuel Kidega Samson of Sudan, murdered Melanie Smith in the parking lot. After killing the 39yr-old mother, Samson entered theBurnette Chapel Church of Christ and proceeded to shoot.
An usher in the church, 22yr-old Caleb Engle, was able to stop Samson after he accidentally shot himself. The usher was able to get his gun from his car and stand guard over the shooter until authorities showed up.
Plenty of issues to comment on there, but lets focus on why the media sucks, right now.
Maybe you read about this story on page 14 of the newspaper. I’m not exaggerating, either.The New York Timesput this mass shooting on page 14. The front page was dominated by athletes kneeling. Or perhaps you heard it mentioned in a 12-second blurb at the end of a cable newscast last night. I flipped through a few different channels and didn’t hear it even mentioned one time, but maybe they got around to it. Of course, in a 60-minute broadcast they had to allot at least 59 minutes to cataloging the posture of NFL players. If you managed to sit through all of that, you may have heard the “P. S. There was a mass shooting at a church today okay that’s all goodnight” at the end.",1

Moments after Vester Lee Flanagan II was fired from a television news station in Roanoke, he exploded into so much rage that frightened co-workers locked themselves in an office and a manager called police to forcefully remove him. As he was escorted out, Flanagan, 41, a reporter known to viewers as Bryce Williams, gave a small wooden cross to his boss and said, “You’ll need this,” according to a witness’s account of his February 2013 firing in response to a lawsuit he filed alleging wrongful termination. Flanagan’s contentious 10-month reporting stint at Southwestern Virginia’s CBS affiliate, WDBJ (Channel 7), ended in much the same way several jobs had since 2000: with a trail of colleagues with whom he did not get along, poor job-performance evaluations citing his volatile behavior and at least two lawsuits alleging racial discrimination and unfair treatment.  [A look at the Virginia shooter’s suicide memo]  On Wednesday morning, Flanagan shot and killed two of the station’s journalists, Alison Parker, a 24-year-old reporter, and Adam Ward, a 27-year-old cameraman, and wounded Vicki Gardner, head of the Smith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce, during a live broadcast, police said. Flanagan later killed himself while being chased by police, authorities said.                   The day of the shooting                                        The suspect in the attack then shot himself on I-66.       Mourners pay tribute to journalists Alison Parker and Adam Ward, who were fatally shot during a live broadcast the day before.   WDBJ7 news morning anchor Kimberly McBroom gets a hug from visiting anchor Steve Grant as meteorologist Leo Hirsbrunner reflects after their early morning newscast at the station in Roanoke.   Buy Photo              Ward had been at the station when Flanagan was fired and aimed a camera at him as he flipped off the newsroom during his forced exit. The station manager, Jeff Marks, said Parker was an intern when Flanagan worked at the station. He could not recall a specific run-in with her but said, “He had conflicts with so many people here, I don’t remember all the specific ones.” Marks said Flanagan, who authorities say posted a video online that he took of the shooting, was “a man with a lot of anger.” He added: “It came out in his relationships. He had trouble working with fellow employees and he had a short fuse.” Marks denied the lawsuit’s allegations of racial animus. In the suit, which was dismissed in 2014, Flanagan professed to have photos of a watermelon that he said appeared during a meeting with photographers. “The watermelon would appear, then disappear, then appear and disappear again, only to appear yet again,” he wrote. He urged the judge to pick a jury of his peers — which he defined as African American women. A precise motive for the killings remained elusive Wednesday, although Flanagan apparently offered a broad spectrum of grievances in a 22-page suicide note that ABC News said it received by fax two hours after the shooting. The document reads more like a rant, contradictory and paradoxical, extolling mass killers, blaming his father for not being there after he was fired from a job in Florida on one page but praising him for his support on another. It expresses hatred for black males and white females whom he said he was “attacked by” but claims that the nine African Americans killed in the Charleston church shooting was his breaking point, writing that he put a deposit on a gun two days after the massacre. “What sent me over the top was the church shooting,” says the suicide note, a full version of which was obtained by The Washington Post. “And my hollow point bullets have the victims’ initials on them.” It was not clear whose initials he was referring to. While also complaining that he was “shunned” for being gay, Flanagan lauds Virginia Tech mass killer Seung Hui Cho and expresses admiration for the Columbine High School killers. “Cho was brilliant and smooth,” the note reads. A cousin confirmed that Flanagan was gay. Flanagan also said his firing from Roanoke caused “an awful chain of events,” including the death of his two cats that appears to have occurred at his hands. “I drove to the forest ... and helped them exit. I’ll spare the details.” Flanagan grew up in East Oakland and graduated in 1995 from San Francisco State University. Roxane Barker, 54, lived across the street, and like others, she called him “Little Vester.” She said the Flanagans were the third black family to move into the mostly white neighborhood. “It was not easy,” she recalled. “Racism was very prevalent while he was growing up.” Barker said Vester Flanagan Sr. at one point was a dean at San Francisco State University. His wife, Betty, was a schoolteacher, according to an online obituary.  Said Baker: “We are in complete disbelief. He was a high achiever, goal-oriented, kind and gentle person. That’s who I know. I don’t know what transpired in his life in his later years.” On Wednesday night, the family of Vester Flanagan Sr. sent a statement to San Francisco-area TV station KRON, which was addressed to “Dear News WDBJ7.” “It is with heavy hearts and deep sadness that we express our deepest condolences to the families” of Parker and Ward, said the statement, which also offered prayers for Gardner’s recovery. “Words cannot express the hurt that we feel for the victims.” Flanagan’s first job was as an intern at KPIX in San Francisco for five months in 1993. “He was just a young, eager kid out of journalism school and like so many other interns and new employees who came through there in my 30 years at KPIX,” Barbara Rodgers, a 30-year veteran of the CBS-5 Eyewitness News station, posted on Facebook. Dawn Baker, who anchors the newscast at WTOC in Savannah, Ga., said she remembers Flanagan as a nice, if goofy and at-times aloof reporter during his two years with the station in the late 1990s. But even then, she said, he had a habit of bucking his bosses while practicing questionable journalism. During his time in Savannah, Flanagan used his legal name professionally, but Baker said eventually his colleagues found out he was using the name “Bryce Williams” socially. “He held up his hands and said ‘Bryce Williams,’ and made this motion like he was seeing it in lights: ‘That sounds so Hollywood,’” Baker said. But despite his oddities, Baker said that Flanagan was one of two colleagues who checked in on her daily after one of her cousins fell into a coma and that he later circulated a card and brought her a condolence plant. “It’s so difficult to wrap my mind around the fact that someone who could have been so compassionate and caring could do something that’s so unexplainable,” Baker said. It appears that Flanagan’s problems began at WTWC in Tallahassee, Fla., in 1999. He worked there 13 months, and he alleged in a lawsuit that he filed after he was fired that a producer had called him a “monkey” and said that “blacks are lazy.” He also alleged that employees made racial comments about a black murder suspect, which he said was evidence of discriminatory behavior. The station denied the allegations and said he never reported any racist behavior. Managers said in response to the suit, which the station settled, that Flanagan was fired for poor performance, misbehavior toward colleagues and the use of profanity. Don Shafer, news director at XETV in San Diego, said on the air Wednesday that he had hired Flanagan at WTWC and later fired him for chronic “bizarre behavior.” “We brought him in, he was a good on-air performer, a pretty good reporter,” he told viewers, “and then things started getting a little strange with him.” Mark Berman, J.

Today, the National Press Foundation has announced Nicole Carroll, Vice President/News and Editor of The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com, has won the prestigiousBenjamin C. Bradlee Editor of the Year Award.
Carroll, who has been with the Republic since 1999, most recently led the NETWORK’s groundbreaking project, ‘The Wall,’ which combined exceptional news reporting and emerging technologies to document the impact of the proposed border wall between the United States and Mexico. In her current role, Carroll oversees Arizona’s largest news team. In the past five years, the Republic/azcentral.com has twice been named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News (2012, 2014). Carroll also is the Southwest Regional Editor for the USA TODAY Network, overseeing newsrooms in New Mexico and Utah.
“We are so delighted and so proud for this recognition of Nicole’s great work and impact as a journalist and newsroom leader,” said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, SVP and Chief Transformation Officer, Gannett. “Nicole is a passionate advocate for her community and as such is driven to push the boundaries of storytelling, leveraging new tools and platforms to ensure the important work we do connects and resonates with the audiences we serve, while delivering on the highest standards of our craft.”
The National Press Foundation established the Editor of the Year Award in 1984 to “recognize significant achievements that enhance the quality of journalism in the United States. It recognizes imagination, professional skill, ethics and an ability to motivate staff — qualities that produce excellence in media and represent the highest standards of journalism.""
The National Press Foundation judges described Carroll as embodying “the spirit and courage that defined the legendary Benjamin C. Bradlee…Carroll knows her community intimately. When death threats arose after the Republic’s editorial board endorsed a Democrat for president, Carroll herself went to a Trump rally to brave the harassment hurled at her staff. She channeled the “Build the wall” chants into exemplary multi-platform journalism – “The Wall: Unknown Stories, Unintended Consequences”-- which mapped every mile of the U. S.-Mexico border and educated readers about the issues and challenges of a wall.”
The NETWORK was uniquely qualified to tackle such a substantial and critical project like this because of its local footprint, with boots on the ground all along the border and access to the voices and stories that need to be heard. The reporters didn’t just drop in on the story from the outside, they have covered this story, these issues and the people for decades. More than 30 reporters, editors, and photographers based in properties along the border came together under Carroll’s direction to provide this groundbreaking snapshot of life on the wall.
Carroll will receive her award at the annual NPF awards dinner on February 15, 2018 in Washington, D.C.Share your feedback to help improve our site experience!",0
"Nancy Pelosi has been in the news a lot lately and none of it for good reason. She recently held a Town Hall with CNN andwas humiliated by a Texas Rancher, told an adopted woman that her mother Should’ve Had The Choice To ABORT You, microphone incidents, hot mic incidents and so much more. So it comes as no surprise that Trey Gowdy has a VERY LOW opinion of her.
This video was from a couple of years ago but it is a relevant today as it was then.
Trey Gowdy (R) is not one for mincing words. He pretty much says what he thinks, which is why he got elected and which is why he has gained even greater respect in pursuing the scandals of the Obama administration. Appearing with Greta van Susteren on Fox News’ On the Record, Gowdy said in response to being asked about Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) comments about the vote for contempt of Attorney General Eric Holder were “mind numbingly stupid.”
You have to say that Nancy Pelosi was“mind numbingly stupid.” then and she is“mind numbingly stupid.”now!",1

Well, I don't agree. Even if I knew nothing about climate change the overwhelming weight of the majority of world scientists findings is staggering. Literally this is an issue that has brought together every nation regardless of politics or alliances. Never before in history has this happened. This has nothing to do with wealth redistribution although if redistribution of opportunity occurs from such a multinational endevour I would consider that a positive thing.
Grinding relentless poverty has shown itself to be a dangerously destabilizing factor in political and social disintegration and history is full of glaring examples.
Finally a President who has the balls...????
Sorry..again I disagree. If Mr Trump spent half as much time being proactive and smart as he does whining and crying about his victimization by the big nasty media, he might make some headway. Now if Gen. Mattis were Prez...
That man has giant balls and is as smart as a whip, his boss... not so much.

The US could fund green projects through various US based NGO's, fund university research into alternative energy with a view to field testing in developing Nations, provide tax credits to US corporations that invest in developing countries energy infrastructure and a great many other efforts - all of which helps the American economy and people - while helping other countries too. That's a win-win for America.

""Oil giants ExxonMobil xom and ConocoPhillips cop were among companies that reiterated their support for the accord ahead of Trump’s announcement, reports Bloomberg.
“Energy needs are a function of population and living standards,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods said at the company’s annual investor meeting in Dallas Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. Woods’ position in favor of staying in the deal is the same as his predecessor, current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
“When it comes to policy, the goal should be to reduce emissions at the lowest cost to society,” Woods said, adding that demand for oil will keep growing even with the climate deal in place.
ConocoPhillips thinks that being part of the Paris Agreement allows the U.S. to continue having a role in shaping efforts to reduce carbon emissions. “It gives the U.S. the ability to participate in future climate discussions to safeguard its economic and environmental best interests,” company spokesman Daren Beaudo told Bloomberg in an email.""

"US Marine Iraq Veteran Asks PROFOUND QUESTION About Muslim Immigrants: If they would kill me for being an American over there…why would they do differently over here?
They are NOT our friends.
Violent jihad dominates the attention of those responsible for national security. But the more dangerous long-term threat, the Center for Security Policy’s Team B report found, is what the Muslim Brotherhood calls “civilization jihad.”
This initial, pre-violentform of jihad, according to the totalitarian ideology of sharia, is considered an integral, even dominant element of jihad.
Moderate Muslims (which do not exist)provide the proverbial sea in which the jihadis swim. By offering little meaningful opposition to the jihadist agenda, a large number of Muslim communities and nations generally project a tacit agreement with jihadis’ ends, if not with their means.
Under shariah, civilization jihad – a “pre-violent” form of jihad – is considered an integral, even dominant element of jihad that is at least as obligatory for shariah’s adherents as the violent kind.
Such tactics are ostensibly “non-violent” (and therefore “moderate”) not because the Muslim Brotherhood eschews violence out of principle, but because it has decided that this phase of battlefield preparation is better accomplished through stealthy means. Hence civilization jihad can be considered “stealth jihad.”
Civilization jihad is a form of political and psychological warfare that includes multi-layered cultural subversion, the co-opting of senior leaders, influence operations, propaganda and other means of insinuating shariah gradually into Western societies.
The violence is always implicit in the overall strategy (such as that idea that we must proceed with the Ground Zero mosque, lest our opposition incite Muslim violence), albeit held in reserve for the final stages of the offensive. It is the combined effect of the violent and pre-violent strains of jihad that constitutes the most serious threat to the US and its free people.
The fact that liberals find the need to keep shouting that Islam is the “religion of peace” already tells you that something is off.
If it truly were the religion of peace, there’d be no need to keep telling people so.
Instead of trying to redefine Islam in ways that even top Muslims clerics aren’t, why don’t we listen to Americans who have actual experience in the heartland of Islam – the Middle East?
Over there, Muslims who don’t need to worry about hiding anything from host nations in the West are spilling the beans about the true intentions of their faith’s fundamentalists.

"We have heard NOTHING but talk about how Trump and Putin are in bed together. Recent undercover videos show that this is all a hoax, but the truth is now coming to light about the DEMOCRATS and RUSSIA!
It recently came to light that DEMOCRAT Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) used money from a PRIVATE FOUNDATION to pay for dinner for everyone at the home of the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, The Washington Free Beacon reports. While all this was happening the Senator kept quiet, and just this month everything came to light.
Ironically, McCaskill told The Washington Post she NEVER had a call or meeting with the Russian ambassador, though there was evidence that BOTH occurred, even before this story broke.
Even CNN said McCaskill went to a reception at Kislyak’s home in November 2015! So obviously she was lying. There MUST be a motive. We think we know what is going on here.
Democrats have been trying SO hard to pigeonhole Trump and everyone else in his cabinet as being tied to Russia in some way or another. In a sloppy attempt to cover up what their Party was doing, they just failed to report on it for longer than a couple of minutes.
THINK about it. If 12 hours of their time goes to show that Trump is working with Russia, and three and a half minutes go toward a story where a Dem met with the SAME PERSON, which one looks worse?The dinner payment was made clear as day, for the amount of $873. The payment was made through the Shepard Family Foundation, not McCaskill directly. It is disturbing that this did not get prior coverage.
Let’s be honest, the only “cooperation” going on in this meeting wasn’t what they were going to eat for dinner. McCaskill and her husband, Joseph Shepard, created the foundation in 2013, which as you imagine, takes donations.
The couple did not disclose their filings to the Senate Ethics Committee until earlier this month. How many other events did they sponsor with the Russian ambassador that we don’t know about yet?
There is more information that has yet to be uncovered. This is treason in the making — no question about it. It is time that the Democrats get off the FAKE NEWS crap and start talking about what THEIR Party is doing! The Patriots of this country are tired of the lies and deception. WE DESERVE THE TRUTH.",1

"The militant court carried out the sentence using the gruesome execution method of burning alive the convicts into ashes within an iron cage.
The militants claim to represent Islam belonging to 1.6 billion Muslims around the world while releasing macabre imagesof human suffering and death.
“The ISIL’s religious court ordered five residents of a village in Tal Abta region in Nineveh province to be burnt alive on spying charges and also for cooperating with the Iraqi security forces,” the Sumeria News quoted an unnamed local source as saying on Saturday.
The source also said that the victims were placed in iron cages and burnt into ashes.
Tal Abta region is located in the Nineveh province and 40 kilometers to the Southwest of the center of the province.
In a relevant development in early June, the ISIL Takfiri terrorists executed 19 Ezadi girls by burning them to death in Mosul, activists and eyewitnesses said.
The victims, who had been taken by the ISIL as sex slaves, were placed in iron cages in central Mosul and burned to death in front of hundreds of people, ARA news reported.
“They were punished for refusing to have sex with ISIL militants,” local media activist Abdullah al-Malla told the agency.
“The 19 girls were burned to death, while hundreds of people were watching. Nobody could do anything to save them from the brutal punishment,” an eyewitness said.
In August 2014, the ISIL radicals took over the Ezadi region of Shingle in Northern Iraq, causing a mass displacement of nearly 400,000 people to Duhok and Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan. Tens of thousands of Ezadis remained trapped in Mount Sinjar, suffering mass killings, kidnappings and rape cases, according to local and military sources. Also, more than 3,000 Ezadi girls have been taken by the radical group as sex slaves.",1
"The highly paid journalists at NBC and MSNBC who keep blasting President Trump’s tax reforms won’t have to wait for their rates to go down to benefit, since parent company Comcast likes the plan so much it is sending out $1,000 checks to employees.
Comcast announced on Thursday that it would award special $1,000 bonuses to over one hundred thousand employees because of the passage of tax reform and the FCC's action on broadband.
The cable company’s generosity presumablyextends toseven- and eight-figure stars, who have been railing nonstop against the landmark GOP reform as benefiting the rich at the expense of the poor.
Officials at NBC News and MSNBC declined to say if news stars like Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O’Donnell and Chris Matthews would try to make it up to tax policy “victims” by redistributing their $1,000 windfalls.
So, will the anti-Trump newsers pocket the cash?
“The tax bill does, indeed, raise some dilemmas for the MSNBC commentators, now that the newly passed tax bill will directly benefit their wallets. But I say they should go ahead and take the Comcast cash and then donate it to a charity that can help low income workers. That provides some degree of moral consistency for the MSNBC on-air talent who condemned the tax plan as a giveaway to the rich, an economic class that would surely include most of them,” media critic Jeffrey McCall told Fox News.
“That’s a lot of money,” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough said on “Morning Joe” Friday morning when discussing the bonuses that several companies are handing out.
The tax bill has been regularly attacked on MSNBC’s top programs, including “Morning Joe,” “The Rachel Maddow Show” and “The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell.” When discussing the tax bill, “Today” star Savannah Guthrie recently asked Paul Ryan, “Are you living in a fantasy world?” MSNBChosts Joy Reid and Katy Tur have also criticized the bill and essentially everyone else at the liberal network have mocked the bill in some capacity.
Fox News host Laura Ingraham tweeted that “every panelist and host on MSNBC better” give the money to charity but not everyone thinks that will actually happen.
“Trump's critics on MSNBC will, of course, keep the $1,000 bonuses since Comcast's generosity has a significant tax benefit to the company and represents a corporate 'thank you' for eliminating net neutrality,” journalist-turned-investment banker Poter Bibb told Fox News.
The $1.5 trillion tax bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percentand changes the way the U. S. government taxes companies that also operate internationally.
Most on-air talent collect hefty paychecks from Comcast, but McCall pointed out that anti-Trump pundits don’t have to take advantage of the tax reform if they’re against it.
“A bigger quandary might be whether these personalities will take any benefits fromthe new,lower income tax rates.Those decisions will be made in private, I presume, but there's nothing to stop people from continuing to pay at the higher level, if their moral compasses suggest they should be paying a higher share of their income to the feds,” McCall said.
Other companies including AT&T, Boeing, Wells Fargo and Fifth Third Bancorp are giving similar bonuses.

I see awesome chance to help Formula One proceed to create and flourish for the advantage of the game, fans, groups and financial specialists alike.”
Another administrator said: “I want to welcome Liberty Media to Formula One and I anticipate working with them.” A senior gardening delegate from the Liberty Media said the gathering will apply its broad media skill to the game.

“We think our long haul point of view and aptitude with media and games resources will permit us to be great stewards of Formula One and advantage fans, groups and our shareholders. “We anticipate working intimately with the new team to bolster the following period of development for this tremendously prominent worldwide game.”
The arrangement starts with Liberty acquiring a 18.4 for every penny stake of Delta Topco, the guardian organization of F1, developing that to 100 for every penny once the gathering has fulfilled all states of the deal, which incorporates endorsement by world Motorsport representing body the FIA.

Kyle Courtney of Wellstar Groundwater Technologies has been in the business for the past 30 years. That’s a lot of evening news for one man’s eyes and ears. But now Courtney has had enough of all the ABC nonsense about Russians swinging the election in favor of Trump.
“ABC News was the only channel I watched as a child growing up in Texas but I think they have lost touch with America and forgotten the working man. They don’t represent our voice anymore. Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign was funded by the Clinton Foundation in close coordination with the media, and now we’re seeing them try to fix what they couldn’t fix during the election. They are doing everything they can, night after night, to create narratives and sway people’s direction to impeach Donald Trump. Our democracy is at stake when a major political party and the media are in bed together. I’m not asking anyone to boycott the Democratic party. I’m not in the brainwashing business, but the liberal media is.”
Any good conservative knows it was the millions of other good conservatives who elected Trump and not some alleged Russian hacker walled up in Siberia who somehow convinced them to vote for Trump.
ABC added insult to fake news injury in April when it abruptly canceled Tim Allen’s hugely popular sitcom “Last Man Standing.” ABC swears it wasn’t a political maneuver to appeal liberal haters of the show. Rather, it was a business decision.
But it was music to the ears of LMS viewers when CMT officials announced “preliminary talks” about reviving the show.

"As Houstonians battled to escape their flooded homes, the liberal media immediately began pushing a heartwarming piece about evacuees being graciously welcomed into local mosques. Despite leftists using this narrative to shame white Christians, it didn’t take long for the truth to surface about their Texas “heroes.”
As social media giants like Google censor search results and manipulate analytics to snuff out any outlets that are even mildly conservative or anti-jihad, they assist in the mainstream media’s push for rhetoric that paints Muslims in a positive light. When devout Muslims who quote befitting Quran verses to justify genocide or terror attacks, liberal elitists refute the fact that they are Muslims. When self-proclaimed moderates who appear Westernized illegitimately insist that Islam is peaceful, fluff articles gushing over their un-Islamic lifestyles deem them the epitome of Islamic fundamentals. So, when the media caught wind of a local Muslim congregation taking in Houston hurricane victims, they were there to shove the sappy story in the faces of Americans. Unfortunately, there was a major issue with their claims.
Countless mainstream media outlets have published at least one or multiple articles praising Houston-area “mosques opening their doors to hurricane Harvey victims.” What the left-leaning reporters conveniently omitted is that of the 200,000 Muslims in the greater-Houston metro area alone, they only assisted approximately 125 victims, many of whom are Muslim, despite over 100,000 affected homes, according to the Geller Report.
Disturbingly, the very few “mosques” the media claim have opened their doors to refugees are Islamic center gymnasiums and not sacred worship areas since non-Muslims, who are considered unclean by the Quran, are typically prohibited. Additionally, the Muslim evacuees who are staying at one of the convention centers have even reportedly been “blocking off a small prayer space with chairs and their shoes” to prevent non-Muslims from using certain areas.
Among other major outlets, USA Today purported that the Champions Islamic Center only ended up housing just 15 evacuees, although it’s unclear how many of them are also Muslims.
Expectedly, CNN and the New York Daily News fawned over Brand Lane Center, which is in Stafford, for hosting “about 80 to 90 people.” Of course, they didn’t report whether those individuals were mosque-goers, Muslims, or non-Muslim evacuees. In fact, the photo making its rounds isn’t even of the mosque but of the George R. Brown Convention Center, which would be easy for readers to mistake for an Islamic center. Oddly enough, Brand Lane Center, also called Masjid As-Sabireen, posted on August 28 that their mosque “is NOT a shelter or distribution center.”
Vox published perhaps the most propagandized puff piece, purposefully ignoring the countless Christian and Jewish organizations and houses of worship that rescued, sheltered, and donated in order to highlight “a number of mosques” opening their doors. Oddly, the “number of mosques” in Vox’s article boiled down to one Islamic center — the aforementioned Brand Lane Center, which only took in possibly 90 people.
Of course, there certainly are Muslims who buck the Quran’s commands to “be harsh to the unbelievers but merciful to each other” in order to offer kindness to non-Muslims. However, even the expected act of opening one’s place of worship to traumatized victims is widely prohibited by Islamic law. In fact, most mosques rarely allow non-Muslims entrance unless it’s in a grassroots attempt to convert or convince them that Islam is actually peaceful.
“…it is permissible if it serves the interests of sharee’ah or meet a valid need, such as a person hearing something that may invite him to enter Islam, or because he needs to drink water in the mosque, or the like. This is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) tied up (his prisoner) Thamaamah ibn Athaal al-Hanafi in the mosque before he became Muslim, and the delegations of Thaqeef and the Christians of Najraan stayed in the mosque before they became Muslim. There were many benefits offered by doing this: they could hear the speeches and sermons of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), see people praying and reciting Qur’aan, and other benefits that are gained by those who visit the mosque. (From Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 6/276).
“If some kuffaar ask to enter the mosque so that they can see how Muslims pray, so long as they have nothing with them that could make the mosque dirty, and there are no women among them who are dressed in a provocative fashion, or any other reason not to let them in, then there is nothing wrong with allowing them to enter and sit behind the Muslims so they can see how they pray. If we fear that there is someone who may rebuke them (for not praying etc.) without realizing that they are not Muslim, we should point this out to them.”
Geller explains that, as the mandate states, on the rare occasions in which non-Muslims are invited into mosques, they must not carry anything considered “dirty,” such as Christian or pagan symbols, un-Islamic texts, or other religious expressions. Of course, the mentality that non-Muslims are dirty creatures comes directly from the Quran and hadith, which not only portray unbelievers as subhumans but command their oppression and slaughter.
Quran (48:29) – “Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard (ruthless) against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves”
Quran (2:191-193) – “And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing…”
Quran (9:5) – “So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.”
The proof is in the halal pudding. We constantly see churches opening their doors to not only non-Christians but controversially welcoming in Muslims to pray to Allah, give sermons, deliver anti-Christian prayers declaring that Jesus is not God, and hosting Quran studies, yet it’s nearly impossible to find stories of Muslims welcoming in Christians to pray to Christ or Jews to recite from the Torah. This is solely because of the Quran’s consistent hatred toward non-Muslims, which the prophet Muhammad displayed in his enslavement, persecution, and mass killing of them.",1
"IN 1962 a British political scientist, Bernard Crick, published “In Defence of Politics”. He argued that the art of political horse-trading, far from being shabby, lets people of different beliefs live together in a peaceful, thriving society. In a liberal democracy, nobody gets exactly what he wants, but everyone broadly has the freedom to lead the life he chooses. However, without decent information, civility and conciliation, societies resolve their differences by resorting to coercion.
How Crick would have been dismayed by the falsehood and partisanship on display in this week’s Senate committee hearings in Washington. Not long ago social media held out the promise of a more enlightened politics, as accurate information and effortless communication helped good people drive out corruption, bigotry and lies. Yet Facebook acknowledged that before and after last year’s American election, between January 2015 and August this year, 146m users may have seen Russian misinformation on its platform. Google’s YouTube admitted to 1,108 Russian-linked videos and Twitter to 36,746 accounts. Far from bringing enlightenment, social media have been spreading poison.
Russia’s trouble-making is only the start. From South Africa to Spain, politics is getting uglier. Part of the reason is that, by spreading untruth and outrage, corroding voters’ judgment and aggravating partisanship, social media erode the conditions for the horse-trading that Crick thought fosters liberty.
A shorter attention spa...oh, look at that!
The use of social media does not cause division so much as amplify it. The financial crisis of 2007-08 stoked popular anger at a wealthy elite that had left everyone else behind. The culture wars have split voters by identity rather than class. Nor are social media alone in their power to polarise—just look at cable TV and talk radio. But, whereas Fox News is familiar, social-media platforms are new and still poorly understood. And, because of how they work, they wield extraordinary influence.
They make their money by putting photos, personal posts, news stories and ads in front of you. Because they can measure how you react, they know just how to get under your skin (see article). They collect data about you in order to have algorithms to determine what will catch your eye, in an “attention economy” that keeps users scrolling, clicking and sharing—again and again and again. Anyone setting out to shape opinion can produce dozens of ads, analyse them and see which is hardest to resist. The result is compelling: one study found that users in rich countries touch their phones 2,600 times a day.
It would be wonderful if such a system helped wisdom and truth rise to the surface. But, whatever Keats said, truth is not beauty so much as it is hard work—especially when you disagree with it. Everyone who has scrolled through Facebook knows how, instead of imparting wisdom, the system dishes out compulsive stuff that tends to reinforce people’s biases.
This aggravates the politics of contempt that took hold, in the United States at least, in the 1990s. Because different sides see different facts, they share no empirical basis for reaching a compromise. Because each side hears time and again that the other lot are good for nothing but lying, bad faith and slander, the system has even less room for empathy. Because people are sucked into a maelstrom of pettiness, scandal and outrage, they lose sight of what matters for the society they share.
This tends to discredit the compromises and subtleties of liberal democracy, and to boost the politicians who feed off conspiracy and nativism. Consider the probes into Russia’s election hack by Congress and the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, who has just issued his first indictments. After Russia attacked America, Americans ended up attacking each other (see article). Because the framers of the constitution wanted to hold back tyrants and mobs, social media aggravate Washington gridlock. In Hungary and Poland, without such constraints, they help sustain an illiberal, winner-takes-all style of democracy. In Myanmar, where Facebook is the main source of news for many, it has deepened the hatred of the Rohingya, victims of ethnic cleansing.
What is to be done? People will adapt, as they always do. A survey this week found that only 37% of Americans trust what they get from social media, half the share that trust printed newspapers and magazines. Yet in the time it takes to adapt, bad governments with bad politics could do a lot of harm.
Society has created devices, such as libel, and ownership laws, to rein in old media. Some are calling for social-media companies, like publishers, to be similarly accountable for what appears on their platforms; to be more transparent; and to be treated as monopolies that need breaking up. All these ideas have merit, but they come with trade-offs. When Facebook farms out items to independent outfits for fact-checking, the evidence that it moderates behaviour is mixed. Moreover, politics is not like other kinds of speech; it is dangerous to ask a handful of big firms to deem what is healthy for society. Congress wants transparency about who pays for political ads, but a lot of malign influence comes through people carelessly sharing barely credible news posts. Breaking up social-media giants might make sense in antitrust terms, but it would not help with political speech—indeed, by multiplying the number of platforms, it could make the industry harder to manage.
There are other remedies. The social-media companies should adjust their sites to make clearer if a post comes from a friend or a trusted source. They could accompany the sharing of posts with reminders of the harm from misinformation. Bots are often used to amplify political messages. Twitter could disallow the worst—or mark them as such. Most powerfully, they could adapt their algorithms to put clickbait lower down the feed. Because these changes cut against a business-model designed to monopolise attention, they may well have to be imposed by law or by a regulator.
Social media are being abused. But, with a will, society can harness them and revive that early dream of enlightenment. The stakes for liberal democracy could hardly be higher.",0
"Global warming is something you hear about constantly on the news. Some talk about how hot the days have been. Some talk about how natural disasters have risen in both number and intensity. Some talk about how the polar ice caps have been melting, and how the polar bears and penguins are dying. Every day on the news, someone brings this topic up. Forget everything you knew about climate change. When Hal Lewis, a top scientist and a large part of the American Physical Society, resigned in October of 2010 he addressed that global warming was a scam.
Lewis claimed that it was by far the longest con in the scientific community. He said that the driving force for this propaganda was the money. Literally billions of dollars are going into global warming research each year, and as the problem continues to “exist, ” the money will continue to be dumped into the project. He claims that it wasn’t always like this and that the APS used to be a quieter, more valuable group. He even goes on to claim that no man can call himself a scientist and believe in the scam that is global warming.
He chalked it up to a marketing stunt. There is no doubt that these scientists would not be getting this amount of money for other research. The reason the world is putting so much into this is because of the cost they think they will pay it they don’t. It is also clear that the media is making massive amounts of money off of this. Tragic stories always get more attention than happy ones. There certainly is a side of the story that does not quite add up to global warming. Many well-known and respected scientists have openly said the global warming is not real. Even Al-Gore’s presentation has been debunked.
Personally, I think the important thing to remember is that if we do nothing about global warming and it is real, we lose a planet. If we do this work and it is not real, we lose some money and still make the world a better place to live in. Food for thought.",1

"In the wake of the horrific hurricanes that have devastated our nation, we have truly witnessed the good, the bad, and the ugly.
In Texas and in Florida we have seen Americans coming together and helping each other in any way possible. Many helped by donating food, money, and first aid supplies to those in need.
Others went to the places that were affected the most and helped ferry people in boats. This is the type of behavior that most kind-hearted Americans would expect, neighbor helping neighbor, but this isn't always the case.
Many celebrities took advantage of the fatal tragedies by taking to the public forum and bashing Trump. Movie star Jennifer Lawrence even went as far as to say that Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey were Trump's fault as if he caused them somehow.
Even worse than that is the low-life scumbags chose to use this tragedy as an opportunity to steal from those that have lost everything.
Rampant looting has plagued just about every city affected by these two devastating hurricanes and due to the wreckage and flooding police have been unable to get into many areas and protect them from these thugs.
This means many homeowners are taking matters into their own hands, as is the case with this one Floridian family that put a brutal message on the front of their home for any would be looters.
The sign reads ""Don't even think about it. We're home and armed.""
Any thugs that try busting into this Florida home are going to get a whole lot more than he bargained for when they meet their 'gracious hosts,' a little southern hospitality from the end of a smoking barrel.
Not only is this Florida homeowner willing to do what it takes to keep his family and possessions safe, he's got a bit of comedic streak in him. The last part of the sign reads ""Irma Gerd"" which is a popular internet saying for ""Oh my god.""
Looters, you have been warned. 'Irma Gerd.'
Do you think these thugs deserve to suffer the consequences if they try to loot during these tragic times?",1
"Before your next trip to Italy, France, Africa or a local theme park, you need to pick a camera that suits all your needs. Where you are going makes a difference. If you are going to Hawaii or Bali, you may want to capture some underwater shots. You must remember, not all cameras are created equal. No “one-in-all” camera can address all your needs.
First, you need to assess your needs and then make a list of your priorities. It should look something like this –
* Why do I need the camera?
* Will I be taking some long distance shots or will I be taking underwater shots?
* Will I be clicking many pictures in low light conditions or high light conditions?
* What is my experience in photography?
* Finally, what is my budget?
Once you find the answer to these five questions, it will become a lot easier for you to find the right model, make and brand of camera for your upcoming holidays.
How to start your searching process?
Cameras are an investment. Especially, if you are thinking of buying a digital SLR or DSLR, you should consider the maintenance cost and accessories cost as well. Long exposure photos look amazing on DSLRs, but for that, you will need special lens assemblies and a good quality tripod. If you are thinking about Megapixel and clarity, remember not to confuse them. Megapixel is not everything. Unless you are thinking of officially competing at expert photography contests or printing out poster size images, you should not invest in an upper range megapixel model. Try to save the money for having some fun during the holiday.
What’s right for you?
Digital point and shoot cameras are much better in comparison to DSLRs for amateur photographers. They are smaller, niftier and you will find digital cameras much easier to manage. Cleaning a digital point-and-shoot is also much less of a hassle if you consider the entire lens assembly and disassembly ordeal of the standard DSLR cameras. Digital SLRs may be becoming cheaper by the day, but that does not mean you should go out and just get one on a whimsy.
Find out about the “extras.”
These extras can range from memory cards and camera cases to lenses, filters, tripods, and reflectors. The higher the model you choose (DSLRs), the more the cost of these extras become. Most retailers try to bundle on these extras with your purchase, so you end up paying for a bunch of things you do not need. If you think, you will not be comfortable lugging around a DSLR, do not go for one. Get a good quality digital camera. Digital cameras have far fewer add-ons as compared to SLRs and DSLRs. Just get a couple of extra memory cards to stay prepared for fun filled vacation.
Next thing to consider is your zooming level. While buying a camera, zoom is going to be the deciding factor in many cases. Zoom can refer to either digital zoom or optical zoom. Digital zoom simply makes your subject look bigger. It enlarges the pixel size, while not populating them more. This creates blurry images as we used to see in first generation mobile cameras. Optical zoom, on the other hand, offers better quality zoom images. The most popular options in the market come with optical zoom options. You will find a plethora of “super zoom” cameras in the market. Our advice – always go for one that states “Optical Zoom.” Even a 3x optical zoom is enough for holiday photography.
This is another huge concern for those shopping for cameras. Do you plan on making a lot of adjustments to ISOs, shutter speed, focus, and grids? If not, do not go for a high-end model that floods you with so many options. No one wants you to spend your time at the beach or in front of the Eiffel Tower with your face inside the manual. You must remember to keep the controls simple to capture the right moment with as little effort as possible. A simple camera will help you stay ready for any frame-worthy moment that pops up naturally.
When we are talking cameras, we cannot just skip selfies. For holiday selfies, you need a camera that is light and one that you can at least operate by yourself. The best way to choose a selfie camera is to try one at the store. You will see thousands of people post mirror selfies using DSLRs. That is one problem with these cameras. They are so massive; you cannot usually operate them with one hand. If you are more of a selfie person, you need a lighter digital camera that can capture you from all angles. You may even want to try your camera once on a selfie stick before you make your purchase. DSLRs and holiday selfies do not blend and trying to make them meet quite a futile effort.
What’s the word in the market?
Finally, you need to pay attention to what other users are saying about a camera. Some of the new models seem lucrative with their flush designs and candy colors. However, are they worthy of their price? Cameras can be quite a costly deal, and it is always better to find out what you are signing up for before you make your purchase. CNET, PC Mag, and a few more websites have genuine reviews about specific camera brands and models. Research both to find out the perfect balance between price and performance.
Shopping for a camera should be fun and celebratory. It is the official beginning of the preparation of a holiday you have long deserved. Just remember to list your needs, expectations, and budget before you walk into that store. Do not forget to look beyond buzzwords including zoom, megapixel, and DSLR. Keep your focus on the models that meet your need and do not cost you a buck more than your permissible budget.",1
"The mainstream media is trying to make the “Women’s” March against Trump look like a major success. They claims that millions of people were there and there was no violence, however, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Fox contributor Frank Luntz detailed what happened to him at the march.
First he sent out a tweet that said “Marriott Marquis lobby is full of drunk, angry protesters harassing paying customers. If you’re still in DC, avoid this area. #WomensMarch” However, later on in the say things got worse. He tweeted, “I got red paint thrown on me and called a “fascist MF’er” by a protester here. The @Marriott let it happen. Shame on them. #WomensMarch”
He went on to further explain this incident on Fox News.
“A woman walked up to me in the Marriott Marquis and she shouted, ‘you fascist,’ and then two other words that would get me fired from your network. And she threw this red confetti glitter right in my eyes and she picked up another handful and she no further than 6 inches away and I was covered with this stuff.”
“Since when do you have the right or ability to attack someone in a private setting? I never thought this would be America. I never thought this would happen in this country,” said Frank Luntz. Are these people going way too far?",1
"When their Anointed One lost the election, big television news networksand primary newspapers coinedthe term “fake news” because they were angry at alternative media for eroding deep into their domain. Itwas time to expose these fakers because audienceswere fleeing to alternatives to establishment media as certainly as they fled to alternatives to establishment politicians.
Without a doubt there is a ton of fake news on alternative media sites, which often publish what works for them without much fact checking. So, to launch awar on their competition, the mainstream mediaemployedtheir standardsound-byte strategy that hasworked well for them in the past. Theysimultaneously started circulating the new talking point“fake news” to try to stopthe migrationof audiences toward alternative news sites. It was time to point out how they, the mainstream media, do a superior job of editing out the baloney for you.
Everybodyelse’snews becamefake news, but the mainstream media’sown exaggerated and highly spun stories, which they ran day after day … that was justbedrock reality. The MSMdroppedeven the pretense of separating their own commentary from news stories, and muchof their news became commentary aboutalternative media; but the “fake news” mantra all backfired this time.",1
"It is a tragic moment when a soul becomes trapped into a daily routine. Day after day it is the same thing, and eventually, that person tunes out from the rest of the world. News no longer matters, social media is just something to stare at mindlessly, and the overall desire to learn and expand knowledge gradually fades away.
However, something is happening in this world. People are beginning to recognize what we have and take advantage of it. This has become evident through a series of realizations.
The first of these is that human beings are beginning to burn out. Long gone are the old days where the majority of people were content to sit in big corporate offices where it was the same thing over and over again. Now, everyone wants to break into entrepreneurship and escape from the drudgery that has always been part of this society.
Ironically however, even the old way of breaking in to the world of being an entrepreneur has changed.
In the past, the best way to become an entrepreneur was to get sponsored by an investor, which in the long run just made you an average employee once again. But thanks to our understanding of the internet and the freedom it brings us, human society has finally begun to find their own way into the business making world. Now more than ever, great companies are springing out of garages and home offices ready to make a change.
So many big alterations are taking place that we almost can’t keep up with all of them. This is where the new age idea of working with people, as opposed to in competition with them, has suddenly become more appealing. Gone are the days where it was a “man eat man” world; now people come together to work towards a change for the greater good.
The direction of sharing and collaborating is something that has taken this world by storm, and it is truly a remarkable feat. What this can do for mankind in general, is bring millions of people together for multiple great causes; making more differences than ever seen before.
Thanks to the internet, this collaboration change is actually possible. And not only that, but we now have the ability to collapse barriers and help people obtain a voice through being more informed about the world that we live in. In other countries, the big media bosses who used to control who got to see what, are no longer capable of that.
People now have greater access to whatever they desire to see and learn. Which is going to make a tremendous difference in our society. While there is still a struggle in some areas, the internet is slowly creeping its way into every corner of the world; and eventually, every single person and cause will be able to have a voice of their own, no matter how small they may be.
There is no end to the amount of knowledge mankind has access too with the internet.
We are better able to understand healthy and organic eating, which should be the basic fundamentals of the human society. But because we have been so lost in our fast food and convenience stores, we have forgotten the true importance such substances have for our bodies.
Through increased knowledge, hopefully the struggle of malnutrition and obesity all over the world will eventually be demolished. Even the spiritual awakening that has taken place through the understanding of yoga, meditation, and religions that have otherwise been inaccessible, are now available through the internet.
This amazing tool has constantly been taken for granted in the past; primarily because the older generation always lived well before it and the newer generation has never had to be without it.
The extraordinary event that is taking place, is that people are slowly waking up to the changes that this world is going through. Instead of living in a blurry routine, more and more realizations are occurring about what can be done with the tools we have access to today. While it may not have always been this way, the new world is definitely astonishing and we are lucky to be living in it.",1
"If you read the news or watch it on television or the Internet, you would think that most malls teeter on the edge of closing, with empty storefronts and Starbucks accounting for most storefronts. You would also think that consumers had abandoned brick-and-mortar shopping in favor of taking their business online.
In this bleak ""retail apocalypse,"" as the media has dubbed it, the Internet — specifically Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) — has decimated traditional retail. You might think, given that bleak narrative for physical retailers, that the rise of digital would lead to shrinking sales for traditional stores during the 2017 holiday season.
That seems right, but it's wrong. Digital sales are growing, and some brick-and-mortar chains have suffered, but holiday sales in physical stores will increase in 2017.
Online sales are expected to reach $107.4 billion during the 2017 holiday season, according to data from Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) Analytics. That's a 13.8% increase over 2016.Brick-and-mortar sales won't increase by quite as much, but they will still be up 10%.
The National Retail Federation expects total November and December sales (excluding automobiles, gasoline, and restaurants) to reach between $678.75 billion and $682 billion. That means that Americans still spend over $5 in stores for every $1 they spend online.
Digital is growing, but the dollars are there for brick-and-mortar chains. It's easy to blame failing stores and ailing malls on e-commerce led by Amazon, but that ignores some physical retailers that continue to grow, led by discounters such asDollar General,Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, andTJX, parent of Marshalls, TJ Maxx, and HomeGoods. Others, meanwhile, have managed to make omnichannel retailing work, including Target, Best Buy,andWalmart (NYSE: WMT).

""This year's record-breaking online holiday shopping season is built on the strength of the big players,"" said Adobe Insights Vice President Mickey in a press release. ""We predict the biggest retailers with wide selections, easy shopping experiences, and free shipping, to drive online holiday growth this year.""
That makes sense, given that a recent analysis of the prices of 52,000 items by Profitero, an e-commerce analytics company, showed that Amazon had the cheapest online prices, with Walmart only 2.9% behind. The big two in online retail dominate partly because of price, but also because they have created a smooth customer experience and offer reliable, predictablee delivery.
The reason the ""retail apocalypse"" narrative has emerged is that people see well-known stores closing or struggling. That has certainly happened, but as some chains struggle and even go out of business, others have emerged to take their place.
Clearly, retail has begun a major shakeout that's going to continue. Some companies won't survive, but retailers that give consumers a reason to leave their house will. That reason might be pricing, or it could be the experience of shopping in a certain store, but chains that figure out how to make their stores a destination will continue to thrive.

"The news Sunday afternoon that Steve Bannon had been named chief strategist in President-elect Donald Trump's White House sparked renewed interest in a topic NPR covered this summer, the rise of the white nationalist movement, also referred to euphemistically as the ""alt-right.""
Bannon is the former CEO of Breitbart News, an online news site that he previously called ""the platform for the alt-right.""
Happily, from my point of view, the language NPR used to describe Bannon and the movement evolved quickly away from just ""alt-right."" As standards editor Mark Memmott wrote Monday in an internal memo, ""additional words are needed because many in the audience either have not heard of it or aren't sure what it is.""
He laid it out in guidance to the staff:
The views of the alt-right are widely seen as anti-Semitic and white supremacist.   It is mostly an online movement that uses websites, chat boards, social media and memes to spread its message. (Remember the Star of David image that Trump received criticism for retweeting? That reportedly first appeared on an alt-right message board.)   Most of its members are young white men who see themselves first and foremost as champions of their own demographic. However, apart from their allegiance to their ""tribe,"" as they call it, their greatest points of unity lie in what they are against: multiculturalism, immigration, feminism and, above all, political correctness.   The AP says this: ""The so-called alt-right — a movement often associated with far-right efforts to preserve 'white identity,' oppose multiculturalism and defend 'Western values.' ""
His advice concluded: ""'White nationalist' is the most concise description,"" and the NPR newsroom seems to be following that directive.
In a series of subsequent interviews, NPR has explored exactly what the movement is (and it should be noted that Bannon gave a just-published interview rejecting some of these ideas.) Media correspondent David Folkenflik did a reported piece for All Things Considered, and a deeper online story, and discussed the topic on Here & Now. On Morning Edition, Steve Inskeep conducted what I found to be a contentious live interview with Joel Pollak, senior editor-at-large for Breitbart News (some found it not contentious enough). And on Thursday's All Things Considered, Kelly McEvers interviewed Richard Spencer, a white nationalist who coined the term ""alt-right,"" but the interview itself did not air live.
The Morning Edition and All Things Considered interviews, in particular, prompted several hundred complaints to NPR, most along the lines that NPR was ""normalizing"" hate speech.
Here are just a couple of the few more charitable ones that came to my office:
""I am deeply concerned and disturbed by Morning Edition's story about Breitbart News and Steve Bannon. The opening...""Let's hear a defense..."" was so offensive as was the tone of the entire story. There is no defense to bigotry. Bigotry is not an opinion or partisan. It's a form of hate.""
""I suspect you will get hundreds, if not thousands, of email messages concerning the segment ""'We're Not Going Away': Alt-Right Leader On Voice In Trump Administration"" piece that aired today. I certainly hope you are inundated. While I appreciate McEvers' careful, and repeated, acknowledgement of the fringe white supremacist (what she calls ""nationalist"") views expressed, I was appalled that NPR effectively legitimated such views by interviewing someone suspended from Twitter because of his hateful rhetoric and beliefs. While it is obvious that President-elect Trump's campaign has given such men a higher platform for their abhorrent and clearly dangerous views, I do not think NPR has to pander to them. Quote them if you must, report on their rise and organizing strategy and followers — but interview them as if they were any other figure of importance? That only entrenches their growing power further. This is beyond ""balance.""
""I am writing to express my concern about Kelly McEvers's interview of Richard Spencer on the Nov. 17, 2016 episode of All Things Considered.
I first want to say that I appreciate the program's attempts to contextualize the interview, but the interview itself seemed far too normalizing of hateful rhetoric. Both Richard Spencer and his ""think tank,"" the National Policy Institute have been profiled by the Southern Poverty Law Center. While Spencer's words themselves are pretty damning, not enough was done to emphasize that this is a recognized hate group.
This is also concerning in light of how Steve Inskeep approached the interview with Joel Pollak on the Nov. 16, 2016 episode of Morning Edition.
These two interviews together go a long way to normalizing white supremacist ideologies and normalizing hate speech. I'd like to see more pressing journalism that questions how recognized hate groups and extremists can have the ear of the President-Elect and a place in his administration.""
Those who write my office tend to be critics, although Eric Schwartz, of Williamsport, Md., wrote to us: ""I wanted to thank All Things Considered and Kelly McEvers for her interview with Richard Spencer on Nov. 17. It is essential that the people of the nation know more about the White Supremacists. Spencer's talk about racial homelands may be chilling, but the public should know about these views and the fact that these people were key supporters of Donald Trump. I urge NPR to continue to shine a light on an ideology that was so central to the candidacy of Mr. Trump. This ideology may play a critical role in shaping policy of the Trump administration.""
NPR also posted the Spencer interview on its Facebook page, and the reaction in the comments was much more positive. Wrote one person: ""I really appreciate All Things Considered covering this. Please do everything you can to report on who these people are and what this movement actually represents.""
More listener reactions aired on Friday's All Things Considered.
I asked the newsroom for a response to the outpouring of criticisms and got back a short statement from Michael Oreskes, NPR's top newsroom executive, which seemed to refer only to the praise: ""I'm glad that NPR listeners understand why it is so important that we bring these voices to attention. We cover the world as it is. It is our duty to present difficult and even unacceptable points of view if they are driving thinking among voters or policy makers. We work hard to set these voices in that context.""
Here's my take. NPR is not the only news organization to have conducted such interviews in recent days. The New York Times did, the Dallas News did and the non-NPR-affiliated public radio program Reveal did, to name a few.
There is a difference in the way the audience perceives written pieces and hearing them on the radio. Broadcast interviews come across as giving the interviewees, any interviewees, a ""platform"" to spread their ideas, to employ a term many of the critics of these interviews have used.
That makes framing such interviews all the more important. Unlike many of those who wrote to my office, I'm not going to dissect the two interviews question by question, but I will make a couple of points.
I think the framing of the Morning Edition interview was problematic, starting as it did with ""Let's hear a defense of Steve Bannon."" I don't believe NPR ran the interview for reasons of ""balance,"" but because, as Oreskes says, it's NPR's role as a news organization to bring to light and scrutinize even the most difficult currents of society. (I would give the same response to the handful of people who have written my office saying these interviews showed NPR's liberal bias, because they were contentious.) But when framed as a defense, listeners will not hear it as a probing interview.
In addition, in my opinion, these interviews should not be done live. Inskeep is an excellent live interviewer, but live interviews are difficult, especially when there is limited time. A little contextualizing never hurts. It worked for the Spencer interview, to my mind, and NPR also did the same this summer with Inskeep's interview with David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who was then running for U. S. Senate in Louisiana. The Duke interview drew similar criticisms, but I defended it, partly because I thought it was put into context well.
My broad takeaway? I know the many listeners who wrote will disagree, but I believe there should be no topic off limits for NPR, and that it is important to hear from people directly, so one can know exactly where they are coming from. But going forward, when tackling such deeply serious topics, NPR needs to pay absolute attention that the questions asked are rigorous, the headlines and framing well thought through and the language very clear and precise from the beginning.",0

"Think of it as half drone, half motorcycle: A new hoverbike prototype aims to make flying as simple as riding a bike.
Hoversurf, a Russian drone startup, recently unveiled its Scorpion-3 hoverbike in a test-flight video — making it the first manned quadcopter that has undergone testing, reported Futurism, a science and technology news website.
The Scorpion-3 combines quadcopter-drone technology with a traditional motorcycle design, resulting in an electric-powered hoverbike that can lift itself and a pilot into the air. According to Hoversurf's website, the hoverbike can be flown by both professionals and amateurs, because the bike's custom software allows for both manual and automated control.
""[The] Scorpion platform is the next step in accessible amateur flying developed to inspire athletes, engineers, scientists and inventors around the world,"" Hoversurf officials said on the company's website. ""[It] is equipped with a safety system powered by state of the art flight controllers, special logical programing and passive elements with computer aided speed and altitude limiting.""
While the Scorpion-3 could offer new mass transportation options, like Dubai's recently announced passenger drone, Hoversurf said it designed the hoverbike with extreme sports in mind. A compact dirt bike inspired the hoverbike's sport-utility frame, and the pilot's uniform (seen in the video and on the website) is reminiscent of a motocross driver. The company describes the hoverbike's ride as ""surfing through the air.""",0
"Say what you want about the state of our country right now, but when disaster strikes, Americans have not forgotten how to rally together.
Category 4 Hurricane Harvey battered half the state of Texas this weekend and brought plenty of destruction with it. Some of the hardest hit counties are experiencingextreme floodingand up to 50 inches of rain. Houses have been reduced to timber.
Emergency broadcast: The entire area Holiday Park Beach,Fulton, Rockport, apartment buildings have collapsed. Help needed ASAP @NWSCorpus pic.twitter.com/RQ6XAwvvjx
Before Harvey hit, I was skeptical about the reaction to come. Since November 2016, our country has been bitterly divided over things big and small. We’ve fought about tweets, statues, war and foreign powers. Though I’ll never lose hope for my country, I was beginning to grow cynical about the constant infighting.
So I braced myself for a week-long news cycle of Trump-bashing, climate change fear-mongering, and the politicization of a natural disaster.
What I’ve seen since has been entirely different.
This is what makes America so incredible. We’ll toss urine filled bottles at each other one week and wade through contaminated rain water for rescue efforts the next.

Hurricane Harvey is a brutal but profoundly important reminder that although we may fight daily about our politics and skin color, we are all still Americans first. I’ll be the first to admit it, I was worried we were forgetting this. But Harvey is proof that this country hasn’t forgotten how to take care of its own. We have not forgotten how to be Americans.
“Gave proof thro’ the night that our flag was still there”- @9NEWS Photographer Adam Vance & Reporter Noel Brennan workn #HurricaneHarvey pic.twitter.com/grvGj2Lls6
I’m sure the infighting and agonizing will start up again soon. Just as it is American to care for one another, it’s also American to get on Facebook and squabble during lunch. But maybe just for this week, it shouldn’t rattle us the same way. At least five people have died in this storm. This number could have been far greater had helping hands from other states not immediately pitched in. And the rescue efforts could have been far more strained had corporate America notdonated millionsof dollars within the first few days.
There are rare moments when humans are less flaming hot garbage than usual, and in those moments I don’t want to be shot directly into the fucking sun. This is one of those. (tw: @fishblanc, @25park)

"A volunteer organization formed after Hurricane Katrinaattempted to rescue a group of people in Houston who they thought were victims but ended up being a group of looters attempting to steal their boats.
The Cajun Navy posted on their Facebook page on Monday the alleged attack happened as they were trying help victims of Hurricane Harvey:
Clyde and the other team members and teams are all safe. Looters decided to pose as people needing rescue and they attempted to overtake the boats and there were shots fired at the boats. I repeat they are all safe. Looters must have not wanted our boats in the water for rescues. Please feel free to share this post. We are currently on stand down pending a new strategic plan.
The ‘Cajun Navy’ has stood down after looters attempted to commander their boats and fired weapons at said boats. No injuries.#hounewspic.twitter.com/9E9GRcHOOa
The originalFacebook post was removed, however, a presumed volunteer with the group posted a video confirming that shots were fired at the boats.
Police in Houston battled looters throughout the city on Monday leading to dozens of arrests, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo toldABC.
“We’ve already arrested a handful of looters. We’ve made it real clear to our community we’re going to do whatever it takes to protect their homes and their businesses,” Acevedo said.
The Cajun Navy has already made a significant impact in the rescue operations in Houston as they “pulled a lifeless elderly woman from floodwaters and resuscitated her,” The Times-Picayunereported.
Currently, Hurricane Harvey hasclaimedeight lives and thousands are displaced and seeking refuge.

"Yellowstone supervolcano was stuck by a rare and large M4.5 earthquake on Saturday, which experts warn could spark an eruption.
The area just east of Yellowstone was struck near a location which was in the news a few years ago.
Dutchsinse.com reports: The earthquake measured in at a midrange M4.0, meaning this earthquake isnoteworthy enough to cause damage, and directly follows the rare (and rather large) M4.9 which struck in Canada one day prior.
Wyomingwas warned for new M4.0 range activitydue to a M4.9 (M5.0) earthquake which struck to the North a day prior.
The M4.9 Canada earthquake was censored (omitted) from the USGS earthquake feeds forsome reason. A possible reason for the deliberate omission of this earthquake could be due to the fact the town nearby is calledURANIUM CITY, Canada.
Information on the ‘hidden’ / omitted M4.9 earthquake in Canada fromNRCAN here:
Even more interesting than the name of the location is what is actually BELOW the location in question (aside from the possibility of Uranium). There is agiant magma dome (Laccolith)of epic proportions.
Laccoliths, or “magma domes” are large areas which rise due to magma intruding into layers of the crust far down below. They are a weaker point in the crust than surrounding regions which do not have cavities in them.
The oblong oval shaped magma intrusion dome may be a former sill of an ancient volcano, or may be an bulge in crust created by magma intrustion. Regardless of its magma source, the feature is massive in size: measuring over 450 miles long (750km) and nearly 200 miles wide (300km).
This giant dome in Canada moved a day ago, which apparently pushed towards the South along the craton edge , causing the new M4.2 movement near Yellowstone supervolcano.
After the earthquake occurred along the Northern portion of the plate in Canada, within 24 hours, a location on the Eastern edge of the Yellowstone magma chamber was struck bya rare, and noteworthy M4.2 (M4.5) earthquake.
The location which was struck in Wyoming isn’t just any random location, this is a very intriguing point to see activity occur at.
Aside from the name itself having a geothermal origin, Thermopolis Wyoming, the location in questionwas in the news just a couple years agoin 2015.
Ten Sleep , Wyomingwas in the news in 2015(october 2015) due to a very strange, and rare geologic phenomenon which took place across the countryside.
Very close to Ten Sleep, Wyoming a series of large surface fissures (cracks in the ground) formed across multiple mountainsides, and mountaintops. There was never any official explanation given, and the news was quickly forgotten within weeks of occurring.
See all the pictures of the “crack in the ground” event which occurred here:
Now that an earthquake of noteworthy size has struck near Yellowstone, and very close to this ‘fissure’ location, it would be prudent to keep watch for new similar sized earthquake activity ‘down stream’ from these locations.
The locations down stream from Yellowstone can be seen here:
It may also be worthwhile to see if any new surface fissure / cracks have formed in the shallow crust similar to that which occurred in October 2015.
Have an earthquake plan, and keep watch.",1

The Great Famine Of 2009-2012
Authorized for a limited 2009 release by Sister Adalsinda Bachmeier to the readers and subscribers of The Order of the Sisters of Sorcha Faal
Special Offer: $38.00 plus $4.50 Shipping and Handling [US Funds]
When I was asked recently by one of my dear Sisters as to why I had written this book my thoughts traveled back to when I traveled to Bremen after the war with my father in January, 1946, and where the images of starvation and suffering were nearly too powerful for any young girl of 13 to bear, and which have been seared into my mind to this very day.
Our village of Martfeld had remained virtually untouched by the ravages of war due to its rural location and population makeup of mainly Amish Mennonite and Old Order Amish farmers like my father.  The British soldiers who began occupying our region in 1945 were no more, nor no less tolerated by our people than the Nazis had been, both being content that we posed no threat to their order and so we were allowed to continue living our mostly quiet lives.
But, in Bremen on that starkly clear and bitterly cold January day in Bremen I was visiting so long ago, my own quiet mind was shattered forever by the masses of humanity literally starving to death in queues numbering in the thousands for their weekly rations doled out to them by their new British overseers. What had happened to this once fat and happy people? my young mind wondered as I struggled to comprehend the incomprehensible. After all, it had only been 4 years earlier in 1942 that I had last visited this great city whose people seemed like giants to me because of their great height and weight. What had, indeed, happened?
My life since those days has taken me too many different lands of equally suffering human beings, and even though their stories of suffering were different from my own home country, I was amazed to find the many similarities that occurred as precursors to mass starvation, no matter if the cause was war, drought or mass relocation of populations.
These powerful words begin Sister Adalsindas book of warning The Great Famine Of 2009-2012 lays the historical path proving beyond all doubt, to even the most hardened skeptic, that our World is entering into one of its most perilous times it has ever faced and that will find the vast majority of todays Western Nations resembling those of the Third World in just a few short years time.
One of the most astounding evidences of the coming Great Famine, Sister Adalsinda writes,, is staring every one of these Westerners in their very faces as the rates of obesity among them skyrocket to levels not seen since the years before every major Global conflict and every famine ever recorded.  But not being told to these Westerners, Sister Adalsinda continues, is that every human being has within them a psychic-genetic connection that when great famines or lack of access to food for long periods of time are near our bodies shut down their normal metabolic functions and begin storing fat to enable its survival.
Sister Adalsindas research expands on those of other researchers, including Dr. Martin Seligman, an authority on obesity, who states that when a person is subjected to starvation repeatedly or over long periods, the body gradually adjusts by storing more fat in preparation for the next time. This would have been a crucial survival feature in early humans, when hunting seasons could alternate between feast and famine, not only for days but even weeks or months at a time. Natural selection would have favored those who could survive periods of prolonged starvation by storing fat more efficiently.
In her book Sister Adalsinda states that hidden within each and every human beings DNA is a Great Famine Gene that upon its activation by future events it knows will occur, but seldom in todays modern World acknowledged, begins excreting its power over our bodies leading to rapid and sustained weight gain, feelings of hopelessness, depression and acts of self destruction.
Sister Adalsinda further lays out to the reader the actions they need to take, immediately, to begin preparing themselves for a World that is on the very brink of starvation that the ordinary people in the West continue to mistakenly believe will not affect them, but their own bodies are proven they will be the hardest hit.
In her book Sister Adalsinda also explains how the leaders of all the Western Nations have long know of this Great Famine to come and have been preparing for it, right under the very noses of the tens of millions they have consigned to death as not worth saving and have no place in their New World Order they plan to establish to cement their rule over all of the Earth.
This book is a MUST for anyone seriously planning for their and their familys long-term survival as food stocks are beginning to run out all over the World right now, and as Sister Adalsinda explains in her book the current manufactured Global Economic Crisis is but the last and most vital mass population control mechanism put into place for the elite rulers to better manage a starving World.
And if you believe these headlines are going to get better you couldnt be more mistaken!
February 11, 2009 (LPAC)--The current drought in China and California, mark the fact that now harvests are threatened by bad weather, and lack of water infrastructure, in both Northern and Southern Hemisphere farm regions at the same time. This was not so over the past 18 months, when production in the Northern Hemisphere grain belts--China, Russia, France, the U.S. and Canada, somewhat ""made up for"" the drought losses down under in Australia, Argentina and Brazil. No longer. Add to this the impact of the farm credit crisis, commodity speculation and other factors associated with the financial collapse, and the makings of a food catastrophe are at hand.
In an ""unforeseen and unprecedented"" shift, the world food supply is dwindling rapidly and food prices are soaring to historic levels, the top food and agriculture official of the United Nations warned Monday. The changes created ""a very serious risk that fewer people will be able to get food,"" particularly in the developing world, said Jacques Diouf, head of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.
The agency's food price index rose by more than 40 percent this year, compared with 9 percent the year before - a rate that was already unacceptable, he said. New figures show that the total cost of foodstuffs imported by the neediest countries rose 25 percent, to $107 million, in the last year.
China's monthslong drought has worsened in northwestern Gansu even after snow and rainfall eased the crisis in seven other provinces, the Agriculture Ministry said Wednesday.
The ministry's Web site called the current situation ""grim,"" with 80 percent of the farmland for winter crops affected  a total of 1.1 million acres (483,000 hectares)  because of little precipitation, high temperatures and decreased river flow.
In a blow to California farmers struggling with a persistent drought, federal authorities released projections on Friday showing that little or no water would be available from federal sources this year for agricultural use.
State water supplies were also expected to be severely curtailed, state officials said.
The announcements  from the federal Bureau of Reclamation and the California Department of Water Resources  confirmed fears long held by farmers, who had been warned in recent months to expect little water from state and federal reservoirs, which are collectively less than half full.
There IS going to come a time in YOUR very near future when you are either going to be faced with starvation or you will be protected.  The choice of which of these two it is going to be is yours.
Choose wisely.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,and his wife, Jane Sanders have hired prominent defense attorneys amid an FBI investigation into a loan Jane Sanders obtained to expand Burlington College while she was its president, CBS News confirms.
Sanders’ top adviser Jeff Weaver told CBS News the couple has sought legal protection over federal agents’ allegations from a January 2016 complaint accusing then-President of Burlington College, Ms. Sanders, of distorting donor levels in a 2010 loan application for $10 million from People’s United Bank to purchase 33 acres of land for the institution.
According to Politico, prosecutors might also be looking into allegations that Sen. Sanders’ office inappropriately urged the bank to approve the loan.
Sen.

"Fake information will pervade mature economies in the next few years, a new study has noted.
By 2022, most people in mature economies will consume more false information than true information, according to the study from research firm Gartner.
This trend will be fueled, in part, by “confirmation bias,” that “leads all people to seek out, select and value information that parallels what they believe and expect to be proven true,”the study's authors, Magnus Revang and Whit Andrews, found.
FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG ASKS FORGIVENESS FOR WAYS HIS 'WORK WAS USED TO DIVIDE PEOPLE
And even improved artificial intelligence (AI), which companies like Facebook and Google are working on, won’t be able to stop it, a separate study by Gartner found. ""Counterfeit reality"" or fake content, will “outpace AI's ability to detect it.""
Generating false information will always cost less than the cost of detecting it. “False information will consequently outpace true information where there is economic or political interest to purvey it,”Revang andAndrews wrote.
Fake information and fake news is an extremely complicated topic that is often painted with a broad brush that belies its complexity, Paula Bolyard, Supervising Editor at PJ Media, told Fox News via email.
“It's true that ‘fake news’ is easier and less costly to produce than factual news reporting,"" Bolyard said. ""A separate, parallel, issue is the demand for instant reactions to newsworthy events.”
Bolyard added, “Original reporting is labor intensive and the 24-hour news cycle creates a sense of urgency that values speed over accuracy. As a result, sometimes even legitimate news sources get stories wrong in the rush to be first.”
FACEBOOK, TWITTER: HOW SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION
President Trump has revisited the fake news theme regularly. This week, he lashed out a report from NBC that claimed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson considered resigning over the summer amid disagreements with the White House.
“The @NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec. Tillerson and @VP Pence. It is #FakeNews. They should issue an apology to AMERICA!” – Trump tweeted on Wednesday.
The President has also cited CNN's constant spotlighting of the administration's alleged ""Russia collusion"" as fake news.
The issue is, the term ""fake news"" is used liberally by both the left and right.
“A major theme for 2017 in politics and media worldwide has been the issue of the creation of ‘fake news,’” the Gartner analysts said in the study. The indiscriminate use of the of the term has “many stops along a spectrum” from discrediting “true information to its proper use to describe wholly false information,” they added.
But Bolyard argues that despite the mainstreaming of fake news in countries like Russia, it's not as bad as we may be led to believe.
“I don't think the situation is quite as dire as the study predicts,"" she said. ""While fake news will continue to be a problem, I think perhaps we're reaching a tipping point where people are becoming more skeptical and more discerning with their media choices.""",0

"The statement also accused Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe of being “one of the chief members of networks of adversary institutions, who — with the direction and support of foreign media and espionage services — has committed her criminal acts over the past few years.”
Mr. Ratcliffe was quoted by Reuters as calling the accusations against his wife “preposterous” charges that appeared to be a political case.
He has been outspoken in calling for her release and started an online petition that now has more than 764,000 signatures.
The Revolutionary Guards statement seemed directed at the Thomson Reuters company, a global media powerhouse regarded with suspicion and hostility in Iran because of its British foundations. Reuters merged with Canada’s Thomson company in 2008.
“The media corporations of hegemonic governments, especially the evil-minded British media, have made their best efforts in the recent months to support her in order to weaken the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ determination but this false hope will never come true,” the statement added.
In 2012 Thomson Reuters’ press accreditation was suspended in Iran after the news agency was accused of having lied in a video report that asserted Iranian housewives were training to become ninja assassins. (A misleading headline in the report was corrected.)
The suspended accreditation followed the closing of the British Embassy in Tehran after it had been attacked by hard-line protesters.
The government of President Hassan Rouhani has reportedly been in discussions to allow a Thomson Reuters bureau to reopen. Hard-liners are opposed to what they view as increased influence by Westerners.
Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has never worked inside Iran, according to a statement released on Wednesday by the Thomson Reuters Foundation chief executive, Monique Villa.
“Nazanin has been working at the Thomson Reuters Foundation for the past four years as a project coordinator in charge of grants applications and training, and had no dealing with Iran in her professional capacity,” the statement said. “The Thomson Reuters Foundation has no dealings with Iran whatsoever, does not operate and does not plan to operate in the country.”
The intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards has arrested several dual citizens over recent months. The latest such arrest was last week, when a Canadian-Iranian professor researching women, Homa Hoodfar, was arrested on undisclosed charges.
The semiofficial Mashregh news organization reported Wednesday that she was accused of collaborating with two organizations that “are working to diminish religiosity and equal gender rights.”
Mashregh criticized the two organizations, Women Living Under Muslim Laws, and Hivos, a human rights advocacy group based in The Hague, for “emphasizing women’s control of their own bodies and choosing to live single.”

"‘With Open Gates: The forced collective suicide of European nations’, a slick, hard-hitting film about the European migrant crisis is going viral in Europe, already watched at least half a million times.
Although the 19-minute film may feel like a dispatch from the future, it is cut entirely from recent news reports, police camera footage, and interviews. Kicking off with scenes of a modern car ferry disgorging thousands of illegals into Greece, the film then cuts to dozens of aerial shots of columns of migrants marching north into Europe.
The film then changed to the harrowing testimony of one young Greek woman who was unable to hide her horror and despair at the scale of the migrant crisis sweeping over her home island of Lesbos. Just sixmiles from the Turkish coast, the island was subjected to migrant riots in September as newcomers turned on their hosts for not moving them to mainland Europe fast enough.
AsBreitbart London reported at the time, the tearful woman tells a news crew: “We are in danger, every day, every minute. We need someone to protect us. They come into our houses. I want to go to work, but I can’t. Our children want to go to school, but they can’t. They have stolen our lives!”.
Also featured is American presidential hopeful Donald Trump, who gives his opinion on the migrant crisis: “I’ve been watching this migration, and I’ve seen the people.
“I mean, these are men. They are mostly men, and they are strong men… they look like prime time solders. Look, Europe is going to have to handle, but they are going to have riots in Germany.
“I always thought Merkel was a great leader, but what she’s done in Germany is insane”.
The video is being rapidly shared on social media and online message boards and has been viewed at least half a million times, having been uploaded to platforms including YouTube and Facebook among others dozens of times.
Although the main thrust of the film is to goad native Europeans against mass migration and the negative effects of multiculturalism, the film also paradoxically takes a swipe at one European minority group who stand to lose almost the most from mass Muslim immigration. It also includes a short clip of discredited, anti-Semitic politician Nick Griffin, former Member of the European Parliament and leader of the British National Party.
The inclusion of Mr. Griffin, an unpopular figure even in Britain’s nationalist right and the rapid success of the film in the Netherlands suggests the film may not have been edited by a British citizen.
Breitbart London has reported at length on the rising tide of anti-Semitism in Europe which has arrived with mass migration. From Jews being specifically targeted for degrading house-invasion rape-thefts to Jews being excluded from Holocaust commemorations because of Muslim attendeeshijacking events, migrant-Europe is now hostile towards Jews at a level not seen in decades.
Below the video on YouTube, uploaded on Monday by anonymous user Death of Nations, the editor warns: “This video will not be online long, download and mirror it while you can”.
“At current immigration levels and disappearing birth rates native Europeans are destined to become a minority in their own countries within decades. This is already the case for many of Europe’s largest cities.”
“Millions of young Muslim men leave behind their family, pay thousands to criminal traffickers to reach the land they have been promised by European politicians illegally.
Dubbed by the media as “refugees”, they cross through 6-10 safe countries to reach wealthy nations like Germany or Sweden where they hope to receive a better life at the expense of the taxpayer.
Only a fraction of them are Syrian, as they enter unfiltered, without any documents and without any legitimate right to claim asylum. Women and children are rarely seen, except in the cherry-picked sob stories of the media”.
At the end of the lengthy call to arms, the writer concludes:
“We are still at a point where you will not get imprisoned for your political opinion in most European countries, but this will change very soon. Do not be apathetic, do not be weak. Be someone that can be proud to call himself European”.",1
"Sean Hannity is officially going after CNN’s CEO Jeff Zucker. First, heposted a story on Twitter about Donald Trump Jr. calling for scrutiny of Zucker’s fake news.
“The hypocrisy at CNN is astounding,” Trump, Jr. said. “Facing the biggest fake news scandal in the network’s history after an embarrassing retraction, nobody from the network is answering questions–even to their own reporters–and they have the audacity to demand on-camera press briefings from the White House to boost their ratings and make their personalities famous?
“Maybe Jeff Zucker should do an on-camera press briefing about CNN’s fake news scandal before the White House does any more of them,” Trump Jr. concluded.
Then, Hannity chimed in — being a little more direct.
“Hey CNN, when will you fire Zucker? He has destroyed the network with lies and VERY FAKE NEWS.”

"A Republican representative in Hawaii, cited as a rising star on the right, told NBC News Thursday she no longer felt she was in the position to defend the GOP, one day after her colleagues ousted her as House minority leader.
Rep. Beth Fukumoto, who served as the Hawaii House minority leader since 2014, said she became the subject of intense criticism from her caucus after her participation in the Women's March in Honolulu on Jan. 21, where she spoke out against the racism and bigotry that had become associated with the Republican Party, as well as the rhetoric and actions of President Donald Trump.
""There were many little girls watching [the election] who walked away believing that you can bully people and still win,"" Fukumoto told NBC News. ""And what I said at the march was that regardless of who we voted for in the election, it was all of our responsibilities to show those same kids that in the end kindness and respect should always win.""
Within 24 hours of her speech, Fukumoto said she was receiving calls and texts from her colleagues to meet, as well as fielding calls for her resignation for speaking out against the president.
On Wednesday, all but one of Fukumoto's colleagues voted to remove her from her leadership position.
""What ended up being very problematic for me was that my caucus and others said, 'If you want to stay in leadership, then you need to make a commitment to not criticize the president for the remainder of his term,'"" Fukumoto said. ""And with what we've been seeing in the news with the different executive orders coming out every day, I didn't believe I could make that commitment.""
Fukumoto added that she disagreed with the direction the Republican Party was heading in. ""It seems to be punishing dissent, and when you have a political party, you need dialogue,"" she said.
This is not the first time Fukumoto has spoken up in opposition to her party. In an op-ed for NBC News last year, the 33-year-old legislator — who, until Wednesday, was the country's youngest female caucus leader — described her previous clash with a Republican colleague who accused her of not being ""truly Republican because my tone or stature is not oppositional enough.""
RELATED: Op-Ed: Despite Current Environment, the Republican Party Is Worth Saving
Fukumoto isn't alone in her perspective. In 2014, her predecessor, former House minority leader Rep. Aaron Ling Johanson, announced his decision to leave the Republican Party and became a Democrat, saying he felt the GOP had become ""more narrow in their demands for ideological purity.""
""Rather than being focused on remaining the loyal opposition as some would like, and I understand that some Republicans really want that,"" Johanson said at the time, according to Hawaii News Now. ""That's not who I am, that's not who I committed to be. And I just look forward to making a collaborative, constructive and positive difference.""
Johanson continues to serve in the Hawaii House of Representatives, and was re-elected last year as a Democrat.
RELATED: Young Asian-American Republicans Troubled by What Trump Is Doing to Their Party
Fukumoto said she had experienced Johanson's thought process closely at the time as the floor leader, and that both she and Johanson had hope the party could change.
In a letter to her constituents this week, Fukumoto announced her desire to leave the GOP and asked for their comments and feedback before making anything official.
If she leaves the Republican Party, Fukumoto told NBC News she would look to join the Democrats.
In a statement released Wednesday, Hawaii Republican Party Chair Fritz Rohlfing urged Fukumoto to remain in the party even though she no longer was the leader. ""I believe she still can fulfill an important role as a Republican member of the State House,"" Rohlfing said.
But, Rohlfing added, should Fukumoto choose to leave the party three months after being re-elected as a Republican, he felt it was only appropriate that she immediately resign from her seat entirely so the GOP could have time to propose replacements to Gov. David Ige.
During Wednesday's vote, fellow Republican Rep. Cynthia Thielen, who also spoke during the Women's March, criticized the caucus for punishing Fukumoto ""for participating in the democratic process.""
Thielen went on to defend Fukumoto's leadership and praised her contributions to the Republican Party. Adding that although she herself had no plans to leave the party she's been a member of for more than six decades, Thielen's voice broke as she criticized the GOP for pushing Fukumoto out.
""I'm going to be there and continue that fight but, God, I am sorry to lose our minority leader, someone I so deeply, deeply respect — the face of Republicanism as it should be, but it won't be anymore,"" Thielen said.
In her 2016 op-ed, Fukumoto wrote, despite the increasing partisanship and divisiveness, she believed the GOP was worth saving.
Today, she isn't so sure.
""I think there are a lot of Republicans feeling that way right now, that the forces against change are just so strong and that even though many of us believe there’s still something worth saving, we don’t think we that we can do it,"" she said.",0

"Harvey Weinstein hired an elite private agency run by former intelligence officers to gather information on women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, and specifically targeted accuser Rose McGowan, a source familiar with the investigation told ABC News.
The use of the company -- called Black Cube -- was first reported by Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker. Farrow appeared on ""Good Morning America"" Tuesday to discuss his latest New Yorker piece and what he calls ""an international campaign"" on behalf of Weinstein to keep his accusers from coming forward.
""This was elaborate and expensive,"" Farrow said. ""This was all conducted in secrecy ... I think the story makes it clear that they were focusing on everyone trying to get word out about this.""
A spokeswoman for Weinstein told The New Yorker about this new report, “It is a fiction to suggest that any individuals were targeted or suppressed at any time.”
Farrow's latest piece alleges Weinstein hired multiple firms -- including Black Cube -- to gather information from the accusers and from reporters working on stories.
The report claims that one Black Cube operative, whose real name was not used in the story, reached out to McGowan, posing as an activist launching an initiative to combat discrimination against women in the workplace. The story adds that the same investigator also contacted a reporter for New York magazine saying she had allegations against Weinstein to share.
That reporter, Ben Wallace, told The New Yorker, the woman, using a different name than the one she used with McGowan, asked him “about the status and scope of my inquiry, and about who I might be talking to, without giving me any meaningful help or information.”
Farrow said he used a photograph of this operative to conclude that McGowan and Wallace were talking about the same woman. The operative also allegedly emailed Farrow himself and New York Times reporter Jodi Kantor under an assumed name when they were working on Weinstein stories. Kantor was one of the reporters on the Times story back on Oct. 5, alleging Weinstein reached confidential settlements with some harassment accusers over several decades.
Furthermore, a source familiar with the alleged investigative work done for Weinstein confirmed to ABC News that McGowan was specifically targeted and that Black Cube secured a part of the transcript of McGowan's upcoming memoir ""Brave"" through its undercover agent. McGowan has been outspoken on social media, accusing Weinstein of sexual assault.
“Black Cube was hired to find out about the people who were launching a campaign against Harvey Weinstein. Shareholders, partners, journalists and Rose McGowan,"" the source told ABC News. “Black Cube ended the contract in July. A couple loose ends were tied up in August, but the contract ended in July. They felt that they could not help him anymore.”
This source information comes after an official statement to ABC News from Black Cube that did not admit to working with Weinstein, but did say they work on “uncovering negative campaigns.” However, the company had said it does not get involved in “sexual harassment cases.”
“It is Black Cube’s policy to never discuss its clients with any third party, and to never confirm or deny any speculation made with regard to the company’s work,"" the company said in a statement. ""Black Cube supports the work of many leading law firms around the world, especially in the U. S., gathering evidence for complex legal processes, involving commercial disputes, among them uncovering negative campaigns. The company does not get involved in family disputes or sexual harassment cases. It should be highlighted that Black Cube applies high moral standards to its work, and operates in full compliance with the law of any jurisdiction in which it operates -- strictly following the guidance and legal opinions provided by leading law firms from around the world.”
Since the first Times report on Weinstein in early October, dozens of women have made allegations of harassment and abuse against the former studio head in the New Yorker, on social media and in other media outlets. There have been serious repercussions after the allegations: Weinstein was terminated by his eponymous company, and he later resigned from its board; he was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, among other organizations; and his wife, Marchesa designer Georgina Chapman, announced last month that she was leaving him. Additionally, he is under investigation by police in four jurisdictions -- New York City, Beverly Hills, Los Angeles and London.
Weinstein has denied ""any allegations of nonconsensual sex"" via his spokeswoman.
""Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual,"" according to the full statement from Weinstein's spokesperson. ""Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.”",0

"An early 2017 study found The Gateway Pundit Was 4th Most Influential Right-Leaning Media Outlet during last year’s election.
Only Breitbart, The Hill and FOX News were more influential to conservative audiences.
The Columbia Journalism Review published an article in March entitled “Study: Breitbart-led Right-wing Media Ecosystem Altered Broader Media Agenda” that reported these conclusions.
Now according to another analysis of the 2016 Presidential election, the Gateway Pundit was again listed as one of the most shared media sources on the right in 2016.
TheBerkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University recently releasedtheirreport entitled, “Partisanship, Propaganda, and Disinformation: Online Media and the 2016 U. S. Presidential Election”. In the Executive Summary of the report they state the following:
In this study, we analyze both mainstream and social media coverage of the 2016 United States presidential election. We document that the majority of mainstream media coverage was negative for both candidates, but largely followed Donald Trump’s agenda: when reporting on Hillary Clinton, coverage primarily focused on the various scandals related to the Clinton Foundation and emails. When focused on Trump, major substantive issues, primarily immigration, were prominent. Indeed, immigration emerged as a central issue in the campaign and served as a defining issue for the Trump campaign.
We find that the structure and composition of media on the right and left are quite different. The leading media on the right and left are rooted in different traditions and journalistic practices. On the conservative side, more attention was paid to pro-Trump, highly partisan media outlets. On the liberal side, by contrast, the center of gravity was made up largely of long-standing media organizations steeped in the traditions and practices of objective journalism.
Of course, coming out of Far Left Harvard, the individuals who released the study ignore the fact that honest conservative media outlets like this one were created exactly because the Far Left leaning mainstream media (MSM) is nothing more than ‘highly partisan’ political talking heads for the globalist Democrat Party agenda.
We agree with the article in that President Trump succeeded in setting the discussion on issues during the election, such as immigration, jobs, etc. Conservatives and Americans were more interested in debating these issues than Hillary’s entire campaign message “I am a woman, vote for me”.
The Harvard Study presents some interesting results. The Gateway Punditwas one of the most popular conservative media outlets during the election.
The article also shows the relationship that conservative outlets maintained with each other during the election as noted in in the chart below showing Facebook shares:
This study is very similar to the study published in the Columbia Journalism Review whichwasfunded by George Soros’s Open Society Foundations U. S. Program.
As noted in our post about the CJR study, we believe our efforts at the GWP helped President Trump immensely. Many of our readers have shared their gratitude for a job well done.
Here are some additional assertions about the 2016 election that the study does not surmise:
Americans want accurate, informative, and up to date information NOW and the MSM behemoths cannot or will not provide this service.
As a result of the above, Americans are flocking in droves to new media sites like the GWP in order to obtain the truth that is not shared in the traditional MSM.
The new media like the GWP did not originate due to American’s desire for sensationalism, the new media originated as a consequence of the MSM failing to share the truth.
Thank you all for your support.

"The ousting of Bill O’Reilly from Fox News is generating major headlines. Radio host Glenn Beck shared an email he received upon request from O’Reilly’s attorneys that suggests George Soros and Media Matters might be the reason advertisers stopped sponsoring The O’Reilly Factor.
George Soros-funded Media Matters has a history of conducting smear campaigns against conservative media figures like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck. Their latest target looks to be Bill O’Reilly, host of the wildly popular and number one-rated cable news program The O’Reilly Factor on Fox News. Glenn shared on radio today an email that suggests the liberal watchdog is behind the advertiser exodus from The Factor.
Beck received this email from Mary Pat Boomer from The Bonner Group.
”It’s from Mary Pat Bonner. Now, who is Mary Pat Bonner? Mary Pat Bonner runs what’s called the Bonner Group. The Bonner Group, according to the New York Times, was paid $6 million from Hillary For America — or whatever it was — and Media Matters to raise money. Another source — we’re not sure. We only have one source on this — said that Media Matters paid the Bonner Group $1.4 million in 2013 alone, to raise money. They are the largest fundraiser for Media Matters, at least in 2013 and raised $11 million for Media Matters. This is the Hillary super PAC group and the super PAC for Media Matters. That’s who Mary Pat Bonner is.
“So Mary Pat Bonner who is trying to raise money for Media Matters sends this out: An O’Reilly update call.
Subject line. It came out Thursday April 13th, 2:53 p.m. For years, Bill O’Reilly has been one of the worst purveyors of misinformation on Fox News. A serial misinformer, pushing many of the most extreme, sexist, racist, homophobic, and xenophobic conservative theories on TV.”
One of the countless reasons Clinton lost the election was the strength of the conservative media in shooting down liberal “fake news”. Clinton is widely reported to be festering with rage following her brutal, humiliating defeat to a man she loathed and hated. If the Clinton connections insinuated in the Broomer email prove to be true, it would pave the way to start many more investigations into how heinous and deep Clinton’s vendetta against the right runs. It also further illustrates how George Soros should be high up on Interpol’s list of Most Wanted.",1

Co-owner and chef Zenebech Dessu in the kitchen at Zenebech. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)   Ethiopian meals rank among the most intimate in the world. Even if a group of you order separate entrees, they’re all served on the same platter, invariably lined with injera, the tangy crepe-like bread that looks like a folded napkin but does double duty as both canvas and eating utensil. Sharing is expected, in other words. Among the sweetest displays of public affection is gursha (“mouthful” in Amharic), whereby one diner wraps some food in a swatch of injera and feeds another. If the feeling is mutual, the honor is returned.  Ethiopian cooking rates as some of my favorite, a sentiment born from my days as a student in Washington with an appetite for adventure but not a lot of money. Back then, Adams Morgan was ground zero for the stews known as tibs eaten around the basket-tables called mesobs. Celebrations — a new internship, the end of finals, the weekend — saw bottles of tej, honey-sweetened wine, being uncorked.   Nostalgia recently drew me back to the neighborhood, prompted by the news that Zenebech, one of the city’s longtime East African outposts, had finally relocated to larger quarters in Adams Morgan after shuttering in pricey Shaw last year. Equally compelling is the flavor profile, similar to that of my favorite cuisine, Indian, a tapestry of warm spices and addictive heat.  My first taste of Zenebech is a sambusa, often the only appetizer you’ll see on an Ethiopian menu. The fried turnovers, assembled from wonton skins by chef and co-owner Zenebech Dessu, 65, come with three fillings — lentil, beef or chicken — and while each is delicious, best in class is minced chicken pulsing with garlic, ginger and black pepper. Take a moment to crack the golden packet, its texture as snappy as a fortune cookie; the pastry is served lawsuit-hot, and only sometimes with a warning. But $2.50 buys you several bites of serious pleasure, and if your server thinks to offer it with the red dip that tastes like ketchup having a temper tantrum, so much the finer.
Goden tibs, middle, surrounded by other dishes on injera. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)    One test of an Ethiopian kitchen is doro wat, a zesty chicken stew that takes hours to make and is considered a source of pride on its home turf. Indeed, in earlier times, men were known to judge potential wives on how they made their doro wat. The base relies on onions that are cooked to near-melting with clarified butter and berbere, the incendiary seasoning that takes your tongue to Addis Ababa. The chicken, which simmers to tenderness in the sauce, the color of lava but more of a tease than a torch, is presented with a hard-cooked egg. Consider the test passed at Zenebech.   [The 10 best Ethiopian restaurants in the D. C. area]  There are few Ethiopian dishes as captivating as the combination vegetable platter, reminiscent of a painter’s palette with its dabs of salads and stews in green and brown as well as autumnal shades of orange, gold and red. Zenebech’s edible pinwheel is no exception; the injera’s zones include tangy collard greens, dusky red lentils whose burn (from berbere) reveals itself over time, a tomato and onion salad spiked with chopped jalapeo, slightly sweet brown lentils and mellow yellow ones.  A menu item called 50/50 lets a customer order two meat entrees for $13. For contrast, and in deference to companions who aren’t hot heads, I tend to pair something mild, perhaps bozena shiro, tender bites of beef in a gravy of chickpeas and yellow lentils, with something racy, such as kitfo, Ethiopia’s version of steak tartare. Kitfo can be cooked rare, medium or not at all. The third option is likely to elicit a smile from your server. The best way to enjoy quality minced beef, glossed with seasoned butter and hair-raising heat, is raw.  To look at dulet is to be tempted to judge a book by its cover and opt for another dish. The gray-brown mash of lamb tripe and liver, along with beef and fiery peppers, is known to test some diners’ limits, but to them I say: The mix, with its pleasant mineral tang, is rich. The kitchen also makes a very good fish dulet, chopped tilapia that looks a bit like snow speckled with minced jalapeo, among other flavor bombs.
Hannah Katzen, left, and Vicki Harrington eat dinner at Zenebech. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)     My eyes lit up at the sight of curry goat on the list, goat being my red meat of choice, although the dish was a letdown. Chewy meat in a vague broth, thickened with potato chunks, won’t get my repeat business. In contrast, I happily gnawed on goden tibs, beef short ribs that have been fried so the edges are crusty, and tore off pieces of injera, perforated like coral, with my right hand (only) to ferry sweet onions and sharp jalapeos from platter to mouth.   [Zenebech Injera, once the best Ethiopian restaurant in D.C., is reopening this summer]  Sometimes glimpsed through a small kitchen window, the chef whips up her own injera, using a combination of wheat and teff, the high-protein grain native to Ethiopia and also known as lovegrass. (Gluten-free injera or rice is also available). A pleasantly sour all-teff version, imported from abroad, is another option, but it lacks the elasticity and moistness of the fresh product. The tidy, two-room storefront, ably managed by the chef’s sons, Michael and Surafal Demissie, is dressed with glossy wood tables, a skylight and souvenirs Dessu collected on a trip to her homeland in May, including paintings of daily life in Ethiopia, some created by an artist-niece. A faux fire lights up the center of a wine rack. Zenebech 2.0 comes with an amenity the original lacked: a full bar, just off the entrance. If you crave a martini with your food, no problem. The wine that best compliments the quilt of flavors is the crisp rosé from Domaine Bellevue in the Loire Valley, fragrant with cherry notes.  A window seat looks onto a world of competition across the street: signs inviting you to try meze, pasta, jumbo pizza slices, Indian, Korean and Mexican. If my experiences are a gauge, one date with Zenebech is likely to lead to more Ethiopian.  A chalkboard sign outside flags passersby with daily specials and, charmingly, English translations of greetings and other Ethiopian expressions. On my last visit, I jotted down “ahmesugenalew” for future use. I hope to poke my head in the kitchen and say “Thank you” in the chef’s native tongue.

A new video series from The Washington Post",0
"People have long accused the media of being a proxy branch of the State Department, a highly sophisticated and well-produced form of manufactured consensus and controlled opposition all rolled into one. In ostensibly democratic nations, a free and independent press is of paramount importance. But in the U. S., we find a cohesion of the state and corporate news networks that do not constitute ‘state-run media’ in the traditional sense — but it’s close.
Our first solid documentation that the media is an echo chamber for the government came with the disclosure of what has come to be calledOperation Mockingbird. This nefarious and far-reaching conspiracy was documented in Part 1 and involved the CIA essentially conscripting journalists, American news agencies, and major broadcasters to become domestic propagandists andspies. Eventually, this CIA/media symbiosis included journalists from all the top news organizations. Literally, thousands of people were involved.
This infiltration of the American media and press took place during the 1950s, at the start of the Cold War, and was carried out under the auspices of fighting communism. The CIA began torestrict its useof journalists in the Operation Mockingbird program in 1976, but many people believe it has since transmogrified into something far more powerful, nefarious, and ubiquitous today. We’re still in the early stages of proving to the masses that mainstream media is little more than a mouthpiece and propaganda machine for the government and itsvarious agencies, but the evidence is accumulating.
During the 2016 presidential election, Wikileaks exposed a number of disturbing revelations showingcollusionbetween the media and political operatives. This included collusion between the media, the Democratic National Committee, and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But it wasn’t just about swaying the election. New revelations showed that the government actively infiltrates powerful media corporations in order to shape their content and narratives. One of the best examples of this was the State Department’s role in affecting aCBS 60 Minutesinterviewwith Julian Assange.
A more comprehensive list of examples of the Orwellian symbiotic relationship between the press and the government can be foundhere.
Perhaps the most disturbing recent addition to this chapter was the “Countering Disinformation Act” that President Obama slipped into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) on Christmas Eve of last year. In the context of the still-festering narrative offoreign interferencein the 2016 presidential election, the act’s putative goal was to fight “fake news,” which many believe is actually a campaign to silence and dismantle alternative media on the Internet.
In order to accomplish this, the government is establishing a Global Engagement Center for managing disinformation and propaganda. Since we already know our government routinely performs psychological operations (psyops, or as they’ve been recently rebranded, Military Information Support Operations [MISO]), it should come as no surprise that manipulating the civilian population is a permanent goal. In fact, in the2013 National Defense Authorization Act, the government formally legalized the use of psyops on U. S. citizens. So how does this Global Engagement Center factor in?
“The Center is authorized to provide grants or contracts of financial support to civil society groups, media content providers, nongovernmental organizations, federally funded research and development centers, private companies, or academic institutions for the following purposes:
To support local independent media who are best placed to refute foreign disinformation and manipulation in their own communities.
To collect and store examples in print, online, and social media, disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda directed at the United States and its allies and partners.
To analyze and report on tactics, techniques, and procedures of foreign information warfare with respect to disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda.
To support efforts by the Center to counter efforts by foreign entities to use disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda to influence the policies and social and political stability of the United States and United States allies and partner nations.”
While it may not immediately strike one as sinister, this codification of repressing journalists and voices the government deems to be disinformation while creating an even more centralized infrastructure to control “fact-based narratives” in the media should be highly alarming to anyone who cares about a free press. It would seem that while the State already has a steel grip on corporate news networks, they are struggling to control the influence of online independent media. This new law may be the start of this century’s Operation Mockingbird — a new full-scale infiltration of thelocal newsand a war against anti-establishment narratives on the Internet. This isalready taking the formof algorithmic censorship through Facebook and Google, as well as a weaponization of the “fake news” narrative.",1

Snopes used to be a fun site to find out whether wonky stories were true or not. You could find out if Mentos and Diet Coke could kill you, whether the Loch Ness monster is real, and many other urban legends.
With the “Age of the SJWs,” times have changed for the worse. Snopes revealed themselves as Left-wing hacks. They now work with Google and Facebook to block “fake news,” BUT by fake news, we mean anything posted by a conservative news site. It looks like their bias may have landed them in a predicament because they are all over the Internet begging for money, according to The Daily Caller.
Snopes’ donation page reveals just how different they are now. They got into an argument with one of their ad vendors, and instead of ending the partnership, the company is placing MORE ads and withholding all of the revenue from the faux fact-checking website.
The page reads, “As misinformation has increasingly threatened democracies around the world (including our own), Snopes.com has stood in the forefront of fighting for truth and dispelling misinformation online.”
It sounds nice, but they have been busted misleading their readers on stories that are based on the liberal and the Leftist agenda. They are also guilty of publishing fake news when writing stories about conservatives.
The dispute with their ad vendor might have something to do with the obvious bias that they show. The story involving the supplier is too complicated for there to not be SOMETHING there. Things like this do not spontaneously happen.
According to Snopes, the vendor “continues to essentially hold the Snopes.com web site hostage.” [sic] The vendor is not recognizing the termination of the contract and continues to do what they have always done–aside from paying the owners of Snopes their share of the profits.
Snopes continues, “Although we maintain editorial control (for now), the vendor will not relinquish the site’s hosting to our control, so we cannot modify the site, develop it, or — most crucially — place advertising on it.”
In an effort to save their website, they started a GoFundMe account. Unfortunately for people who hate fake news, they almost reached their $500,000 goal in one day. About 16,500 people have made donations, according to The Federalist Papers, and the website seems like it is going to continue running as usual. However, they are no longer getting any revenue from the site itself.
At any moment, donations could run dry, and they would be forced to close. This would be a win for the people seeking the truth. Many people go to Snopes and take it as gospel, despite their obvious bias.
It is sad to see a once-beloved site turn into this Left-wing propaganda machine, but there is nothing left to do. If they are shut down due to the issue with their vendor, we can be left with good memories of Snopes before political correctness strangled the life–and good–out of them.

"Fox News host Bill O’Reilly has been a frequent guest on the liberal ABC talk showThe View, most famously when he caused Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg to walk off the show in 2011 because he saidthat “Muslims killed us on 9/11!” Now, however, O’Reilly has promised that he will never appear onThe Viewagain after Joy Behar questioned the mental stability of Donald Trump.
During her show on Wednesday, Behar claimed Trump isnot “right in the head” and said he “has never appeared stable.”
“It’s not that I don’t agree with him,” Behar said, according to IJ Review. “He isn’t right in the head.The first time I met President Obama, on this show, I said the one thing you say about this man and his wife is that they’re ‘mentally stable.’ Donald Trump has never appeared stable when he’s come on the show.”
Afterward, O’Reilly told Fox News host Martha MacCallum that he will never appear on the ABC show again.
I’m never going on ‘The View’ again, OK? Here’s why. Roll tape,” O’Reilly said. “OK, so there’s Behar saying that the president-elect is not right in the head. Enough, alright? That’s ABC News, by the way. These aren’t some clowns running around the entertainment division. This is ABC News. That’s a disgrace. Now, the ratings for that program are down fairly significantly.”
MacCallum explained thatThe Viewhad moved from ABC’s entertainment division to their news division.
“As you rightly point out, they moved them from entertainment to the news division because they thought the comparison would be more favorable in the ratings, but they lost about 300,000 viewers over the course of that time,”she said.
“That’s it.No more ‘View’ for me,” he declared.

As if the beaches, the surfing and the scenic Sydney waterfront weren’t enough reason to visit Australia, the commonwealth’s latest McDonald’s sandwich is sure bring in fast food lovers from around the world.
McDonald’s locations throughout Australia have officially added the Chicken Big Mac — one of their oft-requested “secret items” — to the restaurants’ official menus for a limited time, reports News.com.au.
“The iconic Big Mac and the McChicken are among our most popular burgers, so it made sense to mix up these two classics and give our customers a new and exciting product to try — the Chicken Big Mac,” said Jenni Dill, CTO of McDonald’s Australia.
McDonald’s new Chicken Big Mac offering is basically a Big Mac made with two breaded chicken patties in place of beef. All other components of the sandwich remain identical to that of a Big Mac (i.e., special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, a sesame seed bun), except the new packaging, which boasts the phrase, “Same taste, but different.”
A post shared by Elliott Martin (@bigell90) on
Before May 31, when the Chicken Big Mac officially debuted Down Under, chicken sandwich lovers were forced to purchase two McChicken sandwiches and cobble together their own Chicken Big Macs, or custom-order a Big Mac made with McChicken patties. Occurrences were actually frequent enough that Australia’s News.com.au referred to these makeshift sandwiches as “regularly requested” items.

Indeed, Twitter contains evidence of foodies from Australia and the U. S. who have dabbled in hacking their Macs with chicken. Sometimes while intoxicated:

In addition to the Chicken Big Mac, McDonald’s Australia is bringing Shaker Fries back to the menu. Originally introduced by McDonald’s Australia in 2011, Shaker Fries include an order of McDonald’s french fries and a packet of powdered cheeseburger-flavored seasoning, which can then be dumped into a paper sack (provided by Mickey D’s) and shaken together to impart a cheeseburger-y flavor to the fries. Already, McDonald’s consumers across Australia are ordering both the Shaker Fries and Chicken Big Mac while the promotion lasts:

McDonald’s Australia will be offering its Chicken Big Mac and Shaker Fries through July 18. According to Mashable, however, McDonald's customers in Qatar, the UAE, the Netherlands and Egypt have already been able to order Chicken Big Macs at their local locations.

"The news of Halladay’s death was quickly followed by expressions of grief on social media.
“We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay’s untimely death,” the Phillies said in a statement posted to Twitter. “There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.”
A two-time Cy Young Award winner and an eight-time All-Star, Halladay was a 6-foot-6 right-hander known for his durability and command.
After 12 major league seasons with the Blue Jays, who drafted him in 1995, he was traded to the Phillies in December 2009. Halladay made 2010 a definitive year in his career. He threw the 20th perfect game in major league history during the regular season, and in a division playoff series against Cincinnati, he threw the second no-hitter in postseason history.
After the postseason no-hitter, Dusty Baker, the Reds’ manager at the time and a fixture in the sport going back to the late 1960s, said, “That is the best-pitched game I’ve seen since I’ve been going to the playoffs and the World Series.”
One of the strongest messages of condolence on social media came from Pedro Martinez, the three-time Cy Young Award winner whose prime coincided with Halladay’s.
Halladay’s career was cut short by back trouble, however. He became a much weaker pitcher in the 2012 and 2013 seasons, and he retired at 36, signing a one-day contract with Toronto to leave the game as a Blue Jay.
Based on his retirement date, Halladay will not be considered for election to baseball’s Hall of Fame until 2019, but he will have a strong case because of his dominance in his strongest seasons. His career record of 203-105 and his 2,117 career strikeouts are not eye-popping numbers, but using the JAWS system, an evaluation tool that accounts for a player’s peak seasons as well as his overall career, Halladay is ranked as baseball’s 42nd-best starting pitcher. Only nine players ahead of him are not yet in the Hall of Fame, while more than 30 pitchers below him on the list are already enshrined in Cooperstown. His postseason success and his popularity with the news media also bolster his case.
Shortly after he retired, Halladay discussed how odd it felt  not to play baseball.
“I find myself kind of sitting around the house thinking, ‘There’s something missing here — I should be working out, I should be running, I should be doing something,’” Halladay said. “For a second, it’s kind of a little bit of panic, and then it kind of sets in: ‘O. K., that’s right. I’m retiring now.’ It’s actually a very peaceful feeling.”
He eventually turned to flying as an outlet, and in October he posted pictures of the plane he had recently purchased.
Halladay, whose father was a pilot, knew the risks that flying presented. He joked about his wife’s opposition to his purchasing the plane in a video that had been posted to YouTube by ICON but that was removed shortly after the crash.
“She’s fought me the whole way,” Halladay said of his wife, Brandy.
“Hard,” Brandy Halladay said in the video. “I fought hard, I was very against it.” She conceded after flying in the plane, though, that she understood the appeal.
Piloting small planes has long been popular among athletes, and Major League Baseball has lost other athletes to similar crashes. Thurman Munson, an All-Star catcher and the 10th captain of the Yankees, died after crashing a Cessna Citation in 1979. And Cory Lidle, a former teammate of Halladay’s on the 2003 Blue Jays, died in 2006 when a Cirrus SR20 he was flying with a co-pilot crashed into an apartment building on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.
The fact that the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office led Tuesday’s recovery effort carried extra emotion because of Halladay’s personal relationship with the department, which included the donation of a police dog that the department named Doc, in reference to Halladay’s nickname.
“You wouldn’t know what Roy did because Roy wouldn’t tell you what he did,” Nocco said. “And that’s the legacy of a great man.”
Halladay is survived by his wife and two sons, Ryan and Braden.

"As the latest reports indicate, USAA who ousted ads from Sean Hannity’s Fox News Show this previous week has announced that they will bring the ads back.
As reported by APNews, the USAA financial services firm is bringing back the advertising on Sean Hannity’s Fox News Channel program after getting vocally bashed for its first decision, from the bulk of the military members and veterans that it works for.
The San Antonio, Texas-based company stated Tuesday, that it will also begin advertising again on other programs where it had dropped ads, in which “Hardball” and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC, and Jake Tapper’s “The Lead” on CNN.
After Hannity’s reporting on an almost forgotten conspiracy theory regarding the death of a Democratic National Committee staff member, the liberal advocacy group Media Matters this past week posted a list of his show’s advertisers — and USAA was one of the 10 who declared they are dropping the ads. Back then, the USAA stated the company’s policy was to stand aside from politically oriented shows.
However, many of USAA’s customers were immediately triggered, and all of that was topped off with the announcement that the company is advertising on different opinion shows.
“We heard concerns from many members who watch and listen to these programs,” USAA said in a statement on Tuesday. “Our goal in advertising has always been to reach members of the military community who would benefit from USAA’s well-known commitment to service. Today, the lines between news and editorial are increasingly blurred.”
Brent Bozell, president of the conservative Media Research Center, stated he wasn’t shocked by USAA’s move, “given the avalanche” of protests. His group was responsible for the conceptualization of that backlash, and stated its members gathered no less than 1,600 phone calls to USAA in the span of 48 hours.
“They did the right think in going back on that show,” he stated, “and so long as the other side isn’t participating in personal smears, they should participate on those shows, too.”

"For years Bill O’Reilly has been a behemoth at Fox News. His O’Reilly Factor has dominated the cable news ratings and, while he’s always been a blowhard, he’s done more than his share to promote the conservative agenda in this country.
Well, it looks like things that have gotten bad for O’Reilly are about to get worse. After a recent New York Times article revealed that Fox News has paid out over $13 million to women who complained about O’Reilly either harassing or making unwanted sexual advances at them, many advertisers are requesting that Fox not air their ads on his program.
Mercedes, Allstate, Constant Contact, Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, T. Rowe Price, BMW, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, and Untuckit, with probably many more to follow.
It’s hard to tell what’s true here or not since Bill has a huge target on his back as a leading conservative voice.
O’Reilly’s program has been the most-watched program in the cable news landscape for 14 years, recently clocking its highest-rated quarter ever. O’Reilly has denied all allegations against him.
The advertiser pullout is becoming increasingly problematic for FNC’s mother company because when Fox News chairman and CEO Roger Ailes exited last summer in a hail of sexual harassment allegations, parent 21st Century Fox had pledged zero tolerance for any behavior that “disrespects women or contributes to an uncomfortable work environment.” The company recently re-upped O’Reilly’s contract and, NYT reports, some of the payments were made since Ailes’ exit.
On Monday, when the NYT story got snatched up by other media outlets, Lexus told CNN of it’s Factor ads that it seeks “to partner with organizations who share our company culture and philosophy of respect for all people,” adding, “We will continue to monitor the situation and will take any appropriate action through our media buying partners.”
Tuesday, however, Lexus told Deadline in a statement:  “We take our duties as a responsible advertiser seriously and have been closely monitoring the situation involving The O’Reilly Factor. In response, we have asked our media-buying partners to move all Lexus ad inventory out of the program.”
Insurance company Allstate also has suspended its advertising because, the company said in a statement, “we are concerned about the issues surrounding the program.”
Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, parent company of Rachael Ray-endorsed dog food brand Nutrish, said Tuesday afternoon it “removed our advertising from the program because of these recent and disturbing allegations,” according to FNC competitor CNN, which contacted 20 companies that advertise on O’Reilly’s program after the NYT report published.
Untuckit, which reports about two-thirds of its employees are women, instructed its media buyer Tuesday morning to reallocate its ad dollars to other shows, effective immediately, calling it “the right decision at this time.”
Digital marketing company Constant Contact said it pulled its ads from Factor, though it might have happened too late to effect the change in time for Tuesday night’s telecast.
Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and asset management firm T. Rowe Price have added their names to the list of exiting companies.
Consumer healthcare company Sanofi said it’s scrubbed its ads too, but added, “We do not endorse the behavior or opinions of program hosts or the content” on shows in which it advertisers.
Angie’s List similarly said it does not endorse viewpoints of the “wide spectrum” of programs in which it advertises. But Angie’s List, unlike Sanofi, said that, for that reason, it has no plans to pull out of Factor, explaining in its statement, “Just as we trust members to make their own hiring decisions, we trust them to make their own media consumption decisions.”
BMW reported early Tuesday it had suspended its ads. And Hyundai said it preemptively pulled plans to run ads on the program, though it was not currently advertising on the program, CNN reported Tuesday morning.
And, you won’t see Mercedes-Benz ads on The O’Reilly Factor for a while after NYT reported five women had received payouts and, in return, agreed not to pursue litigation or talk about their accusations.
The car company said its ads had been “reassigned,” calling the NYT allegations “disturbing.”
In its statement, Mercedes noted it runs ads on “most major cable news shows,” without explaining why that is relevant. “Given the importance of women in every aspect of our business, we don’t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now,” the company said.
There had been no press reports about advertisers pulling spots from FNC when Ailes suddenly left the company last summer.
Jenny Craig, meanwhile, told CNN Monday it “condemns any and all forms of sexual harassment,” but that “as a matter of corporate policy, we do not publicly comment on our advertising strategy” – except, that is, to say, “we are constantly evaluating our media buys to maximize the efficiency of our corporate investment and effectively reach our target audience.”
Loads more where that came from.
CNN also reported getting a number “looking into the matter” responses from various Factor advertisers Monday.
Whether these allegations are true or not, it’s going to be hard to stop an advertiser exodus once it starts, and it looks like an uphill battle for O’Reilly going forward.",1

"A key ally of Rupert Murdoch has sold his stake in 21st Century Fox, leaving the company more vulnerable to a rebellion by shareholders unhappy at the dominance of the Murdoch family.
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who controls the investment firm Kingdom Holding and is one of the world’s richest men, at one stage owned more than 6% of Fox and has consistently backed the Murdochs in shareholder votes about the family’s control of the company.
He has been a shareholder in Murdoch companies – including Fox and News Corp, the owner of the Sun, Times and Wall Street Journal – for two decades and expressed public support for the family after the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World in 2011.
Regulatory filings in New York show Prince Alwaleed reduced his stake to 4.98% in December 2015, and an analysis of Bloomberg data shows the stake has fallen to zero since the end of the last financial quarter, on 30 September.
It is not clear why he sold the stake or to whom. The sale represents the loss of an ally for the Murdochs and adds an extra twist to reports this week that Fox held talks with Disney about selling most of the company.
The Murdochs control about 39% of the voting rights in Fox, giving them control of the key decisions, but own only about 17% of the shares.
Fox is run by Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James, the latter of whom is chief executive. The company is trying to buy the 39% of Sky that it does not own in an 11.7bn deal, but the deal is being investigated by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority on the grounds of media plurality and commitment to broadcasting standards.
Fox’s proposed takeover of Sky suffered another setback this week when the media regulator Ofcom ruled that two Fox News programmes that discussed the Manchester Arena bombing and Donald Trump’s travel ban breached UK broadcasting standards.
On Wednesday night Fox reported better than expected quarterly results, with its cable assets helping the company beat analysts’ expectations. The company reported revenues of $7bn (5.3bn) for the three months ending 30 September 2017.
The Murdochs declined to comment on the Sky deal beyond any already published statements but said they remained confident the deal would be completed by the middle of 2018.
Lachlan Murdoch, the executive co-chair of 21st Century Fox, also said the company would also not comment on any talks with Disney. But he dismissed speculation that the Murdochs had decided Fox lacked the scale to compete with rivals including Amazon, Google and Netflix, which has been seen as one of the prime reasons the company might consider a sale.
“Fox has the required scale,” Murdoch said. “We are excited about all our brands and the opportunities they offer the company.”
Fox is facing a rebellion at its annual meeting next Thursday from shareholders who are unhappy with the company’s performance and how it handled a sexual harassment scandal at Fox News. The Nathan Cummings Foundation, a small Fox shareholder, has tabled a proposal to eliminate the shareholding structure that allows the Murdochs to control the company despite their limited shareholding.
The foundation has been pushing for change at Fox and News Corp for several years. Fox has recommended that shareholders oppose the motion.
CtW Investment Group, which represents pension funds, wrote to Fox last month calling for an overhaul of the board, including the departure of Sir Rod Eddington as a non-executive and the replacement of “insiders” with independent directors.
It also called for the creation of a corporation responsibility and compliance committee and said the board of Fox had been slow to respond to the scandal at Fox News, which led to the departure of the channel’s boss, Roger Ailes – who has since died – and the presenter Bill O’Reilly.
The CtW letter said: “The board stands at a critical juncture. The cultural crisis that has been exposed over the last 15 months at Fox News is a clear illustration of corporate control problem at 21st Century Fox. We would like to see the board take steps to minimise the risk of such a crisis in the future.
“We sincerely believe these governance changes are critical to ward off future corporate crises at Fox.”
Fox declined to comment. Kingdom Holding did not respond to a request for comment.

"The Democratic Party is pushing for a federal $15 minimum wage as partof itsrecently revealed “Better Deal” economic platform, despite paying itsown field organizers significantly less than thatduring the 2016 election cycle.
The newplatform, announcedMonday at a press conference in Berryville, Va., aims to ingratiate the Democratic Party with blue collar voters through populist economic messaging focused on prioritizing the interests of workers over those of corporate interests.
However, thesame party pushing the dubious $15 minimum wage chose not to implementthe policy itselfduring the 2016 election.
A group of roughly 40field workers filed a class action lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and six state party organizations in May, alleging that they were not fairly compensated for their work during the 2016 campaign. The field organizers claim to have been paid $3,000 per month while consistently working 80 to 90 hours per week.
Justin Swidler, the attorney representing the workers, described their treatment as “obscene.”
“These workers were out there in a campaign that was promising $15 an hour minimum wage, and expanding the overtime rights of workers,” Swidlertold CBS News. Swidler did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.
The DNC’s decision to givethe executive director a $300,000 bonus after the failed election cycle exacerbated workers’ complaints, as their wages were leftwell short of $15 per hour.
Democratic leadership elected to include the federal $15 minimum wage as part of their economic agenda in the face of their own real world experience as employers, as well as overwhelming externalevidenceindicating that the policy has harmed low wage workers and small businessesinAmerican cities that have tried it.
A Heritage Foundationstudyfound that, if the Democrats take the $15 minimum wage policy nationwide, it would eliminate 7million jobs.
Ironically,the federal $15 minimum wage would likelymost severelyharm the very people the Democrats are trying to reach in time for the 2018 midterm elections: blue collar, rural voters.
“Why? Because they cost consumers more than they provide in benefits to workers, even when the workers don’t lose their jobs. Consumers pay higher prices due to minimum wage increases. But the gain received by workers is partly offset by the tax code,” Bader said.

Hi Ben,
Let's start here:

In the above links you are posting classified collateral account bonds and then you are soliciting gold be used from the collateral accounts via the P2 Freemason Lodge, out of Italy I believe, to finance operations for the White Dragon Society. Both actions are illegal. This is no different than Henry Kissinger going to Russia and talking to Putin pretending to be the sole signatory of the collateral accounts, when there is no doubt Putin knows the game Kissinger is attempting. Or when he coerces the Emperor of Japan to ""sign off"" on bonds.
This needs to stop.
The P2 Freemason Lodge, Henry Kissinger and the White Dragon Society needs to stop all their operations against the collateral accounts, including making claims in regards to the collateral accounts in any capacity and ALL assets belonging to the collateral accounts need to be immediately returned.
Feel free to send this email to the parties mentioned above and I welcome them or yourself to contact me because the last I heard David Crayford and American Lawyer were not happy campers.
BF Reply:
The link you provided does not show the WDS making claims to the gold. I am reporting what the Vatican P2 lodge was trying to do. The financial instrument pictured there is in the possession of the P2 and it was them who made their images public. I did suggest to them that if there was so much gold that they needed to provide proof that it actually exists and they could do that by actually physically producing some for neutral third parties to see.
The WDS has proposed setting up a meritocratically staffed future planning agency to plan humanity's future but it does not claim ownership of the global collateral accounts and never has. Furthermore the WDS has no interest in running this future planning agency or claiming ownership to any funds put at its disposal. At this point though, we are giving up on these accounts and moving to crypto-currencies backed by real world assets in no way linked to these probably mythical accounts.
By the way, there is a fake White Dragon Society home page that has nothing to do with us. We are mostly an analogue organization working in the real world because the digital world has been too compromised to be trusted. The WDS supports democracy, meritocracy, freedom of speech, the rule of law and human rights. Our membership is mostly Western but we do not believe in artificial East/West/North/South divides. We are all human beings from the planet earth.",1
"When Donald Trump won the election in 2016, it sent shockwaves through the American left. After months of downplaying his chances to win, Trump dealt liberals and their media allies a stunning defeat. Although the warning signs were always there, the liberal echo chamber refused to see them.
How could such a stunning defeat happen? It would seem liberals have firm control over the nation’s media. Not only did mainstream news sources give Trump endless negative coverage, but popular Hollywood stars and musicians dependably parrot left-wing talking points. Turn on late-night TV, and you’ll find a host of comedians bashing conservatives.
However, the internet age gives Americans access to more sources of information than they have ever had. Not trusting America’s media giants, millions have turned to alternative sources of news to get a more balanced point of view. Without firm control of the narrative, liberals underestimated Trump’s chances of victory.
Of course, the left didn’t take this threat to their monopoly on information lightly. Shortly after the results were in, the media set its sights on alternative news outlets. Branding such outlets as “fake news”, liberals tried to undermine America’s trust in alternative news.
Sadly, liberals have a powerful ally in their crusade against alternative news. America’s tech giants like Facebook, Google, and YouTube are also bastions of liberal politics. Knowing their platforms are vital to alternative news outlets, many tech companies have begun suppressing conservative views. If they couldn’t win the argument, why not censor it?
Facebook was the first to pioneer this strategy, routinelysuppressing conservative news from users feeds. Google got in on the act too,cutting off conservative news outlets from its powerful advertising network. Now it seems as if YouTube is the next domino to fall.
Two of President Trump’s most ardent supporters, the YouTube stars known as Diamond and Silk, say a financial stranglehold has been placed on their videos.
Lynnette Hardway and Rochelle Richardson of North Carolina, whose support of Mr. Trump and no-nonsense delivery during the 2016 U. S. presidential season turned them into online sensations, said Thursday their YouTube videos have become casualties of the company’sattemptto silence “extremism.”
[emailprotected] @TeamYouTube stopped over 95% percent of ourvideosfrom being monetized, stating: ‘It’s Not Suitable For All Advertisers,’” the two said in a series of tweets. “Wonder if @YouTube @TeamYouTube stopped the monetization of our videos because we are loyal supporters of the @POTUS. Hummmm. Sounds like Censorship to us, which is a Violation of our First Amendment. A Bias Method used to Silence our Conservative Voices. @YouTube, how was it OK to monetize our videos for the past two years and now those same videos are no longer eligible for monetization?”
Predictably, YouTube claims it is only trying to fight “extremism”:
News of the largely demonetized channel comes less than two weeks since the company announced plans to fight inappropriate content.
“We’ll soon be applying tougher treatment to videos that aren’t illegal but have been flagged by users as potential violations of our policies on hate speech and violent extremism,” the company announced Aug. 1 on its official blog. “If we find that these videos don’t violate our policies but contain controversial religious or supremacist content, they will be placed in a limited state. The videos will remain on YouTube behind an interstitial, won’t be recommended, won’t be monetized, and won’t have key features including comments, suggested videos, and likes.”
The problem, of course, is that liberals label mainstream conservative thought as “extremist” and “bigoted”. As such, they are able to justify their actions as simply fighting extremism. However, what they are really doing is silencing the opposition.
Clearly, the left is trying to maintain its monopoly on information. With the powerful tech companies on their side, conservatives are in real danger of being squeezed out of the debate.",1

"Here’s a word of advice for companies in trouble: Don’t make the public any angrier than necessary. That’s the mistake Equifax Inc. repeated several times over in its careless handling of its careless loss of detailed identifying data on 143 million consumers, a breach widely described as the worst in history. The company made a number of missteps, such as taking months to make the break-in public, and apparently running web server software with a known vulnerability.
But the biggest question since the news broke has involved whether Equifax was trying to pull a fast one: Were worried consumers being forced to surrender their right to sue before they could find out if they were among the victims of the hack, or was that an urban myth? I’ve been teaching contract law for a quarter of a century, and I’m not entirely sure.
The issue arose after some people actually read the boilerplate on the special site Equifax set up so that worried consumers could find out whether their data was in the wind.
The readers discovered -- or at least thought they discovered -- that consumers who clicked on “I agree” were giving up their right to sue the company over the hack, and consenting to arbitration instead. Social media erupted with fury.
Unlike most contracts professors, I am no great enemy of arbitration clauses, and I consider the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s jeremiad against them to be ill-conceived. I also have no particular problem with what are sometimes derided as “adhesive contracts,” where consumers are asked to consent to a bunch of boilerplate they rarely read. (In short words, such contracts solve serious agency problems and lower transaction costs, enabling the consumer economy to function more cheaply.) But I have a big problem with a company trying to sneak things past panicked consumers, particularly when the panic is caused by the company’s own malfeasance. Sometimes an example has to be made.
Here, however, we come to the nub. Was Equifax really trying to pull a fast one? After getting spanked on Twitter and Facebook, taking its lumps in the tech press, and being threatened by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, the company added some hastily drafted language to its frequently asked questions page, insisting that the ban on lawsuits does not apply to what it cagily called “the cybersecurity incident.”
That might have been the end of the matter, if anyone actually believed that FAQs were legally binding,or if a subsequent change in the FAQs could affect the status of consumers who had already clicked “I agree” before the new language showed up. So the effect of the clarification was to sow more confusion.
Over the weekend, Equifax issued a series of written statements in an effort to assure the world that “enrolling in the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products that we are offering as part of this cybersecurity incident does not prohibit consumers from taking legal action.” The company went on to clarify its clarification: “We will not apply any arbitration clause or class action waiver against consumers for claims related to the free products offered in response to the cybersecurity incident or for claims related to the cybersecurity incident itself.” Backed into a corner, Equifax finally removed the language about arbitration from the terms of use on the site.
In the showdown between a big company and social media, the big company blinked.
But was Equifax really guilty of what its critics claimed? I’m not sure that the company was guilty of anything except more sloppiness. From the time the site went up, consumers have been able to check whether their information has been “impacted” (as the site puts it) without clicking an “I agree” box.
The controversial terms of service apply only after a consumer chooses to enroll in the one-year free credit monitoring service that Equifax is providing.
This isn’t a change Equifax made in response to the furor; this is how the site originally functioned.
Still, plenty of ambiguity lingered. One could read the terms of service to say, in effect, “You don’t have to agree not to sue over our loss of your data in order to find out whether your data was lost. But if you sign up for the free services we’re offering, you give up your right to sue not only if we mess up in monitoring your credit but also over our original loss of your data.” That’s not the most natural reading of the language, but it’s plausible. So maybe there was a problem after all. Although courts usually resolve contract ambiguities against the party who drafted the language, you never know what a particular judge will do. That’s why it’s good for everybody that the company has backed down.
But what a series of missteps! Maybe the anti-lawsuit language was indeed an effort by Equifax to pull a fast one; maybe it was the byproduct of unthinking reproduction of boilerplate from elsewhere. Either way, the company was let down badly by both its lawyers and its corporate communications staff. Which leads us to the final lesson from the whole mess: If you’re going to wait months to confess what you’ve allowed to happen, spend a big chunk of that time working out the tiniest details of the fix. Long before social media existed, the demons were in the details. And it’s those demons that will come back and bite you in the end.

If FOX News had made a conscious decision one year ago to turn away their loyal viewers, they could not have done a better job at it than they have.

Allowing Kelly to leave for “greener pastures”may have been their one smart move.

"Leading members of the establishment mediaare ignoring the months-long House IT scandal rocking congressional Democrats, even after theFBI’sinvestigation into the matter became public, and even after Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s top IT aide was arrested trying to flee to Pakistan after wiring almost $300,000 to the country.
As of Thursday morning, both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have yet to report onthe growing scandal surrounding several IT staffers employedby House Democrats, including Wasserman Schultz’s top IT aide, Imran Awan.
Other establishment media outlets are similarly refusing to tell the public about the growing scandal. MSNBC has given zero on-air coverage to the scandal. ABC News and NBC News’ national broadcasts have similarly given zero coverage to the scandal. CNN’s only on-air coverage of the scandal so far was a brief mention during the 6a.m. ET hour Thursday.
As reported by The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Luke Rosiak — who for months has extensively covered the growing scandal — Awan was arrested on Monday as he attempted to flee the country to Pakistan after wiring almost $300,000 to the country. The FBI seized smashed hard drives from Awan’s homeas part of the ongoing investigation. (RELATED:FBI Seized Smashed Hard Drives From Wasserman Schultz IT Aide’s Home)
The Pakistani-born Awan attempted to flee the country shortly after Rosiak’s report that he was the subject of an FBI investigation. Awan’s wife, who was also on congressional Democrats’ payroll, previously fled to Pakistan,as first reported by Rosiak.
Awan and members of his family received $4 million from the Democratic congressmen they were working for since 2010. Wasserman Schultz has been especially uncooperative with the probe into her staffers and eventhreatened the Capitol Police chief for gathering evidence. She refused to fire Awanuntil after he was arrested, even though Capitol Police had already revoked the Awans’ access to the congressional IT system in February 2017 in relation toa major security breach.
Current House IT aidsfear the suspects are blackmailingDemocratic members of Congress with their own data, based on the Democratic members’ inexplicable loyalty to the House IT staffers involved in the probe.
Despite the growing scandal, theestablishment media has for months done its best to keep the public in the dark. That trend continued this week, even after Rosiak reported the existence of the FBI investigation, and even after Awan — a top Democratic staffer — was arrested trying to flee the country to Pakistan.(RELATED:House Dem IT Suspects Wanted Untraceable Payments — And Sure Enough, Millions Disappeared)
The Washington Post — whose motto is “Democracy dies in darkness” — kept its readers in the dark for months about the growing scandal. The Post publishedits first articleon the House IT scandal Wednesday afternoon, noting Awan’s arrest for bank fraud.
For comparison, Rosiak has written more than 20 news stories on thescandal.

"Ex Fox News host Bill O’Reilly regrets the fact he didn’t fight back against those who successfully tried to undermine and make him lose his lifelong job at Fox News.
Namely, O’Reilly stated he should have shown some resistance against those imposing their intentions on his advertisers, same as his friend Sean Hannity did, who not too long ago also had liberal activists push his advertisers toward ousting him.
O’Reilly made the remarks at a time of an interview with Newsmax TV on Thursday.
“In hindsight, Sean did it the right way,” O’Reilly stated. “I should’ve done it that way, but I didn’t.”
“This was no accident our sponsors were attacked. This is very well organized. They tried to with Hannity. Hannity actually fought back. I didn’t. I should have. For reasons that I cannot explain now, I did not,” O’Reilly elaborated.
“Hannity knows they’re looking to get him,” the conservative commentator continued. “He said it. But I admire Sean, and I admire how he handled situation, because he brought it directly to the folks and the sponsors stopped. He lost a few, but they stopped. So, he was successful in fighting off the attack.”
“But there will be more,” O’Reilly said.
“We have a lot of information, but my lawyers are begging me not to say anything,” he stated. “We’re going to drop it in the next few weeks, and it’s really, really stunning how organized that was and what these people did.”
“I want to let the legal people handle this. I do believe there will be litigation, so I’m going to let them take the lead and then after it’s out, then I’ll comment further on it,” O’Reilly elaborated.
“That was the goal, and that was instituted very quickly once the president was elected,” O’Reilly stated. “So, ‘we got to get the Fox News Channel and how we’re going to get them? Got to take their talent out. Get the talent that matters.’”
“And so they were very powerful people, very well-funded people who got together and advised various ways,” he elaborated.

"Holly Williams is a CBS News Foreign Correspondent based in Istanbul, Turkey. She joined CBS News in July 2012, and has more than 15 years of experience covering major news events and international conflicts across Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
Williams, who is fluent in Mandarin, received the George Polk Award in 2012 for her reporting on Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng, after he escaped house arrest and fled to the U. S. Embassy in Beijing. She was the first reporter to reach his village -- evading government security guards -- where other members of his family were being harassed by the Chinese authorities.
In 2015, Williams received the Edward R. Murrow award for her continuing coverage of ISIS, and the Jack R. Howard Award from the Scripps Howard Foundation for her early reporting on ISIS in Syria and northern Iraq.
Williams was the first network correspondent in Iraq to report on the emergence of ISIS in the country's north in the summer of 2014. She has continued to cover ISIS across the region, including the battle for Tikrit, the discovery of mass graves in western Iraq, and the militants' advance in Libya.
Williams has also covered Syria's civil war from inside the country, where she and her team gained access to a prison where alleged ISIS terrorists were being held, and interviewed female Kurdish fighters on the frontline.
Williams' international reportage includes the downfall of the Russian-backed government in Kiev; the search for missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370; the Israel-Gaza conflict; the uprisings in Egypt after the military removed former President Mohammed Morsi from office; and the Nepal earthquake. She also provided rare reporting from Saudi Arabia, and interviewed women who have been punished for demanding the right to drive.
Williams has distinguished herself as an international investigative reporter. In 2013, she went undercover inside a Bangladesh factory that exports clothing and other garments to U. S. and European retailers where she discovered safety and labor violations. She posed as an ivory buyer to report on the global trafficking of illegal ivory from Africa to China, and investigated the use of the US Government-funded ""dark net"" by pedophiles.
Before joining CBS News, Williams was a Beijing-based Asia Correspondent for Sky News, covering the Japanese tsunami and nuclear disaster and the release of Burmese Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.
Prior to that, she was a producer for both BBC News and Sky News. She produced stories that won the Royal Television Society Award, the Foreign Press Association Award and the Golden Nymph.

"The acting head of the Transportation Security Administration was reassigned Monday after an internal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security found security failures at dozens of the nation's busiest airports. The breaches allowed undercover investigators to smuggle weapons, fake explosives and other contraband through numerous checkpoints.
Melvin Carraway, an 11-year veteran of the TSA who became acting administrator in January, was immediately reassigned to a DHS program coordinating with local law enforcement agencies, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Monday night. Coast Guard Vice Adm. Pete Neffenger's nomination to be permanent administrator is awaiting Senate confirmation.
Upon learning the initial findings of the Office of Inspector General's report, Johnson immediately directed TSA to implement a series of other actions, several of which are now in place, agency officials said.
In one case, an alarm sounded, but even during a pat-down, the screening officer failed to detect a fake plastic explosive taped to an undercover agent's back. In all, so-called ""Red Teams"" of Homeland Security agents posing as passengers were able get weapons past TSA agents in 67 out of 70 tests — a 95 percent failure rate, according to agency officials.
""The numbers in these reports never look good out of context, but they are a critical element in the continual evolution of our aviation security,"" Homeland Security officials said in a statement.
This isn't the first time TSA officers have failed to detect fake terrorists and their weapons. ""Red Teams"" have been probing TSA checkpoints for 13 years, oftentimes successfully getting weapons past airport screeners.
However, this time, TSA agents failed to detect almost every single test bomb and gun, aviation experts said.
""It's disturbing news. The question is how we can best mitigate that vulnerability in a way that doesn't prohibit the free movement of people and goods,"" John Pistole, a former TSA administrator, told NBC News. ""That's just something that there's no perfect answer for.""
Meanwhile, terrorism experts stress that the threat levels remain high.
""There's a continuing drumbeat of interests by terrorist groups, whether al-Qaeda or al-Qaeda affiliates, to try to bring down a Western — especially a U. S.-bound — aircraft,"" Pistole said.",0

Like the New Orleans Saints after Hurricane Katrina or the Red Sox after the Boston Marathon bombing, the Houston Astros played for their devastated city following Hurricane Harvey, and clinched their first World Series title in franchise history on Nov. 1. (Taylor Turner/The Washington Post)      When the management of the Astros needed someone to stand near home plate and speak to the crowd at Houston’s Minute Maid Stadium on the afternoon of Sept. 2, before the team’s first home game since Hurricane Harvey made landfall and ravaged the region, the choice was obvious. A few minutes before first pitch, A. J. Hinch, the manager with an uncommon gift for connecting with people, took the microphone and after a short pause told his fellow Houstonians, “It’s good to be home.” The speech, short and heartfelt, ended: “Stay strong. Be strong.” “We needed someone to come out and address the crowd, and I started thinking, ‘Who is the best person to connect the players to the fans?’ It was clearly A.J.,” Astros President Reid Ryan said. “He nailed it.” On Thursday, when Hinch and the Astros returned again to Houston for the final time in 2017 – two months to the day since their emotional return after Harvey -- they were bringing the World Series trophy with them. With a 5-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday at Dodger Stadium, in Game 7 of the World Series, the Astros secured the first championship in the franchise’s history and fulfilled their promise to their wounded city.  They never promised a championship. But they promised to play as hard as they could, for as long as they could, in order to try to make it happen. And on that count, they delivered. Facing elimination for the third time in two weeks, the Astros staved it off for the third time, and this time it made them champions. And as they screamed and danced and sprayed champagne late Wednesday, a celebration for themselves and their teammates, they felt an immeasurable sense of pride in delivering a title to Houston.   Minute Maid Park in Houston erupted in cheers and tears as the Astros won their first World Series. (Reuters)   “That word on our chest means a lot,” said center fielder George Springer, the World Series MVP, standing on a stage at the center of Dodger Stadium’s infield, with HOUSTON on his chest, “means a lot to us.” The Astros’ march to the title was remarkable in many ways. In an era of unprecedented home run and strikeout rates, the Astros’ exceptional offense managed the rare feat of leading the majors in slugging percentage while striking out at the lowest rate. In the playoffs, they conquered the teams with the three largest payrolls in the game – the Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees and the Dodgers. They fulfilled the cover-story prophecy of a 2014 issue of Sports Illustrated, which, near the middle of what would become a 92-loss season, proclaimed the Astros “Your 2017 World Series Champs.”  They also validated one of the most extreme tank-jobs the sport has ever seen – deeper than even that of the 2016 champion Chicago Cubs -- a four-year stretch from 2011-14 in which they traded veterans, shed payroll and lost an average of 104 games. They also hoarded the resulting high draft picks from all that losing – draft picks that helped form the youthful core of the 2017 champs: Carlos Correa, Lance McCuller Jr. and Alex Bregman, as well as the trade chips that brought them ace Justin Verlander this August.  Others, such as Springer and all-star second baseman Jose Altuve, the likely American League most valuable player this year, pre-date the tanking era. And still others, such as veterans Brian McCann, Carlos Beltran and Verlander, came at later stages of the rebuild, as the Astros added pieces to push themselves over the top. “As a baseball fan,” said McCann, a catcher in his 13th big league season, “the view I get and the talent I get to watch every night – we’re going to look back in five, 10, 15 years and it’s gonna be, ‘I can’t believe all those guys were on the same team.’ That’s the kind of talent I got to witness every night.” Someday in the future, the ascension of the 2017 Astros may be remembered as the moment the analytics movement conquered the game for good. While other teams with a clear analytical bent have won titles in the past, none did so with the same aggressiveness and thoroughness and the same all-encompassing, top-down embrace of the Astros – starting with General Manager Jeff Luhnow, who holds degrees in engineering from Penn and business administration from Northwestern, and filtering down through the organization. “Our game has evolved to the point to where everyone has to choose to what extent they apply” analytics, Hinch said. “We all have them -- really smart people that are working behind the scenes to provide that kind of information. How you use them is going to be the competitive advantage. If we think we have different ways to maximize performance, we’re going to use them.”   Manager A.J. Hinch is likely inspiring other hires around the league. (Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)  There are many examples of how the Astros turned their analytical edge into wins on their march to a title – they were so good at it, a St. Louis Cardinals employee was banned from the game and arrested for hacking into the Astros’ computer systems in a quest to learn their secrets -- but perhaps none exemplifies it more than pitcher Charlie Morton.  A year ago, Morton was kicked to the curb by the Philadelphia Phillies at the end of an injury-plagued campaign in which he made just four starts. By that point, he was nearing 33 and had already endured surgeries to both hips, his hamstring and his pitching elbow. He figured he might spend the rest of his career scrounging for stray jobs. But the denizens of the Astros’ self-described “Nerd Cave” had noticed the uptick in Morton’s velocity in 2016 and had noticed that the spin rate on his curve was among the highest in the sport. There were enough raw materials to work with, and the Astros signed him to a two-year, $14 million contract – a move that raised eyebrows at the time, given Morton’s career 46-71 record and 4.54 ERA at the time -- and went to work refining his pitches. “The more you dug into him,” Hinch said, “the more you realized that the weapons were there.” The day after Morton signed with the Astros, Hinch took him out for breakfast. And this fall, Morton was the winning pitcher in both Game 7 of the ALCS and Game 7 of the World Series, the first pitcher ever to achieve that double honor. On Wednesday night, four nights after starting Game 4, he closed out the Astros’ championship with four dominant innings of relief. “It’s part of a journey,” Morton said. “And the highs and lows are what make it great, not just the highs. If anything, the lows make you appreciate it more. They make you a better person. They make you a better pitcher, a better professional in general.” Read that quote again. It shows something important about the Astros. If you had watched them all month and never knew anything about their deep analytics bent, what would strike you most of all about them – well, besides the breathtaking talent – is the deep sense of humanity they all seem to possess, from Morton’s self-discovery to Beltran’s quiet leadership to Altuve’s infectious joy to Springer’s profound grasp of this team’s role in its city’s recovery. Without question, that unquantifiable quality had a role in the Astros’ success, and even the nerds understood a championship team needed that quality up and down its roster. It wasn’t necessarily measurable, but it was discoverable and acquirable. “It would be foolish to think that, because you can’t quantify it, it doesn’t matter,” said Sig Mejdal, standing alone off to the side of the Astros’ on-field celebration on the Dodger Stadium infield late Wednesday night. Mejdal was Luhnow’s first hire after getting the GM job in Houston. A former engineer for NASA and Lockheed Martin with multiple engineering degrees and another in cognitive psychology, Mejdal took on the job title of Astros “director of decision sciences” – a title that, one supposes, probably didn’t exist in Branch Rickey’s day. Asked how a front office built around quantitative analysis sought and found players with the impeccable makeup of these 2017 Astros, he said, “You rely on your experts. You rely on the coaching staff. So not only do you have the [player’s] quantifiable stuff, you have their reputation. You have our staff members’ best guesses of how he’s going to fit in, what he’s going to bring beyond the singles and doubles.” At the center of it all is Hinch, the perfect bridge between the front office and the players. A 43-year-old Stanford grad with a degree in psychology, he is the prototype of the modern manager – the kind sweeping the game now: young, warm, smart, approachable, open to new ideas and free of the sort of ego and experience that might make a more old-school manager bristle at the intrusion of the front office into the on-field decision-making process. “He’s ideal,” Mejdal said. “He’s wonderful. He’s a critical-thinking, open-minded manager who is incessantly trying to improve. And what more can you hope for?” In a sense, Hinch is the conduit between the Astros’ brain and its heart. He and his staff receive the vast reams of information the front office provides and parcels it out to the players based on how much they want, how much they need and how much they can handle. And he manages to do so without making any of them feel like the sum of their cold, hard numbers. “The job has changed,” said Ryan, the team president. “Now you have to be able to manage up, to ownership and the GM, and manage down, to the players. The manager becomes the link between what an advanced analytical front office is doing and making sure the players are able to be themselves, not be overwhelmed by the information, and at the same time relay those messages.” As Hinch said, “My job is to tie it all together and make it work … We believe in people. We believe in scouting. We also are forward thinking in gathering and using information. But we do understand and appreciate the human element.” If the managerial moves of the past month or so across the game are any indication, plenty of teams are looking at Houston’s Hinch – and his good friend and World Series counterpart, Dave Roberts of the Dodgers, who has many of the same qualities – as their models for recent hires. In recent weeks, the Boston Red Sox (Alex Cora, Hinch’s bench coach in Houston), Washington Nationals (Dave Martinez), New York Mets (Mickey Callaway) and Philadelphia Phillies (Gabe Kapler) all hired managers with similar traits as Hinch and Roberts, and all of them replaced veteran managers who were considerably older. “You can win in this sport in a lot of different ways,” Hinch said. “I think too often we chase what the last guy did. We saw what made Chicago and Cleveland successful last year, and so we’re compared to how we run our bullpens based on how they did it … There are some traditional values that are always going to be in our game. There’s progressive growth that can always happen in this game. If you subscribe too much to either, you’re probably going to miss a lot of content that can help you win.” The Astros won it all this year in their own, inimitable way. Few franchises might have the stomach for the extreme tank job the Astros pulled off earlier this decade. Others might not be ready, despite its encroaching influence, to rely so heavy on brains. But every great team has a thriving heart, and even if the Astros can’t measure that, they are as good as or better than everyone else in recognizing it.

"Will it be R. I.P. for China's VPNs? On Monday, Bloomberg News reported that the Chinese government had ordered telecommunications providers to block access to individual virtual private networksby Feb. 1. VPNs are popular and widely utilized services that allow internet users to bypass web restrictions. In effect, the new rules would block the most popular means for Chinese netizensto see beyond the so-called Great Firewall.
The Chinese government has been moving in this direction for a long time. But, up until this year, it seemed to have struck an uneasy balance between its desire to control information and the desires of its most educated and cosmopolitan citizens to engage with the rest of the world online. A VPN ban would both upsetthat balance and endanger several prized government initiatives designed to foster a more innovative Chinese economy. While there's little doubt the government can get its way, the costs could be higher than officials expect.
China's always had a complicated relationship with the internet. In the 1990s, President Jiang Zemin was an enthusiastic proponent of the technology and the free flow of information, even as his government began a hugely expensive, multiyear project to control the digital realm. That effort evolved into the Great Firewall; its initial targets were foreign news sites and bulletin boards where sentiments perceived as contrary to Communist Party interests were posted. In the past decade, the list has expanded to social media sites, including Twitter and Facebook, foreign search engines and media outlets, andphoto-sharing sites.
For most Chinese, not having access to Facebook, Google and the Wall Street Journal -- all blocked sites -- isn't a major concern. Chinese companies have developed robust alternatives to many Western online services, while news stories of interest to Chinese will usually make their way onto social media and into email threads.
But those alternatives can't satisfy the needs of all Chinese. For example, scientists, engineers and programmers need access to forbidden sites such as Google Scholar and GitHub; journalists hoping to follow the flow of global events will want Twitter; and Chinese students who studied abroad are looking to keep up with their overseas friends via Facebook. In general, all of these groups are educated, relatively affluent and important to the Chinese government's legitimacy and hold on power.
As a result, when the use of VPNs began to boom in the mid-2000s, the Chinese government mostly ignored the phenomenon. If someone could afford a VPN, the reasoning went, then they were probably the kind of citizen that the Chinese government trusted to use one -- middle-class, worldly and with a great deal invested in the stability of the system.
These days, nobody knows how many VPN accounts are active in China. But Twitter claims 10 million Chinese users, and that's certainly a small subset of the total number of people who buy individual VPNs. Even now, a Google search for ""China VPN"" brings up dozens of options.
While mass protests aren't going to break out if the ban is put in place, the Chinese government can ill afford to alienate amiddle-class anxious about slowing economic growth.Developing globally competitive products like software is already more difficult behind the Great Firewall; blocking VPNs certainly isn't going to foster greater creativity. And China's ongoing effort to lure science-and-technology talent from abroad will inevitably be undermined by policies that make it impossible to access Facebook on an iPhone. Even Chinese academics have openly acknowledged that it'll be impossible to reinvent China as a hub for global innovation as long as the country remains cut off from the rest of the world digitally.
How firmly the government intends to police VPNs after February remains an open question. Here's hoping it remembers the words ofFan Binxing, the widely acknowledged ""father"" of China's Great Firewall, who last yearcautionedthe government to treat the internet with care and not to ""give up eating for fear of choking.""

"Journalists play better offense than defense. Give them the ball, and they’ll sleuth out the hidden crumbs of information, filling the scoreboard with touchdowns. Assign them to a dangerous story, and they’ll exhibit the bravery associated with U. S. Marines. Ask them to work late, and they’ll labor all night and file copy at dawn, rat-eyed from exhaustion yet happy and ready for the next story.
But criticize them and ask them to justify what they do and how they do it? They go all go all whiny and preachy, wrap themselves in the First Amendment and proclaim that they’re essential to democracy. I won’t dispute that journalists are crucial to a free society, but just because something is true doesn’t make it persuasive. The chords that aggrieved journalists strike make them sound as entitled as tenured professors. This behavior was on display last Friday after President Donald Trump disparaged the press at CPAC and on Twitter. Later that day, Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, amplified the CPAC insult by excluding CNN, Politico, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and others from an off-camera briefing.
Almost immediately, the press protests went off like a battalion of popguns. “Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest,” said New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet. “This is an undemocratic path that the administration is traveling,” chimed Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron. Others in the press scrum called for retaliation. MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski demanded that the press boycott the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner “until the White House’s abhorrent behavior towards members of the press stops.” Her Morning Joe co-host, Joe Scarborough, likewise insisted, “All news organizations must refuse to attend briefings where major outlets are excluded because of critical coverage.”
On and on it went. Former New York Times labor reporter Steven Greenhouse tweeted that White House reporters should “show some solidarity (and spine) & boycott briefings if Trump Admin excludes certain media.” Writer Simon Schama tweeted for a boycott of “the tinpot dictator’s briefings.” Public radio host Maria Hinojosa (Latino USA) reprised Jay Rosen’s recent idea that the press protest the administration’s behavior by sending interns to White House briefings instead of credentialed reporters. The Washington Post adopted a dreadfully overwrought masthead slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” for its online edition and the New York Times produced a sanctimonious “truth is hard” commercial, which aired during the Oscars. By Sunday morning, Brian Stelter’s guests on Reliable Sources had adopted the wounded theme, which was almost enough to cause me to start rooting against the home team and throw in with Trump.
I understand the press corps’ fury, but does the reaction make sense? As excluded New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush tweeted, there was a deliberate method to Spicer’s madness. It allowed the press secretary to avoid on-camera goofs; it got the press to “whine”; it sowed internal strife among reporters; and it prevented Trump—not Spicer’s biggest fan—from watching his performance. As a piece of lion-taming, the Spicer move was a great success. The lions may still be roaring, but he’s cracking the whip.
There’s nothing Trump and Spicer would love more than a press walkout from gaggles, press briefings, press conferences and assemblies like the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. Boycotts would change the subject from Trump and Spicer’s original insults to the bruised egos of the boycotters—and really, how much sympathy should we expect the masses to have for the gang that brings them reams of bad news every morning? Besides, a boycott would be doomed. To be effective, a boycott must enlist almost everybody. Good luck with that. As candidates for adopting a one-for-all ethos, journalists must rank last. The only organizational principle most of them understand is competition.
For the sake of argument, imagine journalists pulling off a principled boycott after Spicer repeats his Friday stunt. Actually, you don’t have to imagine it—we’re halfway there. The Associated Press and Time boycotted the Friday briefing when they learned of the limitations he had placed on participation. Bloomberg, the Christian Science Monitor, the Wall Street Journal and other outlets have already vowed to shun future closed briefings. But as “principled” reporters peel off to paint protest placards, won’t Spicer merely tilt the briefings toward Trump-friendly media like Breitbart and One America News Network? Remember, Breitbart and OANN’s reporters attended Spicer’s controversial briefing, and they’ll never boycott. Spicer and Trump have already demonstrated a preference for calling on friendly media and will happily shovel interesting news to the pro-Trump outlets who attend. This will create an incentive for news organizations to hold their noses and ditch the boycott. Cozying up to power—writing “beat sweeteners” to gain access and publishing an administration’s planted leaks—has made more than one career in Washington. A boycott will only make the pro-Trump media stronger.
What would I have the press do? Words of protest and pushback, of which we’ve seen plenty, can’t hurt. But the best response, and one that wouldn’t require much in the way of press corps solidarity, would be to make Spicer answer the exiled questions. If, say, Spicer deletes Thrush from another briefing, Thrush can distribute his questions to the invited reporters. When Spicer calls on one, the reporter can say, “Glenn Thrush of the New York Times, who couldn’t be here today, has this question …” And then read it. A couple of rounds of “Thrush questions” and questions from other exiled reporters would not constitute an “I am Spartacus” moment, but it would convey that Spicer can evade news organizations but not their questions. If he can’t stop the reporters’ questions, what’s the point of exiling them?
Reporters have become pawns in Trump’s political strategy. In recent weeks, he’s trotted them out for sacrifice whenever the seeping wound of Russia news gets too moist for him, something NBC News’ Chuck Todd explained Sunday. Instead of taking it personally, I want journalists to take it professionally and continue to report like hell. A great story is always the best revenge.

"CNN’s Brian Stelter had Kellyanne Conway on to talk about how Americans don’t like President Trump and what she is going to do about it. Kellyanne Conway completely flipped it on him and made him look like a total idiot.
“Given President Trump’s historically low approval ratings, what specific steps are you and your colleagues taking to try to repair Trump’s credibility?” asked Stelter.
“The numbers that matter to America is the 1.5 million jobs created on his watch, the 54 record highs in the stock market closes, the consumer confidence level at a 17-year higher, higher than both George W. Bush and President Obama,” responded Kellyanne.
“You have the voice going through your promos saying ‘CNN: the most trusted name in news.’ What evidence do you have of that? I’ve seen polling numbers to the contrary. CNN used to be a place where people can tune in and get the news all day long. Now they get spin and people’s opinions. CNN should own it. Why not say, ‘Look, it’s in our commercial interest at CNN to be anti-Trump. We’re profitable if we’re against the president, most of our viewers are against the president.’ Just own it. Don’t you think that would be more profitable for CNN?” asked Kellyanne.
“I understand that you don’t want an adversarial media. I guess you just want everybody to be like Fox News, state-run media,” responded Stelter which is literally fake news. Fox is not ‘state-run’. “That’s not true. Stop being so jealous of Fox News, Brian, and their ratings. I think that would help if you drop the jealousy a little bit about Fox News. The fact is that we need a media that covers the facts,” said Kellyanne. Check out the video below.",1
"Twitter’s $1.6 million pledge to help fight the White House’s anti-terror immigration order is just the latest case of social media companies taking on Trump, but critics say the same companies are doing next to nothing to stop dangerous radicals from using their platforms to spread hate.
According to sources, radical social media accounts are using photos of Nawar al-Awlaki, the 8-year-old daughter of cleric Anwar al-Awlaki who was killed in the U. S.-led raid in Yemen on Sunday, to recruit members. That’s just the latest in a plethora of social media strategies and campaigns created by extremists to recruit and spread their jidhadi message.
“Recruitment has many forms, and sharing the news of her death and her picture can be seen as a motivation to some to join the jihadi cause,” a spokesperson for the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) told Fox News. “MEMRI’s Jihad and Terrorism Threat Monitor has observed many accounts, both jihadi and non-jihadi, discussing the killing of Nawar al-Awlaki and displaying her picture.”
Companies like Twitter and Facebook have been hit with a slew of civil lawsuits the past year alleging that the companies are liable for the deaths of those killed in terror attacks by ISIS and organizations that have used social media platforms to spread their message. Among those suing are the families of the Pulse Nightclub victims, who filed a lawsuit against Twitter, Facebook and Google alleging the companies provided “material support” to ISIS and helped radicalize the shooter.
A Facebook spokesperson told Fox News that terrorist activity is not allowed on the platform.
“Facebook has zero tolerance for terrorists, terror propaganda, or the praising of terror activity,” a spokesperson for Facebook told Fox News. “We work aggressively to remove it as soon as we become aware of it.”
But the social media giant relies heavily on the Facebook community, of almost 1.7 billion users, to report activity that violates community standards and shows any traces of extremism. Facebook, then, confirms the account of interest, immediately removes it from the platform, and then attempts to identify related material through accounts with associated activity.
But critics say this isn’t a reliable way of tracking accounts of those individuals who have hijacked their profiles to promote propaganda.
“Social media sites and applications have been propaganda multipliers, allowing them to connect with potential followers across countries, cultures and languages,” House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul wrote in a counterterrorism strategy report released last fall. “Social media companies are on the virtual frontlines of the fight and must be proactive in removing terrorist content—they should ensure that their terms and conditions expressly prohibit such material and that takedowns are done quickly to prevent extremist messages from spreading.”
Twitter officials, who did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment regarding its strategy, shut down hundreds of thousands of accounts for threatening or promoting terrorist attacks since mid-2015. Facebook said it has teams around the globe to review reported content 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
But still, small technology companies feel there is more that could be done.
“Users don’t know what they’re looking for –you need to be schooled,” Eric Feinberg, founding member of Global Intellectual Property Enforcement Center, told Fox News. “Some of these things aren’t in English –you can’t rely on people who don’t know what to look for.”
Feinberg’s firm uses a technology that scans for hashtags across social media platforms in different languages for communication that indicates terrorist planning.
But Christopher O’Rourke, CEO of Soteria, a cybersecurity firm based in Charleston, South Carolina, told Fox News that extremists are not as “nave” as people think.
“We’ve been following them for years. They use code words, they are covert,” O’Rourke, who is a former U. S. government-sponsored cyberhacker who worked with the tailored access operations within the NSA, told Fox News. “It’s the silent, smart ones using technology to their benefit that are the most risk for causing problems. You wouldn’t pick up on subtle nuances –you’d notice if someone threatened ‘infidels’, but the thing about terrorists is the smart ones know how to blend in and you can’t really differentiate that.”
O’Rourke criticized Facebook, saying that the company has data on how users interact on the platform, but the algorithms have failed them in the past, such as reports last year of Facebook not sharing certain partisan information, which the company blamed on an algorithm error.
“At the end of the day, computers are not as intelligent as a proper analyst,” O’Rourke told Fox News. “Good, old fashioned man power and communication with law enforcement is what we need.”",1
"Fox News has been moving away from its bread and butter for too long now. They have made far too many decisions that go directly against the wants and needs of their viewers. Ever since they made the decision to get rid of Bill O’Reilly they have been losing viewers left and right. Something needs to be done about it and it needs to be done fast. If they continue on like this they could be dead within months. Many conservatives have gone so far as to boycott the network as they feel they are going too far left.
Bill O’Reilly, however, is doing just as good as ever. He has a new podcast that is played on his website for a monthly fee and it is starting to get extremely popular. Many of his viewers at Fox News have left the network in order to follow O’Reilly. This is what is killing Fox News. O’Reilly was the king of the network and had by far the best ratings of any other show.
That is one of the reasons it came as such a shock. But worry not — it looks like there might be a new conservative network in the works. This new network could possibly feature the likes of Bill O’Reilly, Tomi Lahren and even Sean Hannity. Hannity has been feeling less than comfortable at Fox News ever since they got rid of Bill Shine, the company’s former co-president.
This new network would be an absolute powerhouse and could even give Fox News a run for its leaking money. Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity knows what it takes to run a conservative network and they would have great back up in Tomi Lahren. Hopefully these rumors will turn out to be more than rumors very soon. This is what we have been waiting for.",1
"Counter-intelligence investigators are scrambling to figure out how classified CIA hacking tools were stolen from the CIA — and whether an agency employee, contractors, Russian hackers or some combination of the three is to blame, U. S. officials told NBC News.
A senior intelligence official confirmed to NBC News that the more than 8,000 documents posted by WikiLeaks include authentic material about CIA hacking methods, some of it classified Top Secret. And the CIA is not denying the WikiLeaks claim that it has a much larger archive of material it has yet to publish.
""The damage assessment isn't completed yet,"" said Juan Zarate, a former senior U. S. counterterrorism official and NBC News consultant. ""The intelligence community doesn't know yet what the effects are and the implications of this revelation. But if these documents are authentic, it does reveal CIA capabilities.""
WikiLeaks has claimed it has an even larger trove of documents and computer code that represents a portion of the CIA’s ""hacking arsenal."" A former senior official at the National Security Agency told NBC News that may be exaggerated.
""But I also think there is a pile of stuff in here that looks like the real deal. I imagine the toolset is in the hundreds,"" he said.
Still, he said, ""it's not the whole wad. Not the stuff that I would say is 'Level 10 crown jewels.'""
Outside experts say the CIA has suffered a loss.
""There's been real harm to the CIA's ability to collect intelligence against difficult targets, like terrorists and foreign spies,"" said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, said that many of the hints of exploits contained in the documents were less impressive than they first seemed. The actual malware — the computer code that hackers use to infiltrate phones, smart TVs and computers — was not released by WikiLeaks, he pointed out.
""The remarkable thing is NOT the technical content — but that somebody managed to extract at least 500 megabytes of information from a top secret CIA network,"" he said.
In a statement, CIA spokesman Dean Boyd declined to confirm details, but said, ""The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries. Such disclosures not only jeopardize U. S. personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.""
The FBI has begun a criminal investigation while the CIA conducts its damage assessment, officials say. Investigators are trying to narrow the list of suspects by pouring over computer and travel records.
Meanwhile, the CIA will try to reboot its cyber operations.",0

"Striking photos released Friday show just how dangerously close a Russian fighter jet came to a U. S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft in a Monday interaction deemed ""provocative"" by a U.S. official.
The images show the Russian SU-27 coming within five feet of the wing of the U. S. RC-135U -- so close the Russian pilot can be seen in the cockpit in some images.
Fox News was the first to report the dangerous intercept by the armed Russian jet when it came within a few feet of the U. S. Air Force recon plane.
After it flew alongside, the Russian jet was “provocative” in its flight maneuvers and flying “erratically,” an official told Fox News.
U. S. European Command released the stunning photos of the Baltic Sea encounter.
ARMED RUSSIAN JET COMES WITHIN 5 FEET OF US RECON JET
Since June 2 there have been more than 35 interactions in the Baltic Sea region between U. S. and Russian jets and warships. Intercepts are common and usually considered routine, but EUCOM said the June 19 incident was different “due to the high rate of closure speed and poor control of the aircraft during the intercept.""
""This interaction was determined to be unsafe,” EUCOM said.
Two days later, Sweden summoned Russia's ambassador after another SU-27 jet flew close to a Swedish Gulfstream reconnaissance plane over the Baltic.
RUSSIA FIRES MISSILES FROM MEDITERRANEAN AT ISIS IN SYRIA
The incident also followed the Russian Defense Ministry’s announcement this week that it would treat any U. S. jet flying west of the Euphrates River in Syria as a potential target following a U.S. Navy jet's shoot-down of a Syrian jet that was targeting U.S.-aligned fighters.

"Our Conservative Campaign Committee team left Montana still basking in the afterglow of We the Peoples’ victory over the Democrats’ Trump-resistance operative Rob Quist. Mary and I are in a van with the Conservative Campaign Committee team headed to Georgia.
The Georgia Trump-resistance candidate, Jon Ossoff, is leading in the polls against Republican Karen Handel in the June 20th congressional special election. A Facebook patriot sister in Georgia gave me a heads up that guys wearing pink Planned Parenthood shirts were in her neighborhood putting Ossoff literature on doorknobs.
Losing every special election, Democrats are desperate to energize their fake America-regrets-electing-Trump narrative. Leftists continue to pour millions into the Georgia race, putting all their hate-Trump eggs into Ossoff’s basket.
In typical Democrat bait-and-switch fashion, Ossoff is running as a moderate. In reality, Ossoff is an extreme, far-left radical, backed by off-beat, anti-America groups from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter and numerous other counter-culture weirdo groups; rabidly obsessed with bringing down Trump.
Isn’t the whole idea of Democrats boldly launching a Trump-resistance movement pretty outrageous? Remember the media firestorm over Rush Limbaugh saying he hoped Obama’s agenda failed? Leftists practically demanded that Rush be removed from the air and crucified in the public square, stabbed through the heart with his golden EIB microphone. Rush was excoriated for being a traitor to his country.
And yet, fake news media is orchestrating and praising the Trump-resistance movement as on the moral high ground. These people on the Left who are consumed with out-of-control rage over Hillary losing the election do not give a rat’s derriere about their blatant hypocrisy.
Speaking of Hillary, she’s back! Hillary hit the airways spewing more anti-Trump bitterness to keep the flames of hate, rage and insanity burning in her minions. My fellow patriot Americans, we must remain extremely vigilant in our efforts to keep these Leftist wackos out of power. I still scratch my head, puzzled over what Leftists feel they must so passionately resist from Trump’s presidency.
Why is Trump proclaiming his desire to “make America great again” as repulsive to Leftists as showing Dracula the cross? If you are a Leftist, wouldn’t you still want your country, your homeland to be made great? These people are simply not right in the head, folks.
The Left has gone totally insane. Cable news has become 24/7 destruction of Trump. It is as if nothing in the world matters other than removing Trump from office.
On Fox News, Bill Bennett noted how fake news media was far more outraged over the Montana Republican candidate tussling with a reporter than they were over the 22 people killed in the Manchester terrorist attack and 26 Coptic Christians murdered in Egypt. Fake news media’s passion and interest is only in events which further its Trump-must-be-removed narrative. Clearly, they have lost their minds, obsessed beyond reason.
A majority of Americans, 65%, believe the media publishes fake news. In a Montana store, I overheard an employee expressing her support of Trump to another employee. She said she believes nothing reported in the media.
Fake news media have thrown all pretense of being fair and balanced out the window. They are in full-court-press remove-Trump mode. My bottom line is it is us against them, folks. Thanks and may God bless you for your faithful support of our efforts. I’ll report in again from Georgia.

"This post How to Survive a Biotech Blowup appeared first on Daily Reckoning.
Big biotech stocks were primed and ready to rip higher at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Let me set the scene for you…
Smaller biotech stocks were already popping left and right. Throughout late September, small-cap and microcap biotech stocks stole the show. The market was spitting out huge winners almost every single day. As these smaller stocks overextended their gains, we turned to their bigger cousins to keep the biotech bull alive.
That’s when the market threw a wrench in our gears.
October was not kind to the biggest names in biotech. While smaller, more speculative biotech names consolidated, the big kids fell off a cliff. The biotech slide accelerated midway through the month, with both the large-cap iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) and the smaller SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI) slipping more than 5%.
Over the past couple of trading weeks, the smaller biotech ETF has recovered most of its losses. Meanwhile, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology EFT still looks heavy. It remains down more than 5% since Oct. 1st.
The trouble started when earnings season took a bite out of one of our favorite biotech high-flyers: Celgene Corp. (NASDAQ:CELG).
We bought CELG’s June dip and rode the trend from $120 to $145. But shares started to look heavy as October trading progressed. We threw in the towel after an abrupt drop pushed the stock back to our entry point. But as it turns out, this slump was only a preview of what was to come.
Celgene reported dismal earnings the day after we dumped shares. The company completely whiffed on its sales forecasts and cut revenue outlook through 2020. The news was enough to scare even more investors away from the stock. Shares fell a quick $20 on the day.
The good news is CELG telegraphed its bad news ahead of time, giving us the opportunity to get out of the stock before it could do any significant damage to our trading portfolio. The bad news is the company’s disastrous earnings report unleashed a flurry of selling throughout the market’s biggest and best-known biotech names.
As I noted at the beginning of the quarter, some of the Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF’s biggest holdings spent the better part of September consolidating their summer gains. Thankfully, new buyers were already appearing in October helping to snap these stocks back to attention.
Major players such as Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Regneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN), and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) were bouncing off support and showing signs of life after their third-quarter slumps. Fast forward to November and all these stocks have failed to hold their gains. GILD and AMGN are threatening to retest their respective 200-day moving averages. Meanwhile, REGN has already broken through its 200-day and is now down 25% from its summer highs.
Now that the dust has settled, it’s clear that sector’s biggest stocks aren’t yet ready to carry the biotech torch. Instead, the smaller biotech names populating the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF remain our best bet for gains as the market makes its year-end push.

"In what is becoming a rather continuous theme, former CIA spy Robert Steele has dropped more bombshell truths for the world to grasp. This time, the revelations came in a live interview on Russia Today.
This is the same Robert Steele who appeared on RT in March of 2015 and said that every terrorist attack in the U. S. has been a false flag event.
It comes as no surprise then that Steele once again openly spoke about uncomfortable truths in an interview with RT last week.
Hillary and the DNC stole 13 primaries from Bernie Sanders using electronic vote tampering:“Hillary Clinton, it’s on record, Stanford University has studied this and documented this, stole 13 primaries from Bernie Sanders using electronic ballot tampering. The Russians did not hack the election, Hillary Clinton hacked the election and lost.”
The Counter-Coup:“We’ve had a counter-coup in the United States. We have successfully defeated the coup that was being led by Wall Street, Hillary Clinton and John Brennan (CIA Director).
The Electoral Reform Act of 2017 is a must:“My personal feeling is that if Trump does not pass an Electoral Reform Act in the next 90 days, he will not finish his term. He will leave. The Electoral Reform Act does a number of things but one of the most important things is that it free the members from the bribery and blackmail that is pervasive in U. S. politics. I think Trump has the capacity to free the members from their dependency on foreign money, particularly Saudi Arabian, Israeli and Wall Street money. It destroy’s the 2-party tyranny. I have tried for over 3 years to get the mainstream media to cover Electoral Reform. They won’t touch it.”
Russia Did Not Hack The Election:“This has been disproven completely. First off, I sounded the alarm on cyber-security in 1994. I wrote the first letter to the White House, I introduced NSA to hackers, I was the opening speaker of Hackers on Planet Earth in 1994. I am, as it were, a strong representative of the hacking community going back 30 years. I know what I’m talking about. The DNC was a leak, not a hack. Julian Assange, William Binney from the NSA, Ambassador Craig Murray and I and Ray McGovern and Phil Giraldi, we’re all saying the same thing. This was a leak, not a hack. I’ve listed 29 different people with links to their public statements saying the Russians did not hack the election. It was a leak. The ‘Russians hacked the election’ is now a dead meme.”
John Brennan Should Be Tried As a WarCriminal:“The lies that John Brennan has told, both anonymously and publicly, are in my view, an impeachable offense. He has prostituted his office the way that George Tenet prostituted his office when he led with Dick Cheney the telling of 935 lies that led us into Iraq. Brennan should be in an international court under indictment for being a war criminal. If you want to play war criminal, let’s start with John Brennan. The drone assassination program by CIA is killing thousands, 98% of whom are known to not be on any list. They’re women, children and innocent old men.
Mainstream Media Has Been Revealed As The Fake News:“In the panic to repress skeptical citizens and investigative journalists, the fake news meme, like the conspiracy meme that the CIA invented in the 1960s to diminish people who were questioning the JFK story, has been intended to diminish citizens saying ‘hey wait a minute, there’s a pizza-gate, there’s a pedo-gate, there’s all these other things. What has happened is that now everyone understands what they’ve refused to believe in the past, which is that the New York Times, the Crap News Media, all of these people, are the fake news.”
Reince Priebus Has Penetrated the Trump Administration & Doesn’t Want Trump to “Unrig the System”: “Reince Priebus, in my view, is a spy on Trump who is opposing Trump from within. I personally believe Priebus should not be allowed to be Chief of Staff. Trump now has the power, should he choose to use it, to unrig the system. And that’s where I’m really concerned, because Reince Priebus’ highest priority in life is to stop Donald Trump from unrigging the system.”
There are also many other truths that Steele has revealed in this interview that can be seen here.
What is important to take from this is that yet another person has come out and shredded the many lies that have been told to the world for a very long time. The fact that this was said on RT, which reaches many people around the world, is yet another sign of the times we live in. The truth is continuing to gain momentum at an unprecedented rate, which is making some people very excited, and certain others, very nervous.",1
"A recently-resurfaced patent filed by Facebook previously evinces the social media platform’s remarkably Orwellian goal of reading users’ emotions upon encountering various content — information which would then be used to tailor material for relevance to a person’s mood.
Flatly called“Techniques for emotion detection and content delivery,”the patent — filed in November2015 andrediscoveredby New York-based marketing intelligence firm, CB Insights, upon its granting on May 25, 2017 —“would automatically add emotional information to text messages, predicting the user’s emotion based on methods of keyboard input. The visual format of the text message would adapt in real time based on the user’s predicted emotion. As the patent notes (and as many people have likely experienced), it can be hard to convey mood and intended meaning in a text-only message; this system would aim to reduce misunderstandings.
“The system could pick up data from the keyboard, mouse, touch pad, touch screen, or other input devices, and the patent mentions predicting emotion based on relative typing speed, how hard the keys are pressed, movement (using the phone’s accelerometer), location, and other factors.”
It seems the goliath social media platform’s goal — at least superficially — is to keep users interested enough to make visits to the site longer in duration.
But the creepiness factor — and the tacit removal of user’s ability to choose which content they’d like to see — makes Facebook’s patent a dangerous foray into further control, beyond even the already infuriating algorithms about which users have complained for years.
“If you smiled as you looked at pictures of one of your friends, for instance, Facebook’s algorithm would take note of that and display more pictures of that friend in your News Feed.
“Another example included in the patent application explains that if you looked away from your screen when a video of a kitten played, Facebook would stop showing similar type of videos in your Feed.
“In another case, the document says that if you happened to watch an advert for scotch, Facebook could choose to target you with more adverts for scotch.”
A second patent, called“Systems and methods for dynamically generating emojis based on image analysis of facial features,”indicates the possibility emojis could be conjured to fit a user’s mood — and Facebookrefusedto confirm to theDaily Mailwhether or not it would be employed.
“The patent mentions several additional features, such as the ability to modify the emoji based on more detailed analysis of the user’s face, and the ability to capture gestures made by the user and add those to the emoji […]
“By reducing users’ facial expressions to emojis from a pre-set list, Facebook could potentially analyze users’ emotions more easily. Facebook could gain clearer insight into feelings and reactions, while also adding a new interactive feature.”
It appears Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg didn’t learn any conceivable lesson in previous flirtations with manipulating users’ emotions.
In 2014, millions of users were jolted to learn Facebook hadperformeda secret social engineering experiment by deftly crafting information posted to 689,000 profiles — filtering posts, videos, comments, images, and links — to make people feel more positively or negatively through a process known as “emotional contagion.”
“Emotions expressed by friends, via online social networks, influence our own moods, constituting, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence for massive-scale emotional contagion via social networks,”the joint Cornell University and University of California study, conducted unbeknownst to users and without their permission,found.
Ensuing contention excoriated the world’s largest social media platform, and Facebook was later forced to capitulate,statingit“failed to communicate clearly why and how we did it.”
Privacy advocates, activists, and attorneys were appalled at the mass, secretive intrusion, and — mostly due to the covert nature of the experiment — rumors occasionally circulate that other such analyses are still being conducted.
However fundamentally invasive the rediscovered patent might sound in the context of the prior PR nightmare, a Facebook spokesperson cited by the Independent insisted, “We often seek patents for technology we never implement, and patents should not be taken as an indication of future plans.”
Of course, Facebook users around the world didn’t find comfort in a picture which surfaced last year of Zuckerberg with his web camera taped over — a detail which could now only kindle suspicions the patent technology might already be the subject of a test run.
Whistleblower Edward Snowden’s ominous warning to everyone to cover the cameras and microphones on all devices seems all the more prescient.",1
"The fall of Roger Ailes: He made Fox News his ‘locker room’ — and now women are telling their stories         Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.    You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.
The Washington Post’s Paul Farhi explains what’s next for Fox News and the Murdoch family, now that Roger Ailes is out as chairman and chief executive of Fox News. (Peter Stevenson,Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)    One day in early June, an embattled but determined news anchor, a public relations man and a group of attorneys settled into chairs around the conference table on the 35th floor of a law office on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. Gretchen Carlson’s tenure as an on-air host at Fox News was imperiled, and she knew it. For the previous nine months she’d been quietly meeting with attorneys to craft a sexual-harassment lawsuit against her boss, the all-powerful Fox News chairman, Roger Ailes. Now she was almost ready to go public with her allegation that Ailes had sabotaged her career because she wouldn’t have sex with him. But questions ricocheted around the room. What would be the fallout? How would this be perceived? How would it play? “We knew Fox was a high-powered, very potent machine that would go into full attack mode,” recalled Carlson’s public relations agent, Allan Ripp, who was meeting his client for the first time that day. “But she was resolved.” Within weeks, Carlson would be out of a job, and a cascading series of events, unfolding with dizzying speed, would culminate in the public shaming and resignation this week of Ailes, one of the most influential executives in American television history, as well as a primary architect of the modern-day Republican Party and conservative movement. News of Carlson’s firing, and the lawsuit she filed shortly thereafter, have now prompted 25 women to come forward with what they describe as similar harassment claims against Ailes that stretch across five decades back to his days in the 1960s as a young television producer, according to Carlson’s attorney, Nancy Erika Smith.  [Roger Ailes resigns as CEO of Fox News; Rupert Murdoch will be acting CEO]   Interviews with four of those women portray the 76-year-old television powerhouse as a man who could be routinely crude and inappropriate, ogling young women, commenting about their breasts and legs, and fostering a macho, insensitive culture. Three of the women were speaking about their allegations for the first time, including a 2002 Fox News intern who says Ailes grabbed her buttocks, and a Fox News employee who says Ailes touched her and tried to kiss her against her will at his office in 2004.   “Roger is committed to defending himself against the campaign that is being waged to destroy his reputation including the vigorous refutation of demonstrably false and incredible charges,” his attorney Susan Estrich said in a statement. “It is virtually impossible to respond to anonymous allegations, much less ones that are fourteen or even thirty years old, especially charges never made at the time of the alleged occurrence. In the law, this impossibility is why we have statutes of limitation, that are at most three years.”  Many of the allegations that have become public — first in New York magazine and then elsewhere — are clustered in the decades long before Ailes became the founding chief executive officer and guiding light of media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s new Fox News Channel in 1996. Some involve instances of Ailes kissing or touching women against their will; others fall into the realm of boorish behavior, off-color quips and assertions that women needed to provide sexual favors to advance their careers. Some Ailes loyalists suspect the scandal has been seriously overblown and has become a convenient vehicle for Murdoch’s sons — Lachlan and James — who have long wanted to vanquish the bombastic Fox News titan who had always been shielded by their father. A long list of the ousted executive’s current and former staffers have come to his defense, including Maria Bartiromo, Neil Cavuto and Greta Van Susteren, the latter who said she’d “never seen or heard about” sexual harassment involving Ailes. Mary Matalin, who hosted a program when Ailes ran CNBC and has been a friend for years, said she’d never seen or heard of harassment allegations. “To us, sexism at the work place was not being treated as roughly/honestly as men; politics and TV are not places for sugar cubes,” she wrote in an email. Others have painted Ailes as a somewhat out-of-touch relic of another era but far from a serial harasser. “I look at Roger, it’s like ‘Mad Men,’” said an ex-high-ranking Fox News executive, one of more than two dozen current and former network employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution or hadsigned nondisclosure agreements.“This guy came of age in the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s when it was a whole different culture. I don’t think he was thinking that [what he was saying] was really all that bad.”
Roger Ailes resigned as chairman and chief executive of Fox News on Thursday. (Jim Cooper/Associated Press)  Ailes, the son of an Ohio factory foreman, learned the television business in the 1960s during stints at stations in Cleveland and Philadelphia. Television was a male-dominated field in those days — it wasn’t until 1976 that change came; Barbara Walters became the first female co-anchor of a network newscast.  Ailes’s break came when he got a job as a prop boy on “The Mike Douglas Show,” a talk show that was nationally syndicated in 1963. In the mid-1960s, while Ailes was still on the rise, a woman who was then an 18-year-old model says her agency called her for an audition with the Douglas show. They were looking for two women to do a skit, the woman — who spoke on the condition of anonymity — said in an interview. She was called into a room — she thinks it was at a hotel, but isn’t sure — and met Ailes. “Suddenly, he grabbed me and kissed me,” she told The Washington Post. “I froze. I just didn’t know what to do. I think I had just gotten my first kiss from my boyfriend, so I didn’t know what to do. I just froze.” The woman said Ailes told her: “I need you to be receptive. We only hire girls who are cooperative.” “I was speechless,” she recalled. “No one has ever violated me that way before or since. ... I never saw something like that coming. I wasn’t worldly. I grew up on a farm. It was a shock to me. I got out of there as fast as I could. I was so horrified. I said to myself, ‘I’m going to remember that man’s name.’” Ailes, who eventually became executive producer of Douglas’s show, met Richard M. Nixon while the presidential candidate was waiting to appear on the program. Soon, he was working for him. Ailes’s work on the Nixon campaign made him a political star. He started his own political consulting firm and became a key adviser to a generation of national Republican figures, later playing a central role in shaping the public image of George H. W. Bush in his successful 1988 campaign against Michael Dukakis. Around that time, another woman — a receptionist in Ailes’s consulting office — says he sexually harassed her. “He said I was a cross between Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield,” the woman said in an interview. “He said I was sexy. ... I had studied theater, dance and voice in school, so I wanted to work in television.” Ailes once called her into his office, the woman said, then locked the door. She said he then told her that he could introduce her to power players in the industry who would cast her on television shows.  Then, she said, her spirits sank. “He said: ‘Let me explain to you how casting works. There are 20people up for a part, and maybe 10are right for it. And maybe five really show how much they want the part. You understand what I’m telling you?’” She had no doubt that he was suggesting that she would have to sleep with him. “It was pretty obvious what he meant,” she said. “I went into shock. I was shaking at my desk. I went home from work and told my mother to forget the big dreams I had, that I wasn’t going to see my name in lights because I wasn’t sleeping with Orson Welles.” Later, she recalled, she decided to quit. She ran into Ailes as she was leaving. He didn’t seem surprised, she said, and he didn’t seem to care. Ailes’s bravado and insouciance seemed like a perfect match for the new network that billionaire Rupert Murdoch was launching in the mid-1990s. The newsrooms in Murdoch’s empire were salty places, and Fox News would assume a measure of that swagger. “Boorish behavior is Murdoch company behavior — boorish behavior as defined by tough-guy behavior,” Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff said in an interview. “The tough-guy behavior sometimes intersects with sexual harassment, and this is very strong within the organization.” In a statement Thursday announcing Ailes’s resignation (which made no mention of the claims against Ailes), Lachlan and James Murdoch said: “We continue our commitment to maintaining a work environment based on trust and respect. We take seriously our responsibility to uphold these traditional, long-standing values of our company.” Ailes birthed an unabashedly right-leaning network, heavy on opinion, and succeeded in obliterating his main rival, CNN, in the ratings and making huge profits. He also pushed for a very specific look: blond and leggy. Television had long been the realm of perfectly coiffed commentators and anchors, but under Ailes, Fox News seemed to be taking the ethos to another level. “Generally, women accept that at Fox you are expected to wear skirts [and] dresses and that the makeup people are going to slather it on and make you look like a bimbo,” said a former frequent guest commentator. One time, the former commentator said, higher-ups at the network reprimanded makeup artists for putting her on-air without false eyelashes, even though she hated wearing them. A late-night anchor boasted about the “leg chair” on his set, where the audience could get a full view of the on-air talent’s legs. “From the very beginning, Roger wanted attractive women, translucent desks,” a prominent early staffer said in an interview. The message from Ailes was unmistakable, the former staffer said: “I want to see her legs. I want the viewers to see their legs. I want people to watch Fox News even if the sound is turned down.” The signals sent by Ailes were quickly picked up by the employees, the former staffer said. Some women began showing up to news meetings in short skirts and blouses that showed their cleavage. “It became common knowledge that women did not want to be alone with him,” the former staffer said. “They would bring other men with them when they had to meet him. It became a locker room, towel-snapping environment. He would say things like, ‘She’s really got the goods’ and ‘look at the t--s on that one.’” Sometimes, the former staffer said, Ailes made “jokes that he liked having women on their knees. The tone he set went through the organization.” From at least 2003 to 2005, women who worked in the advertising and promotions division of Fox News said their boss, Fox News Vice President Joe Chillemi, routinely berated them with obscenities and vulgarities. After investigating the reports, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit against Fox News, alleging that Chillemi, a top Ailes deputy, had created a hostile workplace. The EEOC said Chillemi cursed and denigrated women in the office, calling them “bitch” and telling them to “be a man.” Fox News denied the allegations and settled the suit in 2006 for $225,000. All the while, former staffers say, Ailes wasn’t moderating his tone. He sometimes made remarks in meetings about women’s appearances, such as calling them beautiful or saying everyone would want to date them. There were women who didn’t like it but said nothing. “I always found working at Fox like being in the military,” a former high-ranking Fox executive said in an interview. “Everybody was a loyalist. Everybody was a lieutenant to Roger the general.” The general always had attendants. In May 2002, a 20-year-old college student scored an accounting internship with Fox News, but to her surprise she ended up being assigned to work for Ailes, the woman recalled in an interview with The Post. The woman fit the profile of a future Fox News standout. She was pretty and blond. Not long after she started the job, Ailes asked her to get him a copy of Maxim, the racy men’s magazine. “When I gave it to him, he said: ‘There are some great articles in here. And you’re pretty enough to be in here. You look like the women in here. You have great legs. If you sleep with me, you could be a model or a newscaster.’” She told him she “wasn’t that kind of person.” But he persisted, she said. “At first it was once a week,” she said. “Then it got to be every day.” She said she quit after only a few weeks. “When I told him I was leaving, he said he was sorry I was leaving and that he was really disappointed that I didn’t sleep with him,” she recalled. “He said, ‘You could have gotten anything you wanted.’” “And then he grabbed me,” she said, “and grabbed my ass.” A similar pattern appears in the allegations of another woman, a former Fox News employee, who says she was harassed by Ailes in 2004. The woman, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity, says Ailes and an assistant offered to pay for her professional development and introduced her to a talent agent. In Ailes’s office one day, she says, Ailes suggested the woman have a drink with him alone at a hotel. She says he asked her, “Do you know how to play the game?” He tried to kiss her, she recalled.  “He was touching me,” she said. “I got out of there as quickly as I could.  She says she was traumatized and couldn’t sleep. Later, she told him that she wouldn’t meet him at the hotel. Her professional development opportunities then disappeared, she said.   The next year, when Gretchen Carlson, a CBS reporter and 1989 Miss America pageant winner, joined Fox News, she was under no illusions about what people thought of the network’s anchors. “I like to joke that when I joined Fox News I hit the ‘bimbo trifecta’: Former Miss America. Blonde. Fox News host. ... I may have achieved a Google record for being called dumb or a bimbo,” she wrote in her memoir, “Getting Real,” published in 2015. “Never mind that I’d graduated with honors at Stanford or studied at Oxford.” Ailes was part of the appeal of the network for the rising TV star.  At Fox News, she landed a spot as a co-host of the wildly popular morning program “Fox & Friends.” For a time, she was happy there. In her book, she writes glowingly of Ailes. “Roger Ailes, the most accessible boss I’ve ever worked for, was behind the scenes. He saw Fox as a big family, and he cared about everything we did.” But by 2009, Carlson alleges, she was being subjected to a “hostile work environment” by one of her co-hosts, Steve Doocy. Carlson alleged that Doocy was “sexist and condescending,” and she accused him of “putting his hand on her and pulling down her arm on live TV.” Doocy did not respond to an interview request. Carlson, however, could engage in sexually charged banter on-air. Once she seemed to surprise Doocy by giving him a present during the program — a container of “potent Turkish Viagra” — and telling him that if “you take this you can ‘blank’ many times. ... All you do is take a few sips at night and you’re a man.” When Ailes heard about her concerns, Carlson alleges, Ailes called her a “man hater” and said she should learn to “get along with the boys,” punishing her by blocking her from doing big interviews, she alleges. In 2013, she lost her co-host job and, according to her lawsuit, took a substantial pay cut. She was, however, given her own program, “The Real Story With Gretchen Carlson.” But it would air for only an hour in a less-desirable midafternoon slot. After the switch, Carlson alleges, Ailes, who has been married since 1998, continued to harass her.  He asked her to turn around so he “could see her posterior,” she alleges, and told her “I’m sure you can do sweet nothings when you want to.” She said he embarrassed her by telling her in front of a group of people that he likes to remain seated when women greet him, so they have to “bend over.”Carlson says she confronted Ailes in his office in September. “I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago, and then you’d be good and better and I’d be good and better,” she alleges he told her. It was after that meeting that Carlson called Smith, the attorney who would represent her in the lawsuit. They worked on the lawsuit. But they didn’t say a word to Fox News, according to Ripp, the public relations consultant. On June 23 — two days after her 50th birthday — Fox News fired Carlson. What Fox News didn’t know at the time, Ripp said, was that a version of Carlson’s lawsuit had already been drafted. Fox News was aggressive. Ailes blasted her, accusing her of filing the suit in retaliation for her firing. Wolff, the Murdoch biographer, couldn’t help thinking the billionaire’s sons were taking advantage of the situation to achieve their goal of excising Ailes. “This is not principally about sexual harassment,” Wolff said. “This is an internal coup.” (“Nothing could be further from the truth,” said a person at 21st Century Fox with knowledge of the situation.) Carlson and her team had decided early on that they would need to move fast to counter the Fox News public relations offensive, which was portraying the former anchor as a disgruntled employee. The network released friendly handwritten notes Carlson had sent Ailes, including one with a smiley face. But Carlson was able to punch back because she had something else working in her favor: The story kept getting bigger. Smith said other accusers began contacting her. “I was enraged,” said the woman who claims Ailes harassed her as an 18-year-old in the ’60s. “I emailed her and said, ‘Any way I can help, I will.’ I signed my real name. This guy has gotten away with this for a long time. Every time I saw his name on the news through the years, it brought it back.” Days after the lawsuit was filed, New York magazine’s Gabriel Sherman, author of an Ailes biography, published a report detailing the allegations of six women, including one who described Ailes’s genitalia in graphic detail and said he had exposed himself to her. Even on Thursday, as the media world was rocked by news of Ailes’s resignation, Smith said she was hearing from more women. “They keep coming,” she said. “I got three today.” Alice Crites and Ana Swanson contributed to this report.

"A headline on an airline website reads: ""We're happy to announce that there will no longer be any fuel surcharge for all flights."" Is this happy news coming from American, Delta or United? None of the above.
This may not seem like a radical move. After all, oil prices are currently hovering around $48 per barrel, less than half the price of June 2014 ($105). And according to news reports, other airlines have plans to lower surcharges, including Japan Air Lines and Qatar Airways. But it is radical, because most others aren't.
If you don't know about airline fuel surcharges, you're not alone. They're embedded in the price of a ticket and are especially hefty for international flights. Here's a price breakdown on a major U. S. airline's round-trip ticket between London and New York in February:
As you can see, the carrier-imposed charges, or fuel surcharge, is higher than the cost of the actual airfare. And that same exact surcharge - $458 - was imposed on London-New York flights back in August, when a barrel of oil was going for $97, or twice the current price. Why are U. S. airlines keeping fuel surcharges, and keeping them so high?
Because they can. There is no incentive to drop prices because demand is good. And this is a nice change for airlines after the dismal days of the 2000s when carriers were going under and many turned to mergers for survival.
But changes may be coming. I anticipate more airlines will lower fuel surcharges especially on fares to Europe in the spring. In part this will be due to political pressure from people like Sen. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N. Y., who have long been asking pointed questions about fuel surcharges and will begin demanding answers.
Of course, any changes depend on the price of oil. No one can say for sure how that will play out in the months to come, but the downward oil price trend hasn't ended yet.

"Another horrific incident has occurred in London where a 24-story building that functioned as public housing to some 600 people caught fire on Wednesday and quickly went up in a blazing inferno. It was a scene perhaps even more disturbing than the one that occurred back on September 11, 2001, to the infamous “Building 7,” which caught fire from the two main World Trade Center towers before suddenly and unexpectedly free-falling within its own footprint.
Grenfell Tower in West London did not collapse like Building 7, even though the fire was much worse and engulfed the entire building. It is still said to be smoldering, in fact, with at least 30 confirmed deaths and many more expected. First responders say that when all is said and done, the final death toll could top 100 victims, making the Grenfell Tower fire one of the worst tragedies to occur in recent history.
Here’s an image of Grenfell Tower engulfed in smoke and flames, courtesy of The Atlantic
As locals and former residents of Grenfell Tower seek answers as to what caused the fire, others are asking themselves: why didn’t Grenfell Tower collapse on itself like Building 7? If the fire was much worse, then it should have creased right in the middle like Building 7 did and collapse just minutes later like an old Las Vegas casino being demolished to make way for a new resort.
But it did not, and there is a good scientific reason for this: Building 7 was intentionally taken down through a controlled demolition, while Grenfell Tower simply caught fire and burned everything that it could before being put out. This is what typically happens to buildings made out of steel and concrete: they remain standing after everything inside that’s flammable has been burned and turned to dust.
Here you can see the hollow shell left behind at Grenfell Tower after the fire ran its course, courtesy of BBC News.
Bombshell truth: It is physically impossible for common fires to melt concrete or steel
If you are not even familiar with Building 7, it is probably because the news media was quick to cover it up because it didn’t fit the official narrative that airplanes brought down the World Trade Center towers. Building 7 was not even hit by an airplane, and yet it collapsed just like the other two in perfect downward formation, almost like it was detonated.
Watch for yourself this compilation of video footage showing Building 7 collapsing after what appears to be a relatively minor fire, at least compared to the one that recently took place at Grenfell Tower.
It is difficult not to find Building 7’s collapse highly suspicious, especially when considering that the fire inside is much smaller and much more contained than the one that occurred at Grenfell Tower. It is also important to note that Building 7, like the Twin Towers, was specifically designed to withstand fires and not collapse.
In fact, all steel and concrete structures are designed this way because neither steel nor concrete can be melted by fires – yes, even jet fuel fires. That’s why Grenfell Tower is still standing. But Building 7 isn’t because, spoiler alert, it was rigged in advance with explosives and intentionally taken down. More than 1,500 engineers and architects agree, having formed Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth to make this truth known.
What happened at Grenfell Tower is deeply tragic. But so is the fact that many people still believe all the lies about the World Trade Center and Building 7.",1
"A car plowed into protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, today, injuring multiple people severely — killing one — and, as first responders rushed to perform CPR and tend to the injured, law enforcement hunted down the badly damaged vehicle — and reportedly arrested the driver.
“We’re closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia,” President Trump said Saturday from New Jersey, quoted by CBS News, which pointed out the commander-in-chief did not address brazen Nazi symbolism and regalia worn by the self-identified alt-right attendees. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides.”
“It’s been going on for a long time in our country,” Trump said of racism and bigotry at the chaotic event.“Not Donald Trump. Not Barack Obama. It’s been going on for a long, long time.”
“We have to heal the wounds of our country,” the president concluded.
“I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will,” tweeted Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer, “go home.”

“BREAKING: Hospital official says one dead, 19 injured after car plows into a group of protesters in downtown Charlottesville, Va.,” the Associated Press reported via Twitter late Saturday afternoon.
BREAKING: Hospital official says one dead, 19 injured after car plows into a group of protesters in downtown Charlottesville, Va.
Just prior to the incident, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency over ongoing bloody clashes taking place at planned protests over the removal of a Civil War-era statue, and, more broadly, disputes over the perceived rise of white nationalism, fascism, and other hot-button social issues.
Governor McAuliffe has declared a state of emergency to aid state response to violence at Alt-Right rally in Charlottesville
Witnesses variously told a smattering of reporters on scene a gray muscle car drove toward marchers at a high rate of speed, slammed into several people, possibly smashing them between the attacking and another vehicle, shifted the car quickly into reverse and drove rapidly backwards away from the scene.
Billing the demonstration as an attempt to “unify the right-wing against a totalitarian Communist crackdown,” participants calling themselves Unite the Right held a march last night in Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, carrying tiki torches in a procession — which, ultimately, kettled a smaller group of counter-protesters, sparking brutal skirmishes.
Altercations began again early on Saturday in advance of a planned rally already assumed to turn violent, including the deadly incident involving the vehicle.
Following the deadly incident, police cordoned off at least one block, and a reporter claimed to have seen a helicopter overhead, though it was unclear whether those details were related.
According toTaylor Lorenz, a reporter for Mic and The Hill,“Anyway several police officers at the station here think the guy running people down wasn’t malicious. They said the driver was scared.”
Anyway several police officers at the station here think the guy running people down wasn’t malicious. They said the driver was scared
Whether or not there was a motive, what that might have been, and additional pertinent information has yet to be reported; but, as the volatile situation continues to unfold, details will be updated as necessary.

"The New York Daily News, which bills itself as ""New York's Hometown Newspaper,"" has been acquired by newspaper publisher Tronc.
The deal was struck for $1 and the assumption of pension and operational liabilities, according to The Chicago Tribune, which is owned by Tronc. The sale price is 50 cents less than the Sunday edition of the newspaper and matches the weekday newsstand price of $1 per copy.
In 1993, real estate magnate Mort Zuckerman bought it for $36 million. The newspaper's liabilities may exceed $30 million, The New York Times said. Chicago-based Tronc (TRNC), which also publishes the Los Angeles Times, announced the deal Monday night, and the Daily News posted a story on its website. It was first reported by The New York Times.
The Daily News, which won a Pulitzer this year, has been buffeted by the changing media environment. Like other newspapers, its circulation has plummeted amid the shift to digital news. Tronc said the company was committed to maintaining the quality of the newspaper's journalism.
Tronc CEO Justin Dearborn said acquiring the paper and its popular website would ""provide us with another strategic platform for growing our digital business, expanding our reach and broadening our services for advertisers and marketers.""
The deal puts the Daily News under the umbrella of one of the nation's major newspaper chains, with properties spanning from the Hartford Courant in Connecticut to the Sun-Sentinel in South Florida.
""Over the past near-century, the New York Daily News has served New York City and its surrounding areas with its award-winning journalism and helped shape the dynamics of the city,"" News owner Zuckerman said in a release.
Tronc — which evolved from Daily News founder the Tribune Co. — gets a presence in the New York media market, a news site with about 25 million unique monthly visitors and other assets. Under the terms of the deal, Tronc said it assumed the Daily News' operational and pension liabilities and got 100 percent ownership of its Jersey City, New Jersey, printing plant and a 49.9 percent interest in the plant's 25-acre (10-hectare) property, which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.
With the deal, News Editor-in-Chief Arthur Browne was also named publisher, though he plans to retire at the end of the year.
Founded in 1919, the Daily News considers itself ""New York's Hometown Newspaper,"" informing everyday New Yorkers about their city and more. It has been known over the years for zesty headlines — perhaps most notably ""Ford to City: Drop Dead"" during the New York's financial woes in 1975 — gossip, city coverage and star columnists that included Jimmy Breslin, Pete Hamill and Liz Smith.
Lately, the tabloid has also attracted attention with its unsparing criticism of President Donald Trump. (Trump, in return, branded the paper ""worthless"" and Zuckerman ""dopey"" in tweets last year.)
The Daily News and ProPublica together won this year's Pulitzer Prize in public service journalism for uncovering how authorities used an obscure law to evict hundreds of people, mostly poor minorities, from their homes. It was the Daily News' 11th Pulitzer Prize, and the fifth during Zuckerman's tenure.
But the paper has also contended with the shifts in news consumption and advertising that have affected newspapers in general in the digital age. The newspaper industry has been suffering for years from declining print circulation and advertising revenue, as readership and ad dollars have shifted online. Online ad sales have increased for newspaper companies, but not always enough to offset the decline in print revenue.
The Daily News also grappled with a muscular hometown tabloid rival, the News Corp.-owned New York Post.
Zuckerman eyed selling the Daily News in 2015 but ultimately took it off the market.",0

"There has been late lobbying by various agencies of the U. S. government asking President Trump to hold off on releasing some of the John F. Kennedy assassination documents, and the White House was reportedly receptive to some of those requests.
The White House will release 2,800 of the JFK assassination documents Thursday, with the release of other redacted records postponed for 180 days, so that they can be reviewed, White House officials said during a conference call Thursday afternoon.
* How to view the JFK assassination documents online
The requests – some of which were registered a couple of months ago and some more recently -- come from agencies throughout the government including the CIA and FBI.
Some of the worry seems to center around documents created in the 1990's, when the congressional committee was crafting the legislation setting Thursday as the release date.
Multiple officials at multiple agencies tells CBS News there is concern the documents may reveal sources and operations from the near past and include current people or operations. Of particular concern, according to officials, are names in the documents.
A spokesperson for the CIA told CBS News the agency welcomes the president's directive to further review the records to identify any additional information that can be released. The spokesman said every single one of the remaining roughly 18,000 CIA records will ultimately be released, with no document withheld in full. The CIA wants to protect the identity of CIA assets and current and former CIA officers, as well as intelligence methods and partnerships that are still relevant.
CBS News' Chip Reid interviewed JFK scholar Larry Sabato, at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, who said he had been told that ""at least most of it will not be released Thursday because not just the CIA, but apparently other agencies, unnamed -- I assume the FBI is one -- are appealing.""
Sabato says that the CIA wants some of the names in the documents redacted, and some of the paragraphs they say reveal the names of sources or methods used by the CIA.

"Everyone who has ever watched a Sean Spicer press conference has witnessed the melt down and completely childish behavior of the leftist media. This video perfectly illustrates how childish our media acts and how Sean Spicer responds to them, as though he’s talking to a group of kindergarten students.

WE THINK SEAN SPICER LEADS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FOR THE BEST ZINGERS – HERE ARE A FEW OF OUR FAVORITES:
The mainstream media is clearly a leftist clique united against the Trump administration. On Thursday, Spicer called on Simendinger during a heated press briefing.
Instead of asking her own question, Alexis snarked: “Could you help us all by calling on Peter right now? Could you call on the New York Times, please?”

“I know it’s frustrating for you that we’re doing it in a logical way,” – Sean Spicer to Allison Camerota",1
"The golden ratio—represented by the number 1.618 or the Greek letter for “phi”—occurs when the summation of two quantities is equal to the ratio of the quantity as a whole. It’s been used in architecture and art to create what was believed to be the most aesthetically pleasing designs that exhibited perfect symmetry and has also applied to measuring beauty in humans.
The above photo of a 2015 New Year’s Eve street scene of drunken revelers in Manchester has been compared to a Renaissance masterpiece. The image, shot by freelance news photographer Joel Goodman, depicts police wrestling a man in the foreground, as crowds look on. A man in blue reclines in the road while reaching for a nearby beer.
The image went viral, and the the golden spiral was placed on the photo to show that it was indeed a “perfect composition.” Goodman has taken his newfound fame in stride, saying that he was merely “in the right place at the right time.”
Is Trump’s popularity due to his “universal beauty”? Some people in Japan believe so.
Tocana—a Japanese news site for all things paranormal—recently theorized that 45’s popularity could be linked to the fact that his face fits the “golden ratio”—a mathematical measure of beauty.
It proclaimed that when the golden ratio and Trump’s profile photo are put together, “you can see that the ratio of the distance from his ear to the back side of his head and the length from top of his head to his forehead matches the golden ratio perfectly. It matches so perfectly that it makes us shudder.” (It makes us shudder too, but perhaps for different reasons.)
Using computer facial mapping technology, a London cosmetic surgeon measured the proportions of actor George Clooney’s face and calculated its proximity to the golden ratio sweet spot. It was pretty much on the money.
Clooney was determined to be a 91.86 % match to the 1.618 ratio, according to Dr. Julian De Silva, a Harley Street clinician. “He has beautiful facial symmetry and gets closer than any other man to having what the Greeks considered the perfect face,” De Silva said. Runners up include Bradley Cooper, Brad Pitt, Harry Styles and David Beckham.
Yes, the golden ratio also occurs in music! After Lady Gaga’s single “Perfect Illusion” dropped in September 2016, one focus of internet chatter has been on the song’s epic key change. It occurs at exactly the right moment (1:51 to be exact) to achieve the golden ratio, giving music theory nerds everywhere a reason to defend their love of Mother Monster.
Gaga is a Juilliard-trained pianist—she’s almost certain to learned the core mathematical principles involved in the creation of music.
Game of Thrones’ end may be near, but some things in Westeros are eternal—we’re talking about the enduring perfection of Jon Snow’s (Kit Harrington) butt. Fans of the King in the North’s behind were treated to a rare glimpse of his ample curvature when he had incestuous boat sex with Dany in the season 7 finale. If that wasn’t enough, the genius behind the Twitter account @FibonacciSpiral saw the laws of nature on…well, full….display. Snow’s butt, it seems, perfectly fits the golden spiral. In other words, his rear is eternal in its perfection.
2014 was a tense year for Ukrainian/Russian relations. So much so, that Parliament members and protesting members of the pro-Russian opposition movement duked it out in Parliament. Luckily, an anonymous Reuter’s photographer snapped away as fists flew, and out came this perfectly composed image. Imgur user tajanstvenix recognized the picture’s classical composition right away, and added the golden ratio to this “Parliamentary masterpiece.”
Twitter user @LydiaBurrell confirmed what the Japanese website Tocana theorized—that Donald Trump possesses a mathematical beauty that is hard to ignore. However, she didn’t find it it in his profile—instead, she found it in his behind. And how did the rest of Twitter respond, you ask?
A photograph of Justin Bieber being held by the throat by another man has caused a stir because of its perfect composition and likeness to a Renaissance painting.
The grainy image shows rapper Post Malone clutching the singer around the neck. Sure, the first thing people were curious about was the context (what had the Beebs done to warrant this action?), but art historians couldn’t help noticing the photo’s perfect composition, and the light, shade, and drama typical of 15th and 16th-century masters. Eagle-eyed Twitterers also agreed that the picture contains the “golden ratio,” after an image of the original photograph had the spiral superimposed on it.",1
"After the ouster of CEO Roger Ailes and now Bill O’Reilly, Fox News is reportedly set to take a turn to the left almost immediately under the “leadership” of Rupert Murdoch’s son, James Murdoch, who apparently seeks to create a globalist network and turn away from the conservatism that catapulted the network to the number one spot.
What’s happening? According to Michael Wolff in The Hollywood Reporter, Fox News is James Murdoch’s project now, and he wants to make the network an “ultimate global news brand” that will appeal to establishment-style elites.
So the opposite of what made it the number-one cable news network. That sounds par for the course in leftist land, which celebrates rejecting reality and failure.
It’s all about what it looks like. Wolff wrote:
After The New York Times wrote about the sexual harassment claims leveled at Fox News anchor Bill O’Reilly and the settlements made by the company and O’Reilly himself, James Murdoch, according to 21st Century Fox sources, kept repeating with horror to his friends and executives: “This is on the front page of The New York Times!”
These sources say James Murdoch’s longtime annoyance if not disgust with Fox News became cold fury after the Times‘ April 1 story — even though several of the O’Reilly settlements had happened when James was CEO of the parent company. This was a similar reaction to what had followed the harassment suit by former anchor Gretchen Carlson against Fox News chief Roger Ailes in July. Every time Fox controversies spilled over into the wider world, James took it personally. “It was somehow against him,” says one person close to the Murdochs.
James Murdoch’s elitism and foolishness. Wolff wrote, “Fox News is a business he should not be in, he had told people before, despite its major contribution to 21st Century Fox’s bottom line — 20 percent of its profits came from Fox News last year, the biggest-earning division in the company.”
“Presumably, he meant the in-your-face world of conservative cable news with its mega personalities. Indeed, James regarded many of the people at Fox News as thuggish Neanderthals and said he was embarrassed to be in the same company with them.”
But I’m sure he cashed the checks, and was only embarrassed, of course, when it was on the front page of leftist rags.
What does this mean? It appears, if this report is true, that James Murdoch is a typical regressive leftist that is more concerned with how things look and wants to go by the same playbook that the Democrats found out the American people were fed up with in 2016.
Fox News catapulted to the top because they provided somewhat of a counter-balance to the left-wing mainstream media.
Wolff wrote, “If the expulsion of Ailes, and, even more dramatically, O’Reilly, mean anything, it means most of all that James is in charge. And, most immediately, this means that Fox News, that constant irritant in James’ view of himself as a progressive and visionary television executive, will begin to change. Virtually overnight.”
As Wolff wrote, “Murdoch media, in an age of populist disruption, will stand for the established world order.”
It’s not terribly surprising, as Fox News wasn’t too warm toward Donald Trump during the election, and it has become clear for some time that the Murdochs weren’t too keen about the unwashed masses having a voice.",1

They did it by getting people to sit in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scanner, which measures real-time brain activity, and then asking them to think about tender moments.“You ask them to go back in their lives and identify moments that were very important for them in which they felt feelings of empathy and tenderness,” said Moll. He tried it himself, thinking about a time when he hugged his children. The feelings were so overwhelming, he said, that it was hard to distract himself.People were also asked to think about times when they felt pride in something they did, and to think neutral thoughts, also, such as remembering a recent trip grocery-shopping.“We wanted to measure very specific brain patterns,” Moll said. The computer program compared the brain activity of the three emotional states to map out patterns specific to tender, empathetic thoughts.You could use it to reduce unwanted feelings.You could use it to reduce unwanted feelings.Next, 25 volunteers were asked to try to control these thoughts and feelings. For the experiment, Moll’s team devised a ring-like image that would become more focused the more a volunteer’s brain patterns fit the template of empathetic feelings.As a control, some of the volunteers were told to focus their feelings, using randomly generated images of the rings that they were told represented nothing specific.“We ask them to try to hold the feeling, to feel it as strongly as possible,” Moll said.It worked. People who were given feedback on their brain patterns were able to strengthen them, Moll’s team reports in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE. “This demonstrates that humans can voluntarily enhance brain signatures of tenderness/affection, unlocking new possibilities for promoting prosocial emotions and countering antisocial behavior,” they wrote.The approach needs a lot of fine-tuning, Moll stresses. But he envisions helping people who are having trouble controlling angry or violent emotions. You could see a use for someone with antisocial personality disorder, he said. “You could use it to reduce unwanted feelings.”It might also help treat people with developmental conditions such as autism, some forms of which are marked by an inability to read and understand other peoples’ emotions.And Moll’s team is also working to study psychopaths, although he hasn’t tried the fMRI/biofeedback technique on one yet.“Maybe it wouldn’t work with a true psychopath, who never felt a droplet of tender feelings,” he said.But not all people have extreme symptoms, and it might help some people understand that reading and mirroring others’ emotions could work in their own self-interest.Let our news meet your inbox.MORE FROM better",0
"It isn’t exactly a bull in a china shop, but it’s close.
A wild peacock caused hundreds of dollars’ worth of damage after wandering into a Southern California liquor store on Monday — and the craziest part is, he wasn’t even drunk.
Rani Ghanem, the manager of Royal Oaks Liquors in Arcadia, Calif. claims that the colorful bird entered the store through the front door — which was propped open — but couldn’t seem to find its way out, reports the City News Service of Southern Calif.
SOUTHERN COMFORT WILL SOON CONTAIN ACTUAL WHISKEY
“A lady said, ‘Hey, uh, you have a bird inside your store,’” recalls Ghanem, who admitted to being at a loss over what to do next.
Ghanem also tellsCBS Los Angeles that the peacock, presumably in a panic, decided to fly directly at him.
""I didn’t know they could actually fly high, but it flew up above the counter and it landed here on top of the ice cream freezer,” explained Ghanem.
The peacock then settled atop the store’s wine shelves, where it apparently planned to settle in for the long haul. Ghanem even says that a number of patrons made purchases while the peacock watched from above, and a few of his braver customers even stopped to pose for pictures with it, as seen in the video footage below. (Warning: Language is slightly NSFW.)
COSTCO'S SIGNATURE LIQUORS ARE BOOSTING STORE'S BOTTOM LINE IN BIG WAY
“This was really out of my comfort zone,” added Ghanem, who can be seen wielding a broom in security camera footage of the incident. “I was kinda scared. I didn’t know what to do.”
Eventually, animal control services arrived to try and coax the peacock down from its perch by prodding it with a large net and they were successful … at first. The peacock jumped down to the store’s center display, thrashing across the top shelf and breaking $500 worth of champagne and wine bottles.
Animal control eventually captured the bird and removed it from the store, telling Ghanem that it would be released at the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanical Garden.

"More teens who are killing themselves are choosing suffocation and strangling, government researchers reported Thursday. And more young women are committing suicide.
It’s a troubling trend and it’s not clear what’s driving it, the team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
“The data don’t allow us to determine why,” said the CDC’s Thomas Simon, a suicide expert who helped lead the study. “Is it social media? Is it conventional media? Is it access to other methods?”
What CDC is very worried about is giving troubled a teens a ""how-to"" guide for how to commit suicide, but the agency also wants parents, teachers, friends and others to be aware of the risks. When media report on certain suicide methods, often officials see a rise in suicides afterwards, using the method described.
“Is it social media? Is it conventional media? Is it access to other methods?”
It’s also worrying because suffocation is lethal. Unlike attempts at poisoning, most suffocation attempts do end up killing the victim.
Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among children and young adults aged 10 to 24. In 2012, more than 5,000 teens and young adults died by suicide.
Simon’s team wanted to see if anything’s changed by race, sex, geography or method of death and looked at death reports from 1994 to 2012.
“Results of the analysis indicated that, during 1994–2012, suicide rates by suffocation increased, on average, by 6.7 percent and 2.2 percent annually for females and males, respectively,” they wrote in the CDC’s weekly report on death and illness.
Suicide rates overall went down among young men and boys from 1994 to 2007, but then headed back up again, the team found. Suicide rates for girls and women also rose after 2007.
“Among persons aged 10–24 years, suicide rates are higher in males than in females. Suicide rates by suffocation (including hanging) have been increasing among females in this age group since the early 1990s,” they wrote.
“It seems to be a pervasive pattern,” Simon told NBC News.
“If they are vulnerable, it is important not to leave that person alone.""
The findings make it more important than ever for people to be aware of the warning signs for suicide.
* Talking about feeling unbearable pain, or feeling like a burden to others
“If somebody is close to someone who is acting this way, it is OK to talk to them,” Simon said. “If they are vulnerable, it is important not to leave that person alone.""
In such cases, he advises calling the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-8255.
It’s also important to make sure troubled young people do not have access to lethal means, including guns, pills or ways to suffocate themselves. ""In institutions, hospitals, prisons, we are able to use methods like restricting access to materials that can be used for suffocation,” Simon said.
That’s harder to do in a home and makes it more important not to leave a troubled person alone, he said.",0

Journalists claim Kimmel is America's 'conscience,' NRA is 'terrorist,' and other awful media mistakes
In the aftermath of the worst mass shooting in American history, the news media turned to wisest among us to seek calm words that would unify a heartbroken nation.
Nah. They turned to newly promoted, left-wing hack and occasional funnyman Jimmy Kimmel. Kimmel, you’ll recall, served as the Democratic mouthpiece on ObamaCare recently. So he was all primed to do so again.
And he delivered an achingly embarrassing rant that journalists went nuts for. USA Today highlighted late-night show reaction calling for gun control under the headline: “If not now, then when?” The Washington Post bombarded readers with hot takes on Kimmel. Pop culture writer Emily Yahr called his comments an “emotional, scathing monologue about gun control” in one of the three separate stories she wrote about Kimmel’s monologue.
Post TV critic Hank Stuever agreed, adding: “Jimmy Kimmel is saying everything right.” He went on to discuss “a curious evolution process that turned late-night hosts into the nation’s moral conscience.” But remember, The Washington Post, D-Resist, is neutral.
Singing Kimmel’s praises became a journalism default. The New York Times conveniently used nearly identical phrasing, saying Kimmel was “acting as a social conscience as he called out politicians, the National Rifle Association and complacent citizens.” Even the sports site The Ringer tried this strategy, proclaiming that “Kimmel has become the voice that’s best encapsulated a large section of America’s conscience.”
CNN’s Bill Carter wrote an especially ridiculous piece under the headline: “How Jimmy Kimmel became America's conscience.” Carter’s piece read like a press release from Kimmel’s publicist: “Kimmel simply sounds like a regular guy making reasonable points – because he is a regular guy.”
Maybe he seems like a regular guy, but he’s not. Kimmel earns $10 million a year and has a net worth of about $35 million, according to Celebritynetworth.com. Everybody reading who’s a millionaire, raise your hands.
And with all the sudden pretense that Kimmel is such a moral leader, it might be good to recall the Jimmy Kimmel origin story. Kimmel built his career with jokes about genocide and promoting R. Kelly, who’s accused of sex with minors. And then there’s Kimmel’s time on “The Man Show,” where he urged young women to get on a trampoline and jump around to please the audience. Several even stripped, much to the pleasure of our new moral conscience.
The PR-ish Carter swallowed the Kimmel talking points 100 percent. Carter practically cheered Kimmel’s claim that “I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this. I just want to give you something to laugh about at night.""
Don’t believe a word of it. If Kimmel wanted to make us laugh, he could try. Instead, he had an agenda to push. Just like he did on ObamaCare. Just like all the other late-night hosts and most of TV – news or entertainment.
2. Media Push Gun Control, Attack NRA: The media have a pre-written script for gun stories – shift as soon as possible into a discussion of gun control and declare the National Rifle Association evil. Or worse.
GQ’s professional kook Keith Olbermann called the NRA “a terrorist organization” and the media ate it up. The Hill, HuffPost and Raw Story were just a few to highlight his comments, even though it’s been years since Olbermann has been anything other than a circus sideshow to American politics.
But Olbermann isn’t alone. Former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw came out against the NRA in full attack mode, urging citizens “to organize on the other side.” He even claimed if members of Congress run against the NRA “you’re portrayed as a traitor to America.”
New York Times theoretically conservative columnist Bret Stephens made a mockery of his credentials and called for a complete repeal of the Second Amendment. Claiming he “never understood the conservative fetish for the Second Amendment,” Stephens skewered most of what the left proposes for gun control. “Expansive interpretations of the right to bear arms will be the law of the land — until the ‘right’ itself ceases to be,” he argued.
MSNBC proven liar and anchor Brian Williams said he didn’t understand why the Sandy Hook shooting hadn’t resulted in more gun regulation. “Why don't we act? What is the problem? What was it about first graders losing their lives that wasn't sad enough to result in changes?” he asked. Fellow MSNBC host Joe Scarborough blamed ""extreme gerrymandering"" for NRA success. Apparently, he’s never heard of the Democratic gerrymander in Maryland.
And when the media weren’t pushing an agenda, they were busy being outright wrong about guns. The Free Beacon’s Stephen Gutowski could work 24-7 squashing these errors and barely make a dent. Gutowski summed it up nicely, writing: “There is no way around it: The news industry is incomprehensibly inept at reporting on guns.” He noted that only three news organizations cover the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives – the Washington Free Beacon, The Trace, and Guns.com.
3. Look to Hollywood to Learn How to Think Correctly: You don’t have to look far in Tinseltown to find stars saying all the right (left) things about guns. Singer Nancy Sinatra recommended that NRA members “should face a firing squad.” Public Enemy’s Chuck D echoed much of the left, describing the NRA as a “terrorist organization.” Comedian Michael Ian Black repeated an identical sentiment: “The NRA is a terrorist organization. There's no other way to say it.”
Hollywood was awash in such declarations. Perennial left-winger Michael Moore came out with a complete rewrite of the Second Amendment that essentially guts it and doesn’t even let owners keep guns in their homes. Britain’s Piers Morgan declared: “The NRA is killing America” and singer Lady Gaga said “there is blood on the hands of those who have the power to legislate.”
All of that makes perfect sense because we know that Hollywood never makes any movies with guns or gun violence in them. Never at all. Last year’s top 10 movies included four superhero flicks that feature tons of gun violence – including “Suicide Squad” and “Deadpool.” And 2017 is already shaping up to have the top 10 films also filled with gun violence. That is, after all, how Hollywood stars get paid.
4. ‘Decades of Sexual Harassment Accusations Against Harvey Weinstein’: That’s the actual headline of The New York Times piece on a Hollywood A-lister long-rumored to have a major dark side. The story is both horrifying and hard to put down. Weinstein has simultaneously apologized for having “caused a lot of pain,” and claimed he will sue the paper for $50 million.
The story begins with an anecdote featuring actress Ashley Judd being “asked if he could give her a massage or she could watch him shower.” The creep factor is about 112 on a scale of 1-10. ABC and CBS evening news shows covered the incredible story. NBC skipped it entirely.
In nearly three decades, “after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity,” wrote The Times.
Weinstein’s statement is especially bizarre, as he begs for forgiveness from left-wingers in Hollywood and offers them exactly what they want – war with the NRA. “I want a second chance in the community, but I know I’ve got work to do to earn it,” he wrote. A few sentences later, he vowed to go to war against the gun group. “I am going to need a place to channel that anger, so I’ve decided that I’m going to give the NRA my full attention. I hope Wayne LaPierre will enjoy his retirement party.”
Welcome to Hollywood, where you can rape a young girl and get an Oscar and a standing ovation, like Roman Polanski did. And you can be accused of decades of sexual harassment and try to buy yourself out of it by warring against the right.
And This Is Awful, Too: Some stories are worth noting, even if they didn’t garner a ton of media coverage. MSNBC lefty and political director Chuck Todd wants to build the wall. No, not the wall between the U. S. and Mexico. That’s too conservative. No, Todd wants to “reinforce the wall between the news media and the politicians.” That and more fun nuggets were included in Sunday’s New York Times Magazine piece with the hilarious headline: “Chuck Todd Thinks It’s Important to Stay Neutral.” Stop laughing.
Religion might be in the First Amendment, but it shouldn’t be near the National Mall, according to Washingtonian magazine. The mag ran an article on a new D.C. museum, with the bigoted headline: “The Museum of the Bible Will Probably Be a Big Hit. But It Doesn’t Belong Near the Mall.” Politics and Culture Editor Rob Brunner admitted: “I couldn’t help but feel a little uncomfortable with the whole endeavor.” He ended with a typically secular journalist comment: “The Museum of the Bible, well intentioned though it may be, feels like something of a violation.” That’s probably how most Christians feel when they read any news about faith.

The Russian parliament has announced it plans to investigate CNN, the Voice of America, and other U. S. media outlets “for compliance of their activities with Russian legislation,” according to a statement made by the parliament on its website Friday.
The State Duma, the lower house in the Russian parliament, ordered on Friday an investigation into whether U. S. media organizations operating in Russia are breaking any of the nation’s laws, according to a report by USA Today.
The investigation would be carried out by the Committee on Information Policy, Information Technology and Communications, a committee in the State Duma. According to multiple reports, CNN, Radio Liberty, and the Voice of America were singled out by the parliament, but other “U. S. media” will be investigated as well.
The decision was reportedly made in retaliation to a bill introduced by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N. H.) earlier this week. The bill wouldempower theDepartment of Justicewith more toolsto investigate state-owned Russian media outlet RT America for any violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
“We have good reason to believe that RT News is coordinating with the Russian government to spread misinformation and undermine our democratic process,” said Shaheen in a press release issued by her office. “The American public has a right to know if this is the case. RT News has made public statements boasting that it can dodge our laws with shell corporations, and it’s time for the Department of Justice to investigate. My bill provides the authority needed to request documentation of RT News and find out who they’re accountable to.”
The Russian parliament’s decision came just two days after U. N. Ambassador Nikki Haley told NBC News that Russian threats must be taken “seriously” and emphatically stated the Russian government is untrustworthy.
“We cannot trust Russia,” Haley said on Wednesday. “We should never trust Russia.”
Haley’s comments were made in response to news the Department of Justice issued charges against two Russian spies on Wednesday for their alleged role in the theft of data belonging to more than 500 million Yahoo users.",1
"WOW! This is a great news folks! Finally Trump team is taking control in federal government! Now we are expecting similar activities in CIA, NSA and FBI!

Many of those let go were on the building’s seventh floor — top-floor bigs — a symbolically important sign to the rest of the diplomatic corps that their new boss has different priorities than the last one.
GREAT JOB REX! That’s what we were expecting for so long! Now Trump should clean more the White House so there is not going to be more leaking.
We look as complete amateurs and losers to the world when presidents talks with world leaders are leaking out like candies! We are talking about our commander in chief, he should be protected under many layers of secrecy and professionalism.
We have to stop the leaking, Trump team have to unite all federal government behind Trump so that he could focus on his campaign promises!
Now he is being stabbed every day in the back, he is bleeding all day, this looks very bad now! Trump need help, he need supporters in the government, and his enemies out of the government!
He is going to manage all of this mess, he will win this, he is the best! He will who everybody that he is going to be the best president ever!!!",1
"The BBC Trust has reviewed the corporation’s regional radio output and, while stating it must remain relevant, said budgets had already been left ‘very tight’
The BBC Trust has reviewed the corporation’s regional radio output and, while stating it must remain relevant, said budgets had already been left ‘very tight’
The BBC has been warned against making further cuts to its local radio services by the BBC Trust, which said budgets had been left “very tight” by previous rounds of cost-cutting.
The BBC’s 39 local radio stations face the prospect of cuts as part of the corporation’s attempts to meet the 700m cost of free TV licence fees for the over-75s.
But a trust review of the BBC’s local news and current affairs services, including radio, TV and online, said they were “unique and highly valued”.
However, the report, published on Wednesday, said the BBC’s local offerings had to work harder to stay relevant in the digital age.
It said they were failing to reach sufficient black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) listeners and were “much more likely to be used by white audiences”.
The report also warned that its audiences were increasingly going online to find local news and information and said the BBC’s regional websites were seen as slow with fewer news stories.
The review comes at a time when BBC’s local radio services face further cuts. One option is said to be a merger with Radio 5 Live, with local radio stations retaining their own breakfast and drivetime stations. Both 5 Live and local radio have lost listeners in recent years.
But former 5 Live controller Roger Mosey warned earlier this week that such a merger would be a “shotgun marriage” and incompatible with the national station’s extensive sports portfolio.
The last time BBC local radio faced big cuts, four years ago, proposed savings of 15m were halved to 8m following protests from listeners and MPs, and opposition from the then-BBC Trust chairman, Lord Patten.
The trust asked local radio bosses to come back in six months’ time with how they plan to address the challenges in the report.
The review said the last round of cuts had been proportionately lower in local radio than other areas of the BBC but said it should be “protected where possible from further budget cuts due to its high public value and unique contribution”.
“While scope cuts cannot be ruled out in the future, we will need to see clear evidence that the value of this offer can be preserved if plans are made to cut its funding,” it added.
Despite recent cuts, the cost per listener of local radio has gone up because its audience has fallen in recent years.
At 3.8p per listener hour it is more expensive than any of the BBC’s big national networks (Radio 1 is 1.1p, 5 Live 2.5p) other than Radio 3 (6.4p).
Local radio reach fell by around 10% from 17.3% in 2010/11 to 15.5% in 2014/15 and shows no sign of slowing down. Among its target audience of over-50s, it fell by 11% over the same period from 26.9% to 23.9%.
The report said there was “nothing comparable” to the BBC’s local news and current affairs services in the commercial sector and its local radio stations were “unique in many respects”.
But it said they had to “evolve to remain relevant and appealing” and highlighted a number of challenges including the need to appeal more to BAME audiences.
Among its target audience of over-50s, local radio’s reach among BAME listeners is around half that of its white audience. Most BBC local station have specialist shows aimed at BAME listeners but have small audiences, it added.
The BBC spent 115.6m on local radio content in 2014/15, rising to 153.8m when distribution and infrastructure/support costs are included.",0

Megyn Kelly poses on the set of her new show “Megyn Kelly Today.” (Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)  During last month’s premiere of “Megyn Kelly Today,” the former Fox News anchor’s NBC morning show, Kelly avoided any mention of her past employer. But on Monday morning, Kelly shared some new details about her time at the cable channel, calling out Bill O’Reilly, Fox News and the network’shead of public relations for their treatment of employees who alleged sexual harassment at the company. Here’s the entire transcript of her remarks:   “O’Reilly’s suggestion that no one ever complained about his behavior is false. I know because I complained.” @megynkelly on Bill O’Reilly pic.twitter.com/BO8ifQcJbu     We begin today on a serious note, the news about Bill O’Reilly and Fox News. Have you seen it? It is shocking and it’s upsetting to many of us. I spent this weekend on the phone nonstop, talking to many women at Fox News and otherwise, who are deeplydisturbed over the latestNew York Times report. On Saturday, the Times revealed yet another settlement, paid to dispose of a sexual harassment case against O’Reilly. Not a huge shock there, we already knew of five, thanks to a Times report in April. But this latest one was for $32 million. Reportedly paid directly by O’Reilly to Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl, right before Fox News renewed his contract. Thirty-two million dollars.That is not a nuisance value settlement, that is a jaw-dropping figure. O. J. Simpson was ordered to pay the Goldman and Brown families $33.5 million for the murders of Ron and Nicole. What on earth would justify that amount? What awfulness went on? Wiehl reportedly alleging that she was subjected to nonconsensual sex by O’Reilly, which he denies. Watch.  In response to the New York Times, 21st Century Fox says that it has taken concerted action to transform Fox News, including hiring new leadership. O’Reilly calls theTimes reportsa malicious smear, claiming that no woman in 20 years ever complained to human resources or legal about him. Maybe that is true. Fox News was not exactly a friendly environment for harassment victims who wanted to report, in my experience. However, O’Reilly’s suggestion that no one ever complained about his behavior is false — I know because I complained. It was November of 2016, the day my memoir was released. In it, I included a chapter on Ailes and the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News — something the Murdochs knew I was doing and, to their credit, approved. O’Reillyhappened to be on CBS News that morning. They asked him about my book and about Ailes, who by this time had been forced out in disgrace.O’Reilly’s response:  O’Reilly: “I’m not that interested in this.”  O’Reilly: “I’m not interested in basically litigating something that is finished, that makes my network look bad. Okay? I’m not interested in making my network look bad. At all. That doesn’t interest me one bit.”) I did something that day I’ve never done before. I wrote an email to the co-presidents of Fox News, Bill Shine and Jack Abernathy — an email I have never made public but am sharing now because I think it speaks volumes about powerful men and the roadblocks one can face in taking them on. I wrote, in part, “Perhaps he didn’t realize the kind of message his criticism sends to young women across this country, about how men continue to view the issue of speaking out about sexual harassment. Perhaps he didn’t realize that his exact attitude of shaming women into shutting the hell up about harassment on grounds that it will disgrace the company is part of how Fox News got into the decade-long Ailes mess to begin with. Perhaps it’s his own history of harassment of women, which has, as you both know, resulted in payouts to more than one woman, including recently. That blinded him to the folly of saying anything other than ‘I am just so sorry for the women of this company, who never should have had to go through that.’” Bill Shine called me in response to my email, promising to deal with O’Reilly. By 8 p.m. that night, O’Reilly had apparently been dealt with. And by that, I mean he was permitted, with management’s advance notice and blessing, to go on the air and attack the company’s harassment victims yet again.  O’Reilly: “If somebody is paying you a wage, you owe that person or company allegiance. You don’t like what’s happening in a workplace? Go to human resources or leave. I’ve done that. And then take the action you need to take afterward if you feel aggrieved. There are labor lawyers in this country. But don’t run down the concern that supports you by trying to undermine it.”) This is not unique to Fox News. Women everywhere are used to being dismissed, ignored or attacked when raising complaints about men in authority positions. They stay silent so often out of fear. Fear of ending their careers. Fear of lawyers, yes. And often fear of public shaming, including through the media. At Fox News, the media relations chief Irena Briganti is known for her vindictiveness. To this day, she pushes negative articles on certain Ailes accusers, like the one you are looking at right now. It gives me no pleasure to report such news about my former employer, which has absolutely made some reforms since all of this went down. But this must stop. The abuse of women, the shaming of them, the threatening and the retaliation, silencing of them after the fact, it has to stop. Up next, Juliet Huddy, who was on air at Fox News for 20 years — speaking out for the first time since she accused Bill O’Reilly of sexually harassing her.
A new video series from The Washington Post",0
"The public is not being told the truth about what really went down in Las Vegas. As you will see below, the evidence is mounting that there were multiple shooters and that this was an operation that was planned well in advance. But according to the mainstream media, a 64-year-old retired accountant with a flabby physique that had no military training whatsoever and that wasn’t very experienced with guns was able to pull the whole thing off all by himself. We are being told that Paddock was a “lone wolf” that didn’t have any ties to terror groups, and since he is now dead nobody is ever going to be able to interrogate him. But the American people definitely deserve some answers about what took place, and that means that all of us should keep digging.
The following are 16 unanswered questions about the Las Vegas shooting that the mainstream media does not want to talk about…
#1 Photos of Stephen Paddock’s hotel room have been leaked, and one of those photos appears to show a suicide note. Why hasn’t the public been told what is in that note?
#2 Were there additional shooters? A taxi driver clearly captured video of an automatic weapon being fired out of a lower level window. A video from another angle and brief footage captured by Dan Bilzerian also seem to confirm that automatic gunfire was coming from a floor much lower than the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock was located on. And if you weren’t convinced by the first three videos, this fourth video should definitely do it.
#3 Why were law enforcement authorities discussing “another suspect on the fourth floor”, and why isn’t the mainstream media talking about this?
#4 As Jon Rappoport has pointed out, it would have been impossible for Stephen Paddock to kill and wound 573 people in less than five minutes of shooting with the kinds of weapons that he is alleged to have used. So why won’t law enforcement authorities acknowledge this fact?
#5 How in the world did Paddock get 42 guns and “several thousand rounds of ammo” into his hotel room without anyone noticing?
#6 How did someone with “no military background” and that wasn’t a “gun guy at all” operate such advanced weapons? Because what we are being told by the mainstream media just doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. I really like how Natural News made this point…
Far from what the firearms-illiterate media claims, these are not systems that any Joe off the street can just pick up and use to effortlessly mow down 500 people. Running these systems requires extensive training, experience and stamina. It is physically impossible for a guy like Stephen Paddock to operate such a system in the sustained, effective manner that we witnessed, especially when shooting from an elevated position which throws off all the ranging of the weapon system.
Far from being a Navy Seal, Stephen Paddock is a retired accountant senior citizen with a gambling problem and a flabby physique. The only way he could have carried out this shooting is if he were transformed into a human superweapon through a magic wand. I’m calling this “Mission IMPOSSIBLE” because of the physical impossibility of a retired, untrained senior citizen pulling this off.
#7 Why was one woman telling people in the crowd that they were all going to die 45 minutes before the attack?
#8 Why did it take law enforcement authorities 72 minutes to get into Stephen Paddock’s hotel room?
#9 Why did Paddock wire $100,000 to the Philippines last week?
#10 Why was Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, inthe Philippines when the attack took place? Did she know what was about to happen?
#11 Was Paddock on antidepressants like so many other mass killers in the past have been?
#12 Why was ISIS so eager to take responsibility for this attack, and why was the FBI so quick to dismiss that connection?
#13 Apparently Paddock had earned millions of dollars “through real estate deals”. If he was so wealthy, why would he all of a sudden snap like that?
#14 Why did he move so frequently? It is being reported that Paddock had 27 different residences during his adult life.
#15 Why were nearly all of the exits out of the concert venue completely blocked?…
In essence, the concert trapped the people, preventing them from escaping, and denying them the ability to seek cover. From there, sustained, full-auto gunfire is almost impossible to survive.
From Fox News, a caller named Russell Bleck, who survived the shooting, said live on air, “There were ten-foot walls blocking us in. We couldn’t escape. It was just a massacre. We had nowhere to go.”
#16 Why was a country music festival chosen as the target? Was the goal to kill as many Trump supporters and other conservatives as possible? And is there evidence that Stephen Paddock was connected to Antifa in any way?
At first I thought that this was a fairly straightforward story too, but the more I have dug into it the more complex things have become.
Personally, I have come to the conclusion that Stephen Paddock definitely did not act alone. That means that the others involved in the shooting are still out there, and they must be brought to justice. Let us never forget what these extremely wicked individuals did to innocent civilians such as 27-year-old Tina Frost…
A 27-year-old woman has lost her right eye after a bullet ripped through her face during the Las Vegas concert massacre.
Tina Frost remains in a coma in hospital after undergoing surgery to remove the bullet that became lodged in her eye when a gunman opened fire on the crowd of country music fans on Sunday night.
Frost, who is originally from Maryland but moved to California several years ago, is expected to remain in the coma for a week.
Whoever did this is going to pay greatly. Yes, I do believe that Stephen Paddock was involved. But he did not act alone, and the mainstream media is doing the public a great disservice by ignoring all of the evidence that this was not just a “lone wolf” operation.",1

Pacific Ocean Warned Will Turn To Blood After Japan Nuclear Disaster Breaches Gates Of Hell
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
A truly alarming research article circulating in the Kremlin today written by doctor-scientists from the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring Ministry (ROSGIDROMET) warns that the entire Pacific Ocean region (that comprises one-third of the Earths surface) is in danger of being subsumed by two marine species of red algae whose exponential growth has now been accelerated due to a never before known internal planet atmosphere being released as a result of the 11 March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Disaster in Japanand that if not mitigated, will cause this massive water body to turn blood red, kill everything within it, and make it unnavigable.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this article, ROSGIDROMET doctor-scientists are the Federations experts on hydrometeorology [a branch of meteorology and hydrology that studies the transfer of water and energy between the land surface and the lower atmosphere] whose main/central focus of study is on what are called atmospheric riversthat they describe as narrow corridors of concentrated moisture in the atmosphere which are typically several thousand kilometers long and only a few hundred kilometers wide.
Past research projects for the benefit of the Federation of ROSGIDROMET, this article explains, has been in the guidance/control of these atmospheric rivers in an effort to effectuate positive controls (precipitation) over certain oblasts and territories (regions) suffering from drought. (e.g., cloud seeding, weather manipulation)
Working closely with the Ministry of Defense (MoD) in their drought mitigation efforts, this article continues, in 2011, shortly after the Japanese nuclear disaster at Fukushima, ROSGIDROMET doctor-scientists were given access to the MoDs Luch-class satellite data over the Pacific Ocean region in order to track/monitor the airborne spread of radiationmost particularly how this radiation would/could affect atmospheric rivers.
On 31 January, however, this article notes, satellite data received by ROSGIDROMENT doctor-scientists began to record abnormally high levels of radioactive sulfur emanating from Fukushima, and that was followed two days later, on 2 February, with Japanese authorities reporting that two of their radiation protected robots had been destroyed, and even more concerning, their discovery of a mysterious hole measuring 2 meters in diameter within the metal grating at the bottom of the containment vessel in this nuclear plant's No. 2 reactor.
While these abnormally high radioactive sulfur readings emanating from Fukushima were of great/heavy concern to ROSGIDROMENT doctor-scientists, this article states, what followed this past week, on 23 February, raised these concerns to an unprecedented level when these readings exploded off of the chartsbut with Japanese authorities only admitting that a mysterious fire had broken out at this crippled nuclear plant, and them giving no further information about.
In describing the levels of radioactive sulfur being spewed from Fukushima and beginning to circle the globe, this article says, ROSCIDROMENT doctor-scientists could only explain it as the gates of hell being opened as no modern scientific literature has ever theorized about such enormous levels of sulfur being present in the deepest parts of Earthand leading one of these doctor-scientists to suggest that a China Syndrome event had occurred where the Fukishima nuclear material had melted down to an ancient deposit of atmospheric sulfur never known about before.
To the dangers of such catastrophic levels of radioactive sulfur being spewed into the atmosphere, this article warns, is due to the airborne nature of algaemost dangerously a marine species of red algae discovered in Japan, in 2014, called Congracilaria Babae that when exposed to radiation has explosive growthand like all other marine species of algae thrive on sulfur.
Even worse, this article says, was that in 2010, a discovery was made showing that a marine species of red algae called Plocamiocolax Puvinata had lost a key gene to stop it from rapidly replicatingand that was further discovered, too, in the marine species of red algae called Plocamium Pacificum.
Critical to note about the Plocamium Pacificum marine species of red algae, this article continues, is that is an intertidal and subtidal alga found all along the Western coastlines of North America in the mid to low intertidal zone and sub-tidally to depths of 40 metersmeaning that as it grows and spreads, destroying oxygen levels and killing everything in its path, it remains hiddenbut whose effects were beginning to be felt by 2015 with the collapse of this regions entire fishing industry due to mass die-offs, and many other strange anomalies occurring too.

But to the greatest fears of ROSCIDROMENT doctor-scientists, this article explains, is the combining of the Japanese marine species of red algae Congracilaria Babae with its North Americas west coast DNA-sibling Plocamium Pacificumand that should this happen, especially with the Pacific Oceans atmospheric rivers being inundated with massive quantities of radioactive sulfur from Japans newly opened  gates of hell, a red algae catastrophic event would occur turning all waters it touches into blood red death zonesand that not only would affect the ocean, but even into inland areas where these atmospheric rivers flow and precipitate as rain and snow.
And as if this ROSCIDROMENT research article isnt frightening enoughthese doctor-scientists made it even more scary (apocalyptic in fact) by having the Department for External Church Relations (DECR) write an addendum to their findings in order to find out if there were any historical-religious counterparts that could be examined so that more clarity/insight could be gained.
The DECR, of course, obliged these ROSCIDROMENT doctor-scientists, and in their over 300 page addendum to this scientific research article noted that the Holy Scriptures did, in fact, predict a future time when one-third of the worlds waters would be turned blood redand who citied as their evidence two passages from The Book Revelations: And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. and- The third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
DECR religious experts in this addendum further note that the Holy Scripture words fountains of water as used in this Book of Revelations warning are comprised of the ancient Greek words phgh (πηγζω) and udwr (δωρ)and that when combined, form the meaning of water of the deluge from where this blood red water will come fromand that matches the historical accounts of Noahs Flood where it rained for 40 days and 40 nights flooding the entire worldand whose water came from what we know now as atmospheric rivers. [Note: At any moment, the atmosphere contains an astounding 37.5 million-billion gallons of water, in the invisible vapor phase.]
As to the previously unknown existence to modern science of an internal planet atmosphere of sulfur, DECR religious experts in their addendum to this research article further state that this has long been known, and written, about by all of Earths most ancient peopleand in Christianity is a deep underground realm called Hell, Sheol and/or Gehenna,
This ROSGIDROMET research article concludes with these doctor-scientists giving no prediction for when their worst fears might be realized, and as seemingly echoed by DECR experts in their addendum who just simply note that every day God expects us all to remain watchful for these thingsand that, at least to us, sounds like good advice.

Final Battle For The World Begins: But Will Trumpian Forces Unite?
Return To Main Page",1
"Joannah was on a romantic getaway in Puerto Rico last summer with her then-boyfriend Dr. Gregory Konrath, a prominent Indiana orthopedic surgeon, enjoying a few cocktails at their hotel bar, when the conversation turned to murder.
""This is the most beautiful place in the whole world to hear the most terrifying thing you've ever heard,"" Joannah told ABC News' ""20/20"" in an exclusive interview.
Joannah, who asked that ABC News not use her last name, said Konrath had talked about murdering Ana Konrath, his ex-wife and the mother of their three children, once before on the trip, so when he brought it up again, she reached for her cell phone and started secretly recording him. Ana Konrath declined to comment for this report.
""He had had a few drinks and we're on the top floor of the hotel… and he starts talking about Ana ... and how he's planned this for over a year,"" Joannah said. ""I decide I'm going to record this because I mean, I don't know… I didn't want him to kill the mother of his children.""
For the next 23 minutes, Joannah recorded Konrath as he laid out in great detail what sounded to her like a chilling murder plot, and how he said he planned to make it look like a suicide.
""One choice is to do it in the bedroom… if for some reason the kids woke up, there's lots of ways to get out,"" Konrath is heard saying on Joannah's recording. ""Take an unmarked gun that has no prints with bullets already planted in her house, which they are… because she shoots herself in the head, she kills herself.""
""If I'm not on-call, I [can't] bring my cell phone because that's traceable,"" Konrath continues. ""Suspicion would fall immediately on me, the ex-husband… she has a million-dollar life insurance policy. I'm the beneficiary.""
Konrath went on to explain how he already had been very careful with the gun he wanted to use as the murder weapon.
""I never touched it with my hands,"" he says. ""Even when I took it to a shooting range, I wore latex gloves… after I do that… I put her prints on the bullets, close it, put her prints on the handle.""
He even went on to lay out the challenges of killing his ex-wife.
""One thing I don't know is, is she going to ------- slump down and die right there, that would be ideal, but maybe she'll writhe around and start making noise,"" Konrath says. ""I've done a lot of research on that, that's why I switched my phone by the way. I used it to research it and then, you know, nothing is traceable.""
Konrath also had calculated the risks of killing his ex at her home.
""I already drove over there twice … ready to go, and both times something happened,"" he said, adding that he had already ""pre-arranged messages"" to her family informing them of Ana's ""suicide.""
Joannah, a nurse who is also divorced with children, met Konrath through the dating website, OurTime.com. They moved in together after dating for four months and had been dating for almost a year when he took her on vacation to Puerto Rico. She had hoped they would get married, and said they had looked at wedding rings and had already purchased a wedding dress.
But after Konrath revealed what appeared to be a violent plot that he had been hatching to kill his ex-wife, Joannah said she was upset, and secretly plans to race back to Indiana without him.
""He wasn't just blowing off steam,"" she said. ""He talked about buying a gun and hiding it and where he was going to do it and how he was going to do it and how her body was going to fall and he had done research.""
Joannah said Konrath said he confided in her because she said he wanted her to tell the police he was with her so that she ""could be his alibi.""
Then Joannah started asking Konrath questions that seemed to catch him off guard. Joannah is heard on the recording saying to Konrath that he needed to think about money, and to ""set everybody up."" Then she asked him if they could get married before he kills his ex.
Joannah told ""20/20"" she was only focusing on her well-being and wanted to make sure he would look after her financially if he decided to go through with this alleged plot. But, Joannah claims she had always planned to turn the recording over to police, which she did.
In an interview with ""20/20"" from jail, Konrath said all that talk about killing his ex-wife was just a ""dark fantasy"" and ""a lot of it is drunken BS.""
""We were right on the beach… it's vacation, so I was drinking a fair amount,"" Konrath said in an exclusive interview. ""Then I just told her about this kind of, I guess, dark fantasy that I had about killing Ana.""
""I have never seriously hurt anybody,"" he continued. ""And I don’t have any desire to kill somebody in real life. So if you talk to me about would I want to kill Ana when I am sober, I would say, 'No, I don’t want to.' And not only that, but I am not gonna take a chance on my life being wasted by an attempt.""
Konrath is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence in Indiana, but it is not because he was convicted of attempted murder. It's for an entirely different reason. Watch ABC News' ""20/20"" HERE to find out why.",0
"Citing an exclusive report by The Daily Caller News Foundation’s investigative group, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh voiced frustration thatDemocrats are sidestepping media attention due topotentialimproprieties.
FBI agents recentlyseized smashed computer hard drivesfrom the home of Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s information technology (IT) administrator, according to sources. The Pakistani-born longtime IT aide to the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairwoman whoresigned in disgracehas since tried to retrieve the hard drives. Limbaugh noted and lamented that many of the popular news outlets have hardly touched the story.
“Here we got leaks, and here we’ve got ‘sources with knowledge of the investigation’ talking about Democrats,” Limbaughsaid. “Well, The Daily Caller’s been the only ones on it. I mean, they’re the ones who did that story two weeks ago. They revived it a bit today. But nobody’s picking up on this.It makes sense. This is the exact kind of story the Democrats and the Drive-By Media would want to ignore.”
Limbaugh notes how much of the clamoring over allegations ofmisconduct is centered on Republicans, specifically the Trump administration, even though, to him, thereappears to be a lot of conjecturing and little evidence.
“Exactly what they’re claiming happened with Trump and Russia and all this, it actually did happen with the Democrats!” the political personality said. “Their server was hacked; they wouldn’t turn the servers and any of the network equipment over to the FBI for forensic analysis. Instead, the IT aide to Debbie ‘Blabbermouth’ Schultz and three of his family members were working on IT for a number of Democrats in the House, and the FBI has seized computer hard drives from this guy.”
Limbaugh admits that, while there are no clear indicationsof what could be on the aforementioned hard drives (at least yet), it could be fairly damningnot only because the IT worker desperately wants them back, but also because there was overt evidence of the DNC rigging the 2016 election against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
“I think this is what Trump was talking about when he sends out that tweet wondering why Republicans and his ‘beleaguered’ attorney general are not investigating all of this,” said Limbaugh.
“Because whereas there’s probably nothing to find in terms of what’s being alleged about Trump,” Limbaugh concluded, “there’s a gold mine to be found among the Democrats, particularly over at the Democratic National Committee.”

"Style     Review  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events     An underwear model and his pals just dropped the year’s best country album         Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.    You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.
More than a few years ago, I was sitting on a tour bus with one of Nashville’s leading men, wondering if great country singers idolize great movie stars. This guy had the range of an Oscar nominee — a voice and a vibe flexible enough to tackle heartsickness (not easy), family manliness (not easier), comedy (treacherous) and even patriotism (almost impossible to pull off without sounding like an opportunist). When I finally asked him whether he’d ever thought of himself as an actor, he calmly and firmly insisted that he’d only ever been himself. He was radiating a golden aura of sincerity, but who knows. He could have been lying to my face. The fact that I couldn’t tell probably answered my question. Years later, I doubt the guys in Midland — a rising Texas trio with a fantastic new album — would flinch at that kind of Hollywood talk. Frontman Mark Wystrach is a former Calvin Klein underwear model so preposterously hot you’ve already stopped reading this sentence to go Google him. Bassist Cameron Duddy is an actor from California, not to mention the director of the music video for Bruno Mars’s “24K Magic.” Guitarist Jess Carson used to run a vintage clothing shop in Portlandia. So yeah, Midland’s attempt to brand itself as a troupe of honky-tonk road dogs smells dubious, but if you make it a dealbreaker, you’ll be missing out on the year’s best country album. It’s called “On the Rocks,” and the whole thing sounds about as tight as the inseam of Dwight Yoakam’s blue jeans — but you might hear a pinch of Moe Bandy and a splash of Juice Newton in there, too. As for the band’s lyric sheet, it’s riddled with contradictions that you won’t even notice. This music is so smooth, so handsome, so stylish and so bright, the band ends up getting away with everything. Early in the tracklist, Wystrach shoots a fire-starting wink across the dance floor, claiming, “There’s not enough love in the world, so we should make a little.” But later on, he’s exhausted, crooning over a breezy jangle about how “this old heart needs a break.” And who knows how these guys find chemical relief out in the real world. Their vocal harmonies are far too pretty to account for secondhand carcinogens inhaled in “Burn Out.” And despite the weed cravings expressed during “Altitude Adjustment,” I’d bet cash money that Midland’s rehearsal space smells more like Burberry cologne and sandalwood aromatherapy candles than kush and Bugles. Intentional or not, this album makes an important point: It shouldn’t matter whether a country artist sings from the depths of their experience or the margins of their imagination. And when the songs are this eloquent, this alive, it doesn’t. Especially not during “Drinkin’ Problem,” a barfly anthem worthy of a spot in country music’s great book of sorrow-drowners. The hook is funny like a boardwalk T-shirt (“People say I got a drinkin’ problem, but I got no problem drinkin’ at all”), but the second verse goes grim (“Last call gets later and later/I come in here so I don’t have to hate her” ). That’s a heavy mood swing for such a light song, but it feels familiar. We all do this kind of acting in real life. We yuk-yuk through our pain; we delude ourselves about our ugly habits. Meantime, somebody call Wystrach a cab. Ask if they can drop him off at the Academy Awards.

"VEDANTAM: Maybe your mornings sound like this.
VEDANTAM: You wake up to your alarm ringing. You turn it off and bring your phone back to bed with you. You scroll through email and social media, squinting through one eye to see what you've got to get done and what's happening in the news. When you finally get up and start getting ready, maybe you have some music going.
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: And we continue to follow that breaking news in south Charlotte...
VEDANTAM: Many of us are voracious consumers of information, and we're always looking for new ways to take in even more.
ALEXA: In Charlotte, N. C., it's 63 degrees with mostly sunny skies.
VEDANTAM: But even as we savor good news about the weather or the stock market or weekend plans, we're also regularly confronted by stuff that's unpleasant.
SIMULATED VOICE: To listen to your unread voicemails, press one.
VEDANTAM: Unpleasant information creates a paradox for the brain. This kind of information is often very important.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: This is the principal calling from your son's school. Please contact us so we can arrange a time to discuss your son's behavior.
VEDANTAM: But this kind of information also produces psychic pain. And one of the oldest rules in the brain is to avoid things that are painful.
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: This is the doctor's office. Your test results have come in. Pleas call us back immediately.
VEDANTAM: The tension between what we rationally know to be important and what we emotionally experience as painful is the subject of our episode today.
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Hey, just call me back as soon as you get this. I've - OK, I saw your wife kissing somebody. Sorry. Just give me a call.
VEDANTAM: It's about why we sometimes...
VEDANTAM: ...Shut it all out. Why we look away and the consequences of doing so, this week on HIDDEN BRAIN.
VEDANTAM: There's an old theory in economics about information. It goes like this. You should always be willing to hear information about your finances or your health. For example...
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Hey, Antonio (ph), help yourself to anything in the fridge. But heads up, sniff the milk first. I think it's getting close to the expiration date.
VEDANTAM: Maybe this information is useful. Maybe it's not.
VEDANTAM: No matter how you feel about the information, there's one thing you should never do.
JOSHUA TASOFF: A person should never avoid information because information can never hurt a decision.
VEDANTAM: Josh says less is never more when it comes to information. We always should want to know if our 401(k) is about to take a nosedive or if we're at risk of contracting a disease. But here's the thing. Humans aren't always rational. And when it comes to information...
TASOFF: Information can be anxiety-provoking. It can be depressing.
VEDANTAM: What do we do when something makes us sad or depressed? We turn away from it. When the thing that's depressing is information, we say, I don't want to hear about it. Social scientists call this behavior information aversion. More commonly, it's called the ostrich effect. The term comes not from birds, but investors.
TASOFF: So when the stock market goes down, people check their portfolio less frequently than when the stock market is going up.
VEDANTAM: And why would that be?
TASOFF: Well, the interpretation is that the information causes sort of an immediate pain just from hearing it, right? People are anticipating sort of their future losses. Of course, they don't actually have any losses yet. But they're anticipating those future losses, and that causes an emotional pains - obtaining that information.
VEDANTAM: Information aversion is one of many, many domains where human behavior seems to deviate from the models of economists. Instead of doing the rational thing, learning as much as possible about something, many of us do the opposite. We stick our heads in the sand. And this is true for more than just financial information. A couple of months ago, we asked HIDDEN BRAIN listeners to call in and tell us about their news consumption.
NANCY WALTER: Hello, my name is Nancy Walter (ph).
JASON FLAKES: Hi, Shankar. This is Jason Flakes (ph).
VEDANTAM: Jason, Nancy and Annie are all addicted to the news.
WALTER: My husband and I are news junkies.
FLAKES: I love listening to the news every day.
ANNIE: Checking it every few hours.
VEDANTAM: Or at least, they were addicted to the news until Donald Trump caught them by surprise and won the 2016 presidential election.
WALTER: I hadn't anticipated Donald Trump winning. So I went on a complete news blackout.
FLAKES: Just because of the frustration that I was feeling.
ANNIE: And actually had a lot of anxiety because of it. I have dramatically changed the way I read the news following the election.
VEDANTAM: These listeners had their fingers on the pulse of political news before the election, when Hillary Clinton appeared to be poised for victory. But in the days and weeks after Trump's surprising win, Jason, Nancy and Annie began to avoid the news. It was like the investors who stare lovingly at their portfolios when the stock market's on the rise but avoid looking whenever the market dips. Headlines about the Trump administration stressed these listeners out. It caused them pain. And that's a key marker of information aversion.
Now, there are times when people avoid information when it's simply too much to digest. Let's say you're studying for a big test. And after hours and hours of reading, you close your textbooks and take a break. This is information overload. You're burnt out from taking in so much stuff. With information aversion, the driver isn't that there's too much information. It's that the information is unpleasant. If you were to tell these people about pleasant things, they'd be glad to listen all day.
TASOFF: People want information - want more information about happier future experiences than less happy future experiences.
VEDANTAM: Josh wanted to see how much people prefer happy information to unpleasant information. He wanted to test that age-old theory, you should always be willing to hear information about your finances or your health. So he teamed up with a colleague.
VEDANTAM: And he asked participants to come in and sit at a desk for 20 minutes.
TASOFF: And posted in - at their cubicle in front of them were two envelopes - one labeled big and one labeled small.
VEDANTAM: They told the volunteers that there was a 10 percent chance the envelopes were filled with cash.
TASOFF: But if the big envelope contains money, it contains $100. If the small envelope contains money, it contains $10.
VEDANTAM: The volunteers would get to open the envelopes at the end of 20 minutes and pocket the contents. Now, if 20 minutes was too long to wait, Josh and Ananda said the volunteers could pay money to open one of the envelopes immediately.
VEDANTAM: Did you actually physically observe the volunteers? Did you notice anything as they were dealing with this? Could you actually see the dilemma on their faces?
GANGULY: Yeah. They were in the computer - they were in a computer lab and doing this. And absolutely, I mean, there was - it was almost like in a casino. But immediately, they would start tearing the envelopes open and immediately very excited about it. And, you know, F-words would fly.
VEDANTAM: (Laughter) And would F-words fly once they'd open the envelopes or before?
GANGULY: After they opened the envelopes (laughter) - it's the disappointment or the surprise.
VEDANTAM: Here's the trick in the experiment. Remember that there were two envelopes - one big, one small. Big envelopes carry the potential of a big sum of money. Small envelopes carry the potential of a small sum of money. You can guess which ones the volunteers wanted to open.
TASOFF: What we find is that people are twice as likely to open up the big envelope over the small envelope. The interpretation is that winning $100 is a lot more happy and a lot more exciting than winning $10. And so people's demand for that information, even though it's completely useless in their decision-making, is much higher.
VEDANTAM: I'm not sure I fully followed that. Walk me through that again.
TASOFF: Well, the information here is completely useless for making any decisions. So no matter what, they're going to get this money or not get the money, right? But they're just going to sit there for 20 minutes. And so receiving this information, unlike, you know, other decisions in our life, like - and you could think in our daily life, if you're going to get a raise or anything like this - that information can be very useful because it'll help you improve your purchase decisions right now in the present.
But here, they're basically stuck sitting in the lab in a seat. And so receiving this information 20 minutes earlier is completely useless. They can't use it to make - improve any decisions in that short interim period.
VEDANTAM: Even if receiving the information earlier was useless, lots of volunteers were perfectly willing to pay to find out what was inside the envelope sooner. The bigger the potential good news, the more likely volunteers were to pay. The studies show that people are hungry for information when information is pleasant. Now, there's one important detail we haven't told you yet. The amount of volunteers had to pay wasn't very much - just 50 cents to open an envelope. Since the big envelope could hold as much as $100, you might say that paying 50 cents was a trivial cost.
TASOFF: We wanted to look at something that had greater real-world stakes.
VEDANTAM: We know people want pleasant information. But are they willing to pay to avoid unpleasant news, like information about a disease? Josh and Ananda decided to find out. They thought about the health concerns you might see on a college campus.
TASOFF: The sample that we have access to are college undergrads, right? And so we could do something like a cancer test, but I don't think college undergrads are terribly concerned about that. I think what college undergrads tend to be typically concerned about is STDs.
VEDANTAM: STDs - sexually transmitted diseases. One of the most stigmatized and common diseases on college campuses is herpes. It's caused by the herpes simplex virus, or HSV.
GANGULY: We chose HSV because the prevalence - the rate of prevalence of HSV in this population is rather high. I mean, rough numbers are around 50 percent. Chances are every other person has it. So they would have it. And then the other attractive thing of - about HSV for us is it had this kind of two levels, kind of parallel to our $10 - $10 and $100 thing.
TASOFF: There's herpes simplex virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2. Herpes simplex virus 1 is typically associated with cold sores. And herpes simplex virus 2 is typically associated with genital herpes.
GANGULY: HSV-1, that's the oral herpes, is less - considered to be less severe or less stigmatic or whatever in the population.
VEDANTAM: Ananda and Josh asked college students to come back to their lab. This time, volunteers were asked to sit through a webinar about herpes.
GANGULY: We actually gave them photographs of sores on the lips and photographs of sores on male and female genitalia with a discussion of HSV-1 and HSV-2.
VEDANTAM: And these pictures were graphic?
GANGULY: These pictures were very graphic. In fact, we don't know that we'll be able - we want to put it in the paper. They were completely clinical graphic.
VEDANTAM: Since Josh and Ananda knew that some people avoid getting tested for herpes because they don't want to deal with a blood test, volunteers were told they had to have their blood drawn in order to stay in the study. The researchers told volunteers they could have the blood tested for free for both kinds of herpes. Volunteers were assured confidentiality.
GANGULY: They were allowed to call into the lab with their initials and four randomly selected numbers of their own choice. Even the doctor would not know who they were.
VEDANTAM: So to recap, students were given graphic information about two forms of herpes. The researchers then proceeded to eliminate all the usual reasons someone might not want to get tested for the sexually transmitted disease. It was mandatory for the volunteers to get their blood drawn. The test was free, and the results would be obtained confidentially.
Would volunteers elect to find out if they had herpes, or would they choose to bury their heads in the sand? To test for information aversion, the researchers told the volunteers that they would have to pay $10 to not get their blood tested. A significant number of volunteers elected to pay this money. And just as the researchers had expected, volunteers were more likely to pay money to avoid getting highly unpleasant information about genital herpes than the less unpleasant information about oral herpes.
Tell me about those people. So they just - did that happen in front of them? Or how did that happen?
GANGULY: So the phlebotomist drew the blood. And we said, OK, so this was your choice. You had chosen not to be tested. So now this blood would be discarded. Would you please drop it down the sink and wash it up?
VEDANTAM: And they did.
GANGULY: They did. They would drop the tube into the sink and turn on the faucet, and it would go.
VEDANTAM: I mean, at some level, that has to be a little bit disturbing, right? - the idea that you're drawing blood and throwing it down the sink.
GANGULY: Yes, absolutely. And that's kind of the point here though. So they are going to have the blood drawn. So you'd rather pay money, waste that blood, than know what your test results were.
VEDANTAM: Did any of the students give you verbal feedback about what happened and their impressions of it? Did any of them explain why they declined to be tested? I mean, they obviously must have thought about what the implications were as they made the choice.
TASOFF: Oh, yeah, so as - yeah, we actually asked them, what was their motivation? 85.7 percent, the most common explanation, was because, quote, ""it will cause me unnecessary stress or anxiety if I test positive.""
VEDANTAM: It's worth pointing out that lots of students elected to receive the information about whether they had herpes. In fact, a majority of students elected to do the rational thing and get their blood tested. But that isn't surprising. The surprising thing is that that number wasn't 100 percent because you should always be willing to hear information about your finances or your health.
As many as 20 percent of the students were willing to pay cold, hard cash to avoid finding out that they had genital herpes. Another thing the researchers found - students who were in a good mood were more likely to avoid information than those in a bad mood. This may seem surprising, but it actually makes complete sense. When you're in a good mood, do you really want to ruin how you feel by discovering you have herpes?
TASOFF: It's like an ignorance-is-bliss result.
VEDANTAM: Think for a moment about the implications of information aversion. So many health and well-being messages are premised on the idea that people will act rationally when it comes to preserving their health. What if that isn't true for a sizable number of people?
GANGULY: I think that we should consider whether scare tactics in advertising and things like that. I mean, whether that is a good technique to encourage people to get tested or not is questionable.
VEDANTAM: When we come back, we're going to leave the lab and head out into the real world to see how information aversion plays out in everyday life. Stay with us.
VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. There's no question that fear is an effective way to change how people behave. When a parent tells a kid to fall in line or risk losing iPad privileges for a week, or when a boss tells an employee to come into work on time or risk getting fired, these often produce the desired effect. We use scare tactics in public service announcements all the time, like in this road safety commercial from Thailand...
VEDANTAM: ...Where a speeding car runs into a group of pedestrians. Or this anti-smoking advertisement from Poland...
VEDANTAM: ...Where a lit cigarette is transformed into a candle at the base of a tombstone.
VEDANTAM: In Josh and Ananda's study, the majority of volunteers chose to get tested after being exposed to graphic images of herpes. This makes sense, says University of Illinois psychology professor Dolores Albarracin.
DOLORES ALBARRACIN: If you induce a significant level of fear, you're going to get a comparable reaction on the behavioral side.
VEDANTAM: Dolores and a team of researchers analyzed 250 studies done about the effectiveness of fear in transforming behavior. While the research shows fear, indeed, is effective, Dolores says it has limitations.
ALBARRACIN: It does work better for one-time behaviors. So getting vaccinated - if I have a threat and there is an effective vaccine right after, and I just go in and get it one time, that's easy to do. The behavior is done right after you experience the emotion. Emotions are not that long-lasting, so it's going to have an effect. But if it comes down to following the right diet, we all know how difficult that is. And whatever fear you might experience at one point is gone the next day.
VEDANTAM: This is the crux of the issue. If you want someone to do something one time, frightening them into doing it could be very effective. But if you want them to do something regularly and over a long period of time, fear might not be effective. In fact, some research suggests it could be counterproductive.
Let me just have you start, if you don't mind, by just introducing yourself. And tell me your name.
RITESH BANERJEE: Sure. My name is Ritesh Banerjee. I'm an economist.
VEDANTAM: A few years ago, Ritesh and his colleague Giulio Zanella began looking at data about 3,000 American women who all worked at a large company. All the women were between the ages of 50 and 64, and they were all covered by an insurance plan that provided a free mammogram every year.
BANERJEE: Which is perceived to be an important tool in the fight against breast cancer.
VEDANTAM: This company made a real push to help women get screened for breast cancer. It would automatically schedule mammograms for staffers and then remind women about upcoming appointments. Screenings were conducted right at the company, so they were easy to get to. And the wait times were minimal. In other words, many of the barriers that keep women from getting tested were absent at this company.
Ritesh wanted to find out how the decisions of women to get screened for breast cancer were shaped by information aversion. He obtained detailed information from the company about employees, including their health status and where they physically sat in relation to one another. He discovered that when one staffer was diagnosed with breast cancer, this dramatically changed the behavior of other women who worked in her vicinity.
BANERJEE: We find that on average, when a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, her coworkers - her immediate coworkers - female coworkers reduce their propensity to have a breast screening in the year in which the diagnosis takes place. And this impact is persistent for at least two more years after the diagnosis for that woman. Women in the closest proximity to the woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer learn of this information, their willingness to screen falls the most.
VEDANTAM: Ritesh found that the severity of the disease was key. Women who had a coworker diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer were less likely to skip their annual screenings. But if a woman had a more aggressive case of breast cancer, her colleagues were the ones who were more likely to skip the screenings.
BANERJEE: So it appears, in our data, that in groups where the stage of the cancer is late-stage, so not an earlier stage of cancer, that the avoidance behavior that we're observing is stronger.
VEDANTAM: Women who knew a coworker who was dying from breast cancer were the most likely to skip their mammograms. Seeing a colleague suffer may have frightened these women from obtaining information about their own health.
VEDANTAM: Not long ago, I was playing sports with a friend on a weekend. I was trying to change directions quickly when my ankle gave out from under me. I felt a sharp pain and collapsed. In a matter of moments, my ankle started to swell up. It was like watching a balloon inflate. I got some ice on the ankle right away. But when the pain and swelling didn't subside and I found I could put no weight on the ankle, I decided I had to go to the emergency room. The pain in my ankle as my friend drove me to the ER was nowhere as bad as the pain in my head. Already, I had visions of needing surgery and being incapacitated for a long period of time. I desperately wanted to believe my injury wasn't serious.
When I got to the ER, the triage nurse took one look at my ballooned ankle and told me it was broken. I argued with her and told her the pain wasn't that bad. When someone took my blood pressure and found that it was high, I insisted they measure it again until they got a lower reading. I didn't think of it at the time, but what I was experiencing was information aversion. I knew I had hurt myself, but I didn't want to know how badly. As it turned out, the ankle wasn't broken. It was just a very bad sprain.
In the grand scheme of things, an ankle sprain is a trivial problem. It isn't cancer or heart disease or a serious infection. It isn't bankruptcy or like losing a job. But it made me realize that if I could experience information aversion for something so small, it's hardly surprising that people experience much more information aversion when the stakes are higher.
People who avoid information rationally know that they would be better off if they fully understood the bad news. You should always be willing to hear information about your finances or your health. But deep in the brain, there are rules that tell us to avoid things that are unpleasant, painful or scary. Like listeners Jason, Annie and Nancy, we shut out the news we'd rather not hear. If we want people to pay attention to negative information, we can't assume that they will behave like rational robots. We have to communicate information accurately but also give people the capacity to process and deal with psychological pain. Fighting the ostrich effect means fighting a myth. Avoiding information doesn't mean you're a fool. It means you're human.

VEDANTAM: Before we go, one absolutely vital piece of information. The term the ostrich effect isn't fair to ostriches. It turns out they don't shove their heads in the sand out of fear. Ostriches have underground nests. When they burrow their faces in the ground, they're actually checking on their eggs. It seems like even the ostrich knows while ignorance might be bliss, knowledge is power.

"Katie Lee knows a thing or two about hosting parties for a discerning crowd.
The famous foodie and cookbook author has been working in the food and beverage industry for over 15 years. With four cookbooks under her belt, the seasoned chef has an arsenal of tips and tricks for hosting holiday gatherings-- from intimate family gatherings to larger than life fiestas.
Now that the weather is warming, the ""Beach Bites"" host shares some of her favorite springtime cooking tips with Fox News. She even has two, newsignature recipes starring everyone’s favorite Easter treat—Peeps Marshmallows.
Fox News:What are some of your favorite Easter and spring holiday traditions?
Katie Lee:There is a great feeling of renewal in the spring. Living in New York, I am so happy feel the temperatures begin to rise and the leaves turn green. I usually cook a big Easter brunch with my family and friends. There is always a ham, deviled eggs, and my grandma’s pea salad recipe.
I like a light and refreshing cocktail for spring. As soon as the weather gets the least bit warm, I start making Aperol spritz. I have cocktail hour on my terrace with a spritz, prosciutto and green olives.
Did you grow up eating Peeps?
Growing up, I remember receiving the iconic yellow Chicks every year in my Easter basket, and now that I’m an adult, I still get excited every season to eat them.
I think certain foods create nostalgia and bring us back to different times in our lives. The new Peeps Delights are a “grown-up” version of the classic and I’m a bit of a choc-a-holic.I had a great time helping the brand launch their new line at this year’s South Beach Wine & Food Festival. People get very excited about Peeps!

What are three warm-weather party tips no host should party plan without?
When you’re planning an outdoor party, create a menu that’s easy to execute and fine to be served room temperature. I usually make a few salads in advance and keep them in the fridge until serving time.
Remember lighting is important, string up some café lights or even clear Christmas tree lights and light some citronella candles. I always keep bug spray on hand as well. A small fan can help keep bugs away as well.
Any tips for those feeling too intimidated to host?
Keep it simple. Summer is a great time to start entertaining because it is supposed to be relaxed and informal. Remember, people are happy to be going out and having an invitation into your home. As long as you keep the wine flowing, all will be ok!",0
"The Switch     Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events       How Russian trolls got into your Facebook feed            Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.    You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.
On Nov. 1, the House Intelligence Committee released social media advertisements that were pushed by Russian groups to influence the 2016 U. S. presidential election. (Joyce Koh/The Washington Post)    Americans are getting our first glimpse of how we got played. On Wednesday, Congress released some of the 3,000 Facebook ads and Twitter accounts created by Russian operatives to sway American voters. You can explore them in an analysis the Post published here. These disturbing messages, seen by up to 126 million Americans, raise thorny questions about Silicon Valley’s responsibility for vetting the information it publishes. Beyond Washington, it leaves all of us who use social media to keep up with friends, share photos and follow news wondering: How’d the Russians get to me? The short answer is Silicon Valley made it very easy. Facebook’s top lawyer told Congress on Wednesday the Russian effort was “fairly rudimentary.” Here’s what he meant: Ever notice a Facebook ad that’s eerily relevant to something you’ve been talking about? Had an ad for a pair of sneakers follow you around the Internet for a week? Or seen an ad that says your friend “liked” it? That’s the occasionally creepy handiwork of advertising tech, which covertly tracks much of what you do online—and then sells access to you to the highest bidder. We’re just now waking up to the fact that not only traditional marketers and legitimate political campaigns are buying in. It’s also Russian trolls hoping to manipulate you. You were in Russia’s crosshairs if you liked the Facebook page of Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. Same goes for people who said they were fans of Martin Luther King, Jr. Russians even targeted people who shared enough stuff about the South that Facebook tagged them being interested in “Dixie.”    On Nov. 1, the House Intelligence Committee released social media advertisements that were pushed by Russian groups to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. (Joyce Koh/The Washington Post)    There’s no way to tell if you personally saw a Russian post or tweet. I’d certainly like to know, but Facebook so far hasn’t disclosed to individuals if they were exposed to posts from a troll farm called the Internet Research Agency. (Ads paid for by that group made up the bulk of a trove published on Wednesday.) Facebook lawyer Colin Stretch on Wednesday told Congress the social network had notified Facebook members broadly about the issue, but it would be “much more challenging” to identify and notify specific people. Facebook’s advertising systems are largely automated, so no human had to check before these ads went online. Often they originated from groups with legitimate-sounding names, such as “Donald Trump America.” Facebook and Twitter have now taken down posts they suspect to have “inauthentic” Russian roots and instituted new review systems. Legislators are threatening new laws that could further rein them in. Of course, you didn’t have to click on these posts, or believe what they were pitching. But social media tech is particularly good at making messages irresistible. The Russian trolls didn’t have to spend much money on these marketing techniques to have an impact thanks to precision targeting—and free promotion for buzzy content. The most basic tool they used is called targeted advertising. By watching what you and your friends share and do on—and off—the social network, Facebook slots you into categories. Some are demographic (age, state, gender) and others are based on things you’ve “liked” and the assumptions Facebook draws about your interests. Facebook will actually show you what it thinks of you,if you click here. (It also lets you edit the categories; doing so could make its ad targeting even more effective.) The Internet Research Agency bought ads targeted to people with diverse criteria, ranging from gay and lesbian groups to the Muslim Brotherhood. The Russian agents also used an ad technique based on tracking and following certain people around the Web. For example, if you at some point clicked on a troll website masquerading as legitimate, the site’s tech could identify your web browser and allow the trolls to “re-target” ads to you elsewhere around the web. On Facebook, Russian operatives used a tool called Custom Audiences to target people in such ways. Most effective of all: Russian trolls used celebrities—and our own friends—to get to us. For free. For example, in April of 2016, rapper Nicki Minaj retweeted a message about an upsetting shooting from the twitter handle @Ten_GOP. That account looked like it was the Tennessee Republican Party, but it was actually a Russian troll interested in inflammatory content. Minaj’s post was retweeted and “liked” more than 24,600 times. (For the record, the actual Tennessee Republican Party told The Washington Post that they had contacted Twitter three times about their impersonator problem). You or your friends might have shared one of these posts on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest or beyond, which the industry calls “organic” promotion. These posts reached way more than the 10 million people who saw paid ads. On Facebook alone, they found their way in front of the eyes of 126 million Americans.

A new video series from The Washington Post",0
"n 2011 I organised a protest at U2’s headline gig at Glastonbury. As Bono sang The Fly, a 9ft wide, 24ft high balloon was inflated at the front of the audience bearing the words U PAY TAX 2?. The protest was prompted by U2’s decision in 2006 to move their tax affairs from Ireland to the Netherlands, after the Irish government decided to cap the tax-free exemption on royalties at 225,000 (before this, artists in Ireland were not obliged to pay any tax on royalties). The aim of the action was to highlight the impact of transnational tax dodging on the developing world. In a chilling report, Christian Aid estimated that $160bn is lost to the developing world each year as profits made in poorer countries are shifted to wealthier tax havens.
A few days before the protest, the co-founder of Bono’s charity One, Jamie Drummond, telephoned me to try to persuade me to call off the action, citing worries that we might undermine Bono’s campaigning efforts. We had a long conversation in which I eventually suggested that, regardless of what we do, Bono’s tax affairs will inevitably cast a shadow over his campaigning. At this point Drummond became slightly aggressive, and insisted that it was our actions alone that were doing damage.
With the recent Paradise Papers revelations concerning Bono’s finances, it looks like my prediction has come to pass. Bono chose to invest in a company based in ultra-low tax Malta, which incorporated a Lithuanian company – in order to buy a shopping centre – which has paid no tax in Lithuania despite having made profits. The company was later transferred to zero-tax (on company profits) Guernsey. To be fair to Bono, he is not creating artificial structures in order to avoid paying tax on his income (the kind of practice adopted by some of the stars of Mrs Brown’s Boys). However, by making this investment, he supported ultra-low tax jurisdictions and elaborate structures for cheating tax. And it is these things which are so harmful, not only to ordinary people in developed countries but also to the developing world.
I am now a philosophy professor, using teaching and writing to campaign instead of massive balloons. And if anything, my research has shown how the harm caused to the developing world is now even more undeniable. Perhaps six years ago Bono could be forgiven for not accepting the message of our campaign. But in a dramatic turn around, even the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is now warning of the damage to the developing world caused by profit shifting. Bono has responded by expressing horror that a company he has invested in has broken rules. However, it is at best naive not to assume that elaborate company structures involving low-tax jurisdictions are set up for the purpose of shifting profits.
Of course this is partly about regulation. The international tax rules were designed for an era before globalisation and technological advances made global profit-shifting possible, and they are no longer fit for purpose. But while lax regulation makes tax cheating possible, when wealthy individuals like Bono “shop around” different countries for the best tax deal they fan the flames of tax competition, putting ever more pressure on countries around the world to cut their tax rates.
This leads to a race to the bottom in which around the world there is ever less money for schools, hospitals and the public good. Tax competition also undermines democratic self-determination. It ought to be the prerogative of legitimate governments to decide on the appropriate level of tax. By creating the downward pressure of tax competition, wealthy individuals limit the choices of sovereign states.
The rallying cry for Brexit was to “take back control”. In fact, it is not the EU that is sapping our self-determination, but the wealthy individuals and transnational corporations that hold countries to ransom through the mechanism of tax competition. Bono and Drummond have good intentions. But what they can’t see is that our current economic system is not working either for the developing world or for ordinary people in the developed world. If we want to help the developing world, we need to oppose that system – not encourage it.

"North Korea taunted the world on Saturday with claims they had developed a new nuclear weapon. Dictator Kim Jong-un claimed his military could make the bomb in high volumes. The Korean Central News Agency even released a picture showing Jong-un inspecting the bomb with military advisers.
Just hours later, Jong-un’s regime announced they had completed the country’s sixth successful nuclear weapons test. The weapon was reported to be a hydrogen bomb.
CNN reported: “The test was a ‘perfect success’ and the final step in attaining a ‘state nuclear force,’ long-time news anchor Ri Chun Hee said in a televised announcement Sunday.”
North Korea’s news agency also reported that the bomb was designed to be fitted onto an intercontinental ballistic missile. The communist regime has been testing ICBMs for months.
The last reported nuclear test in North Korea happened last September. The country has tested nuclear weapons successfully five previous times since 2006.
It’s likely impossible to knew for certain if North Korea actually detonated a hydrogen bomb, but meteorological agencies in the region, including the U. S. Geological Survey, detected strong artificial earthquakes, giving credence to the possibility of a nuclear detonation.
The USGS initially detected a 5.2 magnitude tremor but later upgraded the event to a 6.3 magnitude earthquake, the Washington Examiner reported.
“Possible explosion, located near the site where North Korea has detonated nuclear explosions in the past. If this event was an explosion, the USGS National Earthquake Information Center cannot determine its type, whether nuclear or any other possible type,” the USGS said in a statement, according to the Examiner.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Meteorological Agency measured the quake at a 6.1 magnitude while South Korea said the quake was a 5.6.
The bomb’s blast was the most powerful in North Korea’s history.
NORSAR, an independent seismic monitor, estimated the blast created a yield of about 120 kilotons. The tremors caused by North Korea’s Sunday test were at least 10 times more powerful than the fifth test, Japanese officials said. An official at the Korea Meteorological Administration estimated the blast was about 50 kilotons.
The move comes after weeks of aggression from North Korea toward the U. S. and its allies. The regime has been repeatedly warned to halt its development of ICBMs and nuclear bombs, but Jong-un has not relented.
North Korea even made the mistake of firing a missile over Japan last week, which resulted in a strong response from the U. S. military, including flying fighter jets over the Korean Peninsula in a show of force.",0

Jimmy Carter backs Trump, New York Times calls it 'lust'
Posted by     Christopher Stokes        October 24, 2017
Former President Jimmy Carter did an interview with the New York Times in which he said many things to support current President, Donald Trump. Carter said he's not buying the whole Russia-meddling story, he supports Trump's stance on the NFL protests, and he thinks the media is completely unfair to the President. For showing such support, The New York Times then writes the headline, ""Jimmy Carter Lusts for a Trump Posting,"" thus proving Carter and Trump's point about just how biased the media is.

"Donald Trump and republicans are not the only ones who believe that the mainstream media is extremely biased, leaning mostly towards the liberal left. It only takes someone with eyes to see that. YouGov found in its polls that most Americans agree that the mainstream media is biased.
According to recent YouGov polling, 70% of Americans “agree that news organizations report stories in a light that’s partial to who owns them.” In addition, while 52% of Democrats agree with this sentiment, a whopping 85% of Republicans do. When YouGov then asked “whether or not one would trust a news source if its track record proved objectivity,” 83% of Democrats said they would compared to 58% Republicans.
“The percentage point difference in the two surveys reveals that the general public sides more with Republicans than it does with Democrats on the topic of media bias,” YouGov noted.
Angered by the legacy media’s “Witch Hunt,” Trump has repeatedly blasted the “very fake” news media for making up stories about him and hisadministration.
He recently tweeted that the “Fake News Media” has “never been so wrong” or “dirty.” He accused the establishment media of using “phony sources to meet their agenda of hate. Sad!”
Donald Trump woke the people up, that’s for sure. It’s like we’ve been in a trance like stupor for the past 15 years! FINALLY along comes a non-politician who douses the country with the cold water truth! YAY!!! There IS hope for America!
When every single story about this administration is negative or out of context, it’s fake news. The news media in general is making itself irrelevant by constantly attacking the Trump administration with “unnamed sources” and later retracting stories. It’s an embarrassment to journalism.
ICYMI: @BreitbartNews's @mboyle1 did the reporting that forced CNN to retract their hit piece & issue an apology. https://t.co/YWoTxEdNG3",1
"BREAKING: America’s Worst Nightmare About Texas Church Shooter Just Confirmed – Here’s Who He Is
The second attack this week to take the lives of innocent Americans just struck again during the most innocent of activities, just five days after the first. On Tuesday, eight were ruthlessly killed in New York and now 27 more have lost their lives this week in a senseless attack on churchgoers in Texas. As the media scrambles to blame this on the gun in a push for more control, the country’s worst nightmare was just confirmed about who the shooter is and what he set out to accomplish.
Americans, specifically Christians, are under attack in these trying days prophesized about in the Bible that we are seeing come to fruition under the most terrifying terms. In September, white Tennessee churchgoers were ambushed and killed by a gunman in an unprovoked attack that was swiftly swept under the rug by the mainstream media desperate to hide the important details and keep the attention on irrelevant issues like Russian collusion. Now, the blood of 27 faithful believers is on their hands after disregarding the clear and present threat in this country to keep the focus on their rhetoric. There’s no hiding what’s happening now and every American needs to be on high alert for what’s coming.
Just a few short hours after a gunman stormed the small Sutherland Springs, Texas, church, we’re seeing that the dead suspect is white, but his race had nothing to do with what he did. While his race and other irrelevant factors arewhat we’ll hear most about from the mainstream media, there is a much larger fact about this suspect which is absolutely everything Americans must know right now.
The mass shooter who opened fire inside a Texas church killing at least 27 – including a two-year-old child – has been identified as a 26-year-old former Bible study teacher who was dishonorably discharged from the US Air Force. Devin Patrick Kelley walked into the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, dressed in full combat gear, and began shooting, according to local law enforcement sources.
Kelley, 26, of New Braunfels, a suburb of San Antonio, was killed after a brief foot chase into Guadalupe County, according to Guadalupe County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Robert Murphy. But it is still unclear if the gunman shot himself or was taken down by authorities. San Antonio police raided Kelley’s home on Sunday evening, with K9 and bomb squad units.
While this seems like a random attack from a psychotic white guy who the left will use as a poster child for more gun control, his reasoning for arming up and taking outa building full of Christians was because is religion. “The shooter is dead. He has not been officially identified, but Mustachio Tweeted: ‘#texaschurchshooting shooter is 29-year-old US marine turned Muslim convert, Samir Al-Hajeed. His manifesto is making its rounds on the web,’” the Santa Monica Observer reported.
“Pres. Trump is in Japan. He tweeted ‘May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs. The FBI is on scene, and I am monitoring the situation,’” the Observer added. “At least 27 people were killed and around 27 injured in a Texas church shooting Sunday morning, law enforcement sources told ABC News.”
“The alleged shooter is dead, and it appears there is no longer an active threat at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 40 miles southeast of San Antonio, police told ABC News.” “A person who said she works at a gas station across the street from the church told ABC News she heard rapid gunfire at around 11:15 a.m., leading congregants from the church as well as customers at the station to run inside for cover. ‘We heard several shots and we all started running inside the store,’; she said.” ‘It lasted about 15 seconds. I yelled, ‘Get down! Get inside!’ and we all went into hiding,” said the woman, who said she is 49 but declined to give her name. She said the gas station locked its doors. ‘We have not reopened,’ she said.” “She then said that within minutes of the gunfire, emergency personnel had arrived at the scene. ‘There were officers whowere checking the wounded in here were asking them questions,’ she said.” The Daily Mail has more on this white man-turned-terrorist and the horrific crime he perpetrated on the faithful:
Kelley, who was reportedly married, had recently posted a photo of an AR-15 style gun on his Facebook page with the caption: ‘She’s a bad b***h.’
A LinkedIn account which appears to be Kelley’s states that he joined the US Air Force after graduating New Braunfels High School in 2009.
He worked in logistics and supply in the Air Force until he was dishonorably discharged in 2014 and was even court martialed in May 2012, CBS News reported. He then volunteered as a teacher for Bible studies at Kingsville First Baptist Church, according to his LinkedIn which shows him posing which a young child.",1
"Muslims and the SJW crowd visiously attack ANYONE that doesn’t agree with their claim that “all religions are equal.” They say that anyone who doesn’t beleive this is a bigot, islamophobic, exenophobic racist. They’re a very tiny, but very loud minority. So when they start crying about how someone has “offended them,” they often get their way.
However, one peaceful pastor stood his ground, even after all of the forces of hell were sent against him and his small Baptist Church.
After the Leftists went to social media and maor news outlets demanding that the Church remove a sign they claimed was “bigoted,” they got SLAPPED DOWN!
Belmont Drive Missionary Baptist Church in Oregon has caused a disturbing stir in self-important hypocrites who believe that Islam is a supreme religion that should never be criticized. The church in Hood River has caused the thought police to sound the alarm on bigotry, proving their own intolerance.
Hood River resident Eric Cohn was nearly in tears over the church stating what God has already stated in the Bible, saying that his feelings were hurt when he looked at the message board.
“I literally had to stop and back up and make sure I saw what I saw, and I was profoundly offended and upset by it,” Eric Cohn said.
Cohn wasn’t the only one wishing that the U. S. would outlaw free speech. Hood River Mayor Paul Blackburn allowed his feelings to get the best of his logic, and he most likely hopes to use his political platform to do away with said pesky freedom.
“I was really annoyed and sad,” Hood River mayor, Paul Blackburn, said. “I am annoyed that in this political season there’s a solid case of ugly going on. I think it norms up this kind of behavior like ‘oh, it’s okay to be a bigot now.’”
Fortunately, Pastor Michael Harrington is more concerned with what his God says than whining secular multiculturalists. He promised not to remove the sign until he has another message that needs to be heard, and invites anyone who opposes his stance to civilly discuss the issue over a cup of coffee.
“I’m not politically correct. I’ve never been politically correct, but I think I’m biblically correct, and that’s what matters to me,” Harrington said. “It isn’t against any particular denomination. It’s just the fact that I have taught and will continue to teach that I have one God, one way of salvation, and one Bible that’s holy.”
Apparently, Cohn and Blackburn think that declaring what your religion teaches is “bigoted,” but only if you’re a Christian. If Muslims erected a sign stating, “Men are in charge of women by right…as for those wives from whom you fear arrogance — forsake them in bed and beat them [Quran 4:34],”these ignorant men would applaud them for being so open-minded, right?Or perhaps they’d like one that says, “I will cast terror into the hearts of unbelievers and you will strike off their heads and every fingertip [Quran 8:12].”",1
"Washington, DC (October 24, 2017) – PBS NewsHour, the nightly news broadcast on PBS anchored by managing editor Judy Woodruff, recently unveiled the new pbs.org/newshour, an online presentation that better showcases NewsHour’s thoughtful, objective and balanced journalism and better reflects what makes the brand stand out amid a flurry of endless information at user fingertips. The result is a faster, sleeker and better-organized experience that delivers audiences not only what they’re seeking but helps them discover something unexpected.
Over the past five months, PBS NewsHour partnered with Boston-based design firm Upstatement to dig deep into the legacy brand’s identity as a news organization and evaluate its former digital presentation. After a top-to-bottom review, senior leadership from NewsHour’s digital unit including director of product Vanessa Dennis, director of digital Travis Daub, and senior developer Stephan Rohde and a team from Upstatement, identified goals for the new design as well as creative visions. The team also convened an audience panel of NewsHour website users, and in many instances, was able to incorporate its feedback into the final site design.
“The design challenge for the NewsHour was to upgrade the site’s overall aesthetic without scrapping the soul of the brand that viewers have come to know and love,” said Kim Miller, senior designer at Upstatement.
The new site features refreshed typography, a brightened color palette, and modern design values. New formats better distinguish news and commentary, and reporting from the nightly broadcast is better organized and more accessible, as is a new live video collection, site-wide notifications and an always-present live video status that features a steady stream of speeches, news briefings and Congressional hearings.
“We are delighted to offer a refreshed and modern experience online that dovetails with the improvements we have been making on the NewsHour broadcast,” said Sara Just executive producer of the PBS NewsHour and WETA SVP.
The NewsHour team also made considerable security upgrades including being among the first PBS properties to serve most web pages over HTTPS. This change will offer improved privacy and help ensure the authenticity of content. Users will see a lock icon in their browser when visiting PBS NewsHour web pages.
PBS NewsHour is seen by over four million weekly viewers and is also available online, via public radio in select markets, and via podcast. PBS NewsHour is a production of NewsHour Productions LLC, a wholly-owned non-profit subsidiary of WETA Washington, D. C., in association with WNET in New York. Major funding for PBS NewsHour is provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, PBS and public television viewers. Major corporate funding is provided by BNSF, Babbel, and Collette, with additional support from Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Carnegie Corporation of New York, the J. Paul Getty Trust, the S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Lemelson Foundation, National Science Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Ford Foundation, Skoll Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Friends of the NewsHour and others.

Kansas caverns are 100-ft to 150-ft below the surface
Supported by thick limestone pillars six times stronger than concrete
Will have blast doors built to withstand a one-megaton nuclear explosion
After most of the world’s population is wiped off the map by a wayward meteorite or hail of nuclear missiles, the survival of the human race might just depend on a few thousand people huddled in recreational vehicles deep in the bowels of an eastern Kansas mine.
That’s the vision of a California man who is creating what he calls the world’s largest private underground survivor shelter, using a complex of limestone caves dug more than 100 years ago beneath gently rolling hills overlooking the Missouri River.
‘I do believe I am on a mission and doing a spiritual thing,’ said Robert Vicino, who has purchased a large portion of the former U. S. Army storage facility on the southeast edge of Atchison, about 50 miles northwest of Kansas City. ‘We will certainly be part of the genesis.’
Before it comes time to ride out Armageddon or a deadly global pandemic, though, Vicino says the Vivos Survival Shelter and Resort will be a fun place for members to take vacations and learn assorted survival skills to prepare them for whatever world-changing catastrophe awaits.
Jacque Pregont, president of the Atchison Chamber of Commerce, said some people think the shelter plan sounds creepy or that Vicino has ‘lost his mind,’ while others are excited because they will finally get a chance to tour the property.
Atchison is known as the birthplace of Amelia Earhart and one of the most haunted towns in Kansas, Pregont said, so the survival shelter is likely to add to the town’s tourism draw.
‘It’s quirky, and quirky gets attention,’ she said.
Recent Hollywood movies have done big business exploring themes about the human race, either through climate shifts, meteor impacts or zombie invasions.
And the National Geographic Channel show, ‘Doomsday Preppers,’ documents the efforts of Americans who are preparing for the end of the world with elaborate shelters and plenty of freeze-dried rations.

"The founding CEO of Fox News, Roger Ailes, has passed away, but the media empire he created and eventually pushed him out lives on, though still much in the image he cast for it.
When News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch started the conservative cable Fox News network in 1996 and hired Ailes to run it, Fox had to pay operators up to $11 per subscriber at the time, a departure from normal practices. Within five years, it had eclipsed rival CNN in the ratings and went on to become the number one ranked cable news network for over a decade.
It became part of the overall cable bundle, giving 21st Century Fox great reach, and delivering a massive, highly engaged audience to advertisers.
In turn, the channel delivered massive returns for shareholders.
Up until Ailes's departure, the company was responsible for 20 percent of parent company 21st Century Fox's operating income, a jewel in the crown. The profits gave him power. Allegations of how he abused that powerfrom very the star female anchors he lifted up became the source of his own undoing.
""He's a complicated figure,"" said Washington Post media and politics reporter Callum Borchers. ""He deserves all the credit he received over the years for changing the media landscape for not only creating an incredibly influential network, but in politics.""
""He had some charming personal qualities we've heard in the wake of his death from people who worked with him, but he was a flawed man as well,"" said Borchers.
""It's unfair to paint him as all bad...but it's also unrealistic to romanticize him as pure genius.""
Ailes cloned the best parts other cable news networks. Then he catered the content to the viewpoint of a conservative audience who felt its concerns weren't being reflected in the national news coverage, and added a bit of razzle-dazzle. The result was a ratings juggernaut and force that shaped national politics.
""Ailes understood how to program to people's underlying psychology,"" said Michael J. Wolf, CEO of consulting firm Activate. ""It was the first-ever designed news program that appealed to the things people are worried about. Were they going to be safe? Was the economy going to be safe?""
The resulting engagement has allowed it to command sizable license fees. Cable subscribers pay roughly 89 cents month for the Fox News Channel, according to a 2012 estimate by research firm SNL Kagan. CNN was estimated to average 57 cents per subscriber and MSNBC just 18 cents.
""He was a fantastic showman,"" said Elizabeth West, a professor at Columbia University's School of Journalism. (Aisles once said his lack of degree from the school is what qualified him to run a news network.)
""He had experience in talk shows,"" continued West, ""He knew how to use glitzy graphics and music. He knew how to pick talent,"" combining ""attractive people"" with conservative commentators in a way that proved ""very powerful.""
But allegations of sexual misconduct with some of those ""attractive people"" swirled and he resigned in July of 2016. His departure followed the filing of former Fox News Channel host Gretchen Carlson's sexual harassment lawsuit against him. Former Fox and now NBC News anchor also Megyn Kelly detailed alleged harassment by her former boss in her memoir. Roger Ailes denied the allegations.
Since Ailes resigned and received a reported $40 million golden parachute, the Fox News Network has continued to broadcast in much the same fashion as before. Though there have been a few more staff departures.
""You can build a very successful network and then at some point it doesn't need you,"" said Borchers.
In his aftermath, the media discourse feels more polarized than 20 years ago when Aisles entered the news business. You can choose more channels and viewpoints, both on TV, cable, and online.
You can even choose which set of facts you prefer.
And in his disgrace and now demise there is a turning point for women in the media business that he left such an indelible stamp upon, said professor West.
""I noticed last year many women coming forward with stories of what they endured from their bosses and they felt this was they endured as having price of having a job,"" in media, she said. ""Whether it was casual harassment or quid pro quo... for a long time we didn't talk about it.""
That change, too, has become part of the Ailes legacy.
""I hope a number of women, and younger women, are now saying, ""No. That's not right,"" said West.",0
"Did President Trump manage to do the unbelievable?
It seems that terrorism is one step closer to being defeated.
However, there are still no official confirmations.
According to our source Liberty Writers, Syrian television and news networks have reported thatAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, one of the most wanted terrorists of today’s world, has been killed during an airstrike. However as I mentioned before, the news has still not been officially confirmed.
Amaq, the official ISIS media wing, has still not given an official information regarding their leader’s death as well. As the Daily Mail informed us, this is not the first time it is reported that al-Baghdadi has been eliminated. The latest reports of his death have even faced multiple responds by experts who are doubting that this information is in fact, true.
The latest report posted regarding al-Baghdadi’s killing claimed that the airstrikehappened in Raqqa, a city in Syria.Another interesting fact is that Syrian activists actually reported an airstrike on Saturday, in which 7 people have been killed. However, al-Baghdadi’s name has not been mentioned in their report.
Al-Baghdadi was one of the most wanted men alive. His death had a 25 million dollar reward tag on it, making him an even bigger target. U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson even pointed out himself, that it was only a “matter of time” before he was assassinated.
“Nearly all of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s deputies are now dead, including the mastermind behind the attacks in Brussels, Paris, and elsewhere. It is only a matter of time before Baghdadi himself meets the same fate,” stated Tillerson.
So patriots, I want to hear your opinions on this. Do you believe that the Syrian reports are in fact true? Or do you think that this is another one of ISIS’s tactics to throw off the world’s focus? Scroll down and comment your thoughts below!

It seems that terrorism is one step closer to being defeated.
However, there are still no official confirmations.

"The mainstream media is falling apart after unprecedentedly low trust ratings and the initial signs of the fallout are here.
MSNBC just shut down one of its shows and the New York Times closed 8 floors in its offices!
These people have been attacking Donald Trump and that has only meant bad news for them. They have spread lies and rumors rather than factual news and the consequences are showing now.
According to Page Six:
MSNBC on Friday quietly pulled the plug on its afternoon show, “Live With Thomas Roberts,” after less than two years, Page Six has exclusively learned. Roberts was brought on to do the two-hour show last year to replace the much-hyped but low-rated “Ronan Farrow Daily.”
“Thomas was taken off of his [show] quietly,” said a news insider. “They’re not going to announce it, but he’s gone. His last day was Friday.”
Another source close to the anchor explained, “Thomas is in discussions to take on a new role with MSNBC in 2017.”
The ill-fated time slot will now transition to a “rotation of anchors” at the network.
The mainstream media doesn’t want you to know that they are having to cancel their shows so they are doing it quietly. They don’t want you to know that they are falling apart, but the signs of rust are showing and they pieces are falling off.
These people don’t know when to stop and are just going to try and relaunch Thomas Roberts under a different show, but if his first one failed then the signs for his second attempt with probably an even lower trust rating of MSNBC are not promising.
These people are just trying to recycle their garbage programming to trick viewers into thinking that it is something new, but we all know that they are full of it.
Share this everywhere to show that the lying institutions of the mainstream media are beginning to fall apart!",1

"Donald Trump has had a lot of enemies since the beginning, but the worst and most nasty is definitely the liberal media.
They have spread lies and hate and all kinds of terrible falsehoods about our President since day one. Well, Newt Gingrich just figured out how to put a stop to if once-and-for-all.
Once upon a time, I would have said that is a terrible idea. A free press is very valuable. Sadly, the mainstream media is not a “free press.” They operate as a thought factory, engineering versions of history that fit their own interests.
“I am personally offended by the American news media. I think it is destructive and disgusting. It is a danger to the country right now.”
He is definitely right about that. I’d say an even better idea would be to kick all those old media channels out and invite different news sources entirely. Not just conservative, but certainly NOT the guys and gals in there now. That way, Sean Spicer gets to stay.
The real lesson here is that the mainstream press needs to take responsibility, which they currently do not. They disseminatetheir own narrative with vigor then shun anything that disproves it.
It is not too late. We still need to freshen up the mix, but a good news team still has a lot of value. It’s time that we the people hold them accountable and say “Get you Sh!t together now or get out.”
If you wanna see that happen, share this out and let everyone know exactly how YOU feel. We need to work together to make this a reality.",1
"From their desks in St. Petersburg, Russian internet trolls at a company with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to co-opt American civil rights activists and use them to stoke racial tensions and stir political unrest, authorities said.
Congressional investigators tell ABC News that two online groups — BlackMattersUS and BlackFist — were among those used by Russian operators to reach out directly to unwitting individual Americans engaged in political activism and, in this case, encourage them to help organize rallies, train in self-defense and create music videos. In some cases, those activists even received financial support.
This effort, according to authorities, was the brainchild of the Internet Research Agency, the same St. Petersburg-based company identified by members of Congress as a key arm of the larger Russian operation aimed at influencing U. S. elections. That effort, as first reported by the the Russian publication RBC, now appears to be much broader than previously known, moving beyond the virtual world.
The Facebook and Twitter accounts associated with both groups have since been suspended, and ABC News could not reach any of the people identified online as being members of either group. Executives from both social media giants are expected to appear before Congress early next month to discuss steps they are taking to confront Russian efforts to infiltrate their platform, the scope of which is still not fully understood.
“The strategy appears to be a mix of suppressing votes, stoking fear and doing all they can to help their preferred candidate in Donald Trump and tear down Hillary Clinton,” said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who has seen Russian social media posts turned over to Congress by Facebook and Twitter.
By piggybacking on the themes of the Black Lives Matter movement, Russian agitators succeeded in convincing people interested in those same social justice causes that this stealthy foreign-backed effort was legitimate.
Ronnie Houston, a hip-hop artist in St. Louis, Missouri, who goes by the name Rough the Ruler, told ABC News that someone claiming to be from BlackMattersUS contacted him on the Facebook-owned photo-sharing platform Instagram in March of 2016 and asked him to record a song for them “about the social issues that were going on.” He wrote and performed the music for a short music video featuring video clips from marches, graphics touting the BlackMattersUS website, and lyrics describing police as “assassins” and protesters as “avengers.”
If he had known the group was not rooted in the Black Lives Matter movement, he said, he would not have agreed to record the song.
“No man I wouldn't have done it,” he said. “Wouldn't have done it at all.”
Conrad James, an activist in Raleigh, North Carolina, says he was approached in September 2016 by a woman who claimed to represent BlackMattersUS and asked him to speak at a rally they were hosting in Charlotte. James said more than 600 people turned up.
“They definitely were trying to stir-up trouble,” James said of BlackMattersUS. “Their intent was obviously to have some type of emotionally filled rally where people are adding fuel to the fire that was already happening around Charlotte.”
Nolan Hack, an activist from Los Angeles, said BlackMattersUS asked for his help organizing civil rights rallies last year and he was reimbursed for some of his travel expenses.
He said the notion of a Russia connection “never entered my mind.”
The effort was not limited to BlackMattersUS and BlackFist. Federal officials and Facebook executives confirmed to ABC News, first reported by The Daily Beast, that the troll farm was also behind a purported pair of bloggers – William and Kalvin – who produced social media posts and YouTube videos that carried more pointed political messages
“We, the black people, we stand in one unity” said one post from duo, who claimed to be from Atlanta. “We stand in one to say that Hillary Clinton is not our candidate.”
And the effort doesn’t appear to have stopped after the election. At least five American trainers paid this year by a group called BlackFist to offer free self-defense classes around the country, urging people to “be ready to protect your rights” and to “let them know that Black Power Matters.”
Omowale Adewale, a fitness trainer in Brooklyn, New York, says he was paid $320 via PayPal to conduct four classes in a month.
Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist and early investor in Facebook, says this effort is evidence of the Russian strategy “to anger both sides of the equation.”
“Classic Russian intelligence techniques of taking the most extreme voices and amplifying them,” he said. “It was the perfect petri dish for this kind of campaign.”
Swalwell said he wants Congress to find a way to address this type of interference without infringing on peoples’ rights.
“Russia was able to use our greatest strength, freedom of speech, and turn it into a weakness,” Swalwell said. “I think we have to find what is that fine line between making sure my mom can post any political opinion that she wants but an organized intelligence service of a foreign country isn't able to weaponize social media.”

"Sometimes, members of the Alt-Right make big impacts in very simple ways. Merely printing out a piece of paper saying “It’s okay to be white” and then taping it to a wall has succeeded in inciting outrage and international headlines that place white leaders in very uncomfortable situations. From an Alt-Right perspective, it’s truly amusing to watch an outbreak of hysteria and ensuing consternation from the cucks. At this late hour, provocation requires minimal effort on our part. Best of all, most of the time these frenzies just cause themselves. We get to sit back and laugh. Let’s recap some of the most salacious, because this shit is just plain hilarious.
Recall the furor at the University of Missouri back in 2015. It’s obvious that some freak (chimp behavior, hmmm) smeared feces around a bathroom. Then, another student (or perhaps the very same) discerned a swastika in the fecal smear, in much the same manner that the mentally deranged claim to see the face of Jesus Christ on a grilled cheese sandwich. This was enough to prompt a mass chimpout that pissed off and alienated lots of white people, causing a steepdrop in enrollmentand donations. Now, let’s move on from feces to flames.
Sometimes hate gets taken pretty far. Right before the November 2016 elections, a black church in the town of Greenville, Mississippi was torched by ahenchman of Richard Spencerand, sadly, was a member of its own congregation. Prior to setting it alight, he spray painted the message “Vote Trump” on the side of the building. One must give this dindu his due credit for spelling the phrase correctly. Proper spelling makes this particular incident somewhat of an aberration in the category of black-perpetrated hoaxes.
Of course, we all know there’s another group that exceeds the blacks in their enthusiasm for setting stuff on fire: Muslims. Back in June, one of them walked into her mosque in Des Moines, doused a patch of carpet with lighter fluid, and set it aflame. Unfortunately, the entire process occurred on camera, allowing the authorities to swiftly arresther. Little of the hysteria that benefits us so much was able to be generated.
A more successful arson attempt occurred in Houston, on Christmas Day of 2015. Apparently, despondent over the distinct lack of fun that his people get to experience on Christmas, a local Muslim tried to burn down his storefront mosque. A frenzy of outrage over Islamophobia reigned briefly until law enforcement cracked the case. The mosque garnered over a million dollars in donations and international media coverage until the truth emerged.
Here’s one that I find an especially comical symptom of our times: In March, a Jewish man living in upstate New York awoke to find swastikas spray painted on this side of his home. In an interview, he said that seeing his home marked with this iconic symbol of hate sent a “vein of fear” surging through his body. He also expressed incredulity that anyone would consider this acceptable behavior in 2017. Who would do such a thing? Well,him. Then, it gets even funnier. He was only claiming to be Jewish. That’s right, a fake Jew committed a fake hate crime.
After racist messages were found scrawled on message boards in the Air Force Academy’s preparatory school, the nation was captivated by animpassioned speechby some pathetic cuck with 3 stars on his collar. He demanded that racists must “get out!” because they have absolutely no place in the USAF, as a dyke with 1 star stood solemnly behind him. According to him, the Air Force could not deploy the full “power of diversity” with such individuals in its midst. A quick scroll through the comments section on Youtube reveals that many dipshits were moved literally to tears after the speech went viral, making the general a celebrated hero of the MSM. Predictably, aNegro cadetlater confessed to writing all of the hateful messages. I actually agree with the general that racists should leave the military. Men with common sense don’t deserve to die as cannon fodder for Israel in a war with Iran and Russia.
The uproar that a hate hoax generates is vastly disproportionate to the amount of attention it receives as the truth comes to light and everything fizzles out. I used to find this pattern a tad frustrating, but now I’ve come to realize that anything which heightens the level of perpetual hysteria we’re now living under is a good thing. Thus, the value of a hate hoax is derived not from it being discredited, but from the madness it initially stirs up.
After all, there are a lot more SJWs than there are of us. Moreover, these lunatics are able to operate with generous subsidies, without fear of losing their jobs. So, they can and do mobilize in large numbers when baited. The mayhem produced by their righteous outrage is a potent source of alienation from Clownworld, precisely the phenomenon that pushes people towards the Alt-Right.

"A recent lawsuit is claiming that Fox News intentionally misquoted Rod Wheeler, the special investigator looking into the death of Democratic National Committee staffer, Seth Rich. Rich is said by many to have been the leaker who gave Hillary Clinton and John Podesta’s emails to the whistleblowing website, Wikileaks.
This situationis clustered, however, considering the lack of evidence in favor of the lawsuit. Other left leaning mainstream media outlets have also been branding the original story as “fake news,” when it looks like it’s a misquote at best.
*NOTE: It wouldn’t be a stretch to assume a mainstream media outlet pushed fake news. They have been caught red-handed lying to the public on numerous occasionsbefore, it just appears to be a blanket term and overused, especially in this particular situation.
According to NPR, it all began May 16, the day the Fox News Channel broke what it called a “bombshell story” about an unsolved murder case: the fatal July 2016 shooting of 27-year-old Democratic Party staffer Seth Rich. Mainstream media outlets other than Fox News then immediately dubbed anyone seeking information on Rich’s untimely death as “conspiracy theorists” in an effort to discredit and kill all media stories so they could peddle back to the baseless Russian hacking lie. Fox reported that the leaks came from inside the party and not from hackers linked to Russia, a claim backed up by a Wikileaks operative but shunned in the mainstream media for not having enough support for the left-leaning narrative pushed in virtually every news segment in America. Even NPR stated that the Fox News report merely suggested that Democrats might have been connected to Rich’s death and that a cover-up had thwarted the official investigation.
The Fox News report that angered Democrats everywhere, including those in the media, relied heavily on Rod Wheeler, a former police detective, hired months earlier on behalf of the Riches by Republican ally, Ed Butowsky. Butowsky is a well-known Trump supporter. Once the report aired, Wheeler claimed words were put in his mouth, yet he continued to appear on Fox News shows and news segments, and backed up what he is now saying is “false quotations,” not “fake news.”
Fox’s president of news, Jay Wallace, told NPR on Monday there was no concrete evidence that Rod Wheeler was misquoted by the reporter, Malia Zimmerman. Fox News declined to allow Zimmerman to comment for the NPR article. The original story featuring Wheeler, which first aired in May, was retracted by Fox News a week later.
Adding more fuel to the fire is the meeting betweenTrump’s press secretary Sean Spicer at the White House with Wheeler and Butowsky to review the Rich story a month before Fox News ran the piece. Spicer admits to meeting with the two but denies claims that the president was involved in advancing the story.
“Ed’s been a longtime supporter of the president and asked to meet to catch up,” Spicer told NPR on Monday night. “I didn’t know who Rod Wheeler was. Once we got into my office, [Butowsky] said, ‘I’m sure you recognize Rod Wheeler from Fox News.’ ”
Spicer said Butowsky laid out what they had found about the case. “It had nothing to do with advancing the president’s domestic agenda — and there was no agenda,” Spicer says now. “They were just informing me of the [Fox] story.”
Spicer says he is not aware of any contact, direct or not, between Butowsky and Trump. And Butowsky now tells NPR he has never shared drafts of the story with Trump or his aides — that he was joking with a friend.
Instead, Butowsky repeatedly claimed that the meeting was set up to address Wheeler’s pleas for help landing a job for the Trump administration. Wheeler’s attorney, Doug Wigdor, says there is no evidence to support that claim.
In the suit, Wheeler alleges that Butowsky was using the White House references to pressure him. Of course, Rod Wheeler played his own role in furthering the story, which he never once alleged as “fake” only that he was misquoted. But he contends that he regretted it the same day it aired. His lawsuit alleges Fox News defamed him by manufacturing two false quotations, attributing them to him and ruining his reputation by blaming him when other media outlets began making “conspiracy theorist” claims about anyone seeking information into Rich’s murder.
Wheeler, who is African-American, is also suing Fox News for racial discrimination alleging he didn’t advance as quickly as his white counter parts at the network.

"aYou can love or hate Trump, but what he says about media 100% correct!
They lie and have such propaganda machine running. Mainstream media can’t even see what harm they are doing to the Nation! Unless it’s on purpose of course.
We need more truth tellers, people who are not afraid to stand up to power. One of them is legendary hockey announcer Don Cherry. He thinks there is a double standard in the media when it comes to kneeling.
According to The Daily Caller:
Cherry used the media’s disdain of Tim Tebow as an example of a double standard.
He released a statement on Twitter Wednesday that read in part:
The left-wing media are true to form. When Tim Tebow the former quarterback of the Denver Broncos went to his knees to thank the Lord, the lefties in the media said he was wrong and it was the wrong thing to do. The late-night leftie talk shows made fun of Tim.
No other religion you can make fun of and ridicule…only Christianity. If you are Christian you are open.
Tebow used to kneel on the sidelines after big plays or to just pray during the course of the game. It’s not exactly the same as kneeling during the national anthem, but he certainly has a point to a degree about the media being very harsh on Tebow.
Of course, he’s right. Media hypocrites believe in free speech when it is the free speech they want to hear. Ahead of his time: He was calling Liberals mentally ill before a majority of people realized they were.
I suspect it’s not so much a double standard. As their hate-filled obsession to harm President Trump and the people that support him. The media no longer has any standards. Just their hate.

"We were all surprised to see how great Maleficent, Jungle Book, Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast turned out to be. However, we are sure the live-action treatment is not going to end just there, so the question is, Which Disney movie will get the live-action treatment next?
As, Back in May 2016, it was reported that Disney was provided with a new pitch for The Little Mermaid. Three months later we got more news on the project. As Marc Platt and Hamilton‘s Lin-Manuel Miranda were brought on as producers.
The Little Mermaid isbased on Hans Christian Andersen’s 1837 tale, which studio previously adapted into the classic 1989 animated film. Everyone loved the classic. Judging by the history of Disney, I am certain that they will be able to make a great live-action movie.
However, Disney still hasn’t officially confirmed the film. But, I am sure that day will come. And when it does, the biggest question will be. Who should star as Ariel?Well following are some of the Actresses that we think can really bring Ariel and her sweet voice to life.
Following is the synopsis of The Little Mermaid.
Ariel is a free-spirited mermaid, who is off on the adventure of a lifetime with her best friend, the adorable Flounder and the reggae-singing Caribbean crab Sebastian at her side. But it will take all of her courage and determination to make her dreams come true and save her father’s beloved kingdom from the sneaky sea witch Ursula. – Wikipedia",1

"First lady Melania Trump has reportedly begun piecing together a team of staffers to defend her and her family against attacks from sleazy celebrities like Katie Rich, Rosie O’Donnell, Stephen Spinola and Chelsea Handler.
“White House insiders say that the first lady is close to finalizing her team to manage these attacks,”
But that is not all today she re-filed a lawsuit against Daly Mail over a report she worked as an escort!
First lady Melania Trump has re-filed a libel lawsuit against the corporation that publishes the Daily Mail’s website, this time in New York, for reporting rumors that she worked as an escort.
In the new filing Monday, the first lady’s attorneys argue the report damaged her ability to profit off her high profile.
Mrs. Trump, the filing states, “had the unique, one-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former professional model, brand spokesperson and successful businesswoman, to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which Plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world.”
She is looking for $150 million in compensatory and punitive damages from the news group for inflicting “extremeharmto Plaintiff’s private reputation.
The assertion filed within the New York Supreme Courtroom focuses on a narrative revealed by Mail On-line on August 19, 2016.
An earlier lawsuit in opposition to the news company was dismissed from a Maryland when a judge ruled that the matter was outsidethe jurisdiction of the courtroom. The lawsuit was filed in August and cited a narrative that had been revealed the week earlier and insinuated that she had labored as an escort.
…the Daily Mail revealed a narrative outlining the former supermodel’s “very racy” past, together with Trump’s former romantic relationships, her profession in modeling and her immigration story. Pulling particulars from in Trump’s native Slovenia, the Daily Mail article claims the modeling company Trump used to work for was really an escort service.
The Daily Mail retracted the story after the filing, however, it seems thatMelania Trump will continuepursuing the lawsuit.
Mainstream media will finally see what happens when you pick a fight with our First Lady. This could be a good lesson to every fake news outlet out there!
Melania Trump just showed all of these fake news outlets what will happen when you pick a fight with her.",1

"Newly released audio from the Clark County Fire Department has provided even more proof that there were multiple shooters during The Las Vegas Massacre, further debunking the officialnarrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened during the worst mass shooting in American history.
The audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel.
Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found thatat around the1:27:54 mark of the audio fileyou can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction.
“We have a firefighter’s wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay. We are trying to get further on the name,” dispatch frantically notes. “Batallion 6, be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay, at the bar, we currently have, another active shooter up there.”
After being asked to confirm the information, dispatch goes on to make clear that she is specifically speaking about the bar at the top of the hotel rather than anywhere near the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock supposedly operated from.
“The only information I have is it’s the bar on top of the Mandalay Bay,” dispatch continues before being asked if the shooter was pinned down or “just sheltering right now?”
Interestingly, the story doesn’t end there, as Ambellas wrote in his piece,author and entrepreneur Grant Cardone was actually holding an investors meeting in the very same bar shortly before the attack took place. The popular social media influencer apparently left the Foundation Room literally seven minutes before authorities claim Paddock opened fire from his 32nd floor room.
Cardone wrote about his experience in a post on Medium in which he claimed that theMandalay Bay was telling visitors that therewas at least one active shooter, “moving” throughout the hotel shooting people.
It was reported by the Mandalay there was a shooter moving through the hotel. I told Elena and Johnny, “stay close to me, we are not running out, stay calm, there is one person in charge — where I go, you follow, no matter what.”
About this time, there was starting to be a lot more activity through the casino and now the reports suggested there was active multiple terrorists moving through the hotel shootingguest. Then twitter started showing up with feeds suggesting multiple hotels being attacked, bomb threats, and more.
This new report documenting yet another instance of a possible second shooter comes on the heels of dozens of similar reports, with the most recentarriving in the form of air traffic control audio that directlystatedthat there were active shooters on the runway.
“During the air traffic control recordings, which were released by political strategist and co-founder of “The New Right” Mike Tokes, one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself,” SHTFplan reported.
“Shutting down might not be a good idea, there’s active shooters on the runway,” he declared. “The 19s are closed, we are in the process of trying to round them up, they are on the airport property.”
Air traffic control tapes on the night of the Las Vegas shooting:

Slowly but surely we are beginning to see the truth about the horrific attack come to light despite authorities desperately trying to prevent it from reaching the American people.
Sadly, the picture emerging is one that includes a shocking amount of evidence pointing towards a classic deep state false flag operation.

Facebook has said ads bought by Russian operatives reached 10 million of its users. But does that include everyone reached by the information operation? Couldn’t the Russians also have created simple — and free — Facebook posts and hoped they went viral? And if so, how many times were these messages seen by Facebook’s massive user base? The answers to those questions, which social media analyst Jonathan Albright studied for a research document he posted online Thursday, are: No. Yes. And hundreds of millions — perhaps many billions — of times. “The primary push to influence wasn’t necessarily through paid advertising,” said Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “The best way to to understand this from a strategic perspective is organic reach.” In other words, to understand Russia’s meddling in the U. S. election, the frame should not be the reach of the3,000 adsthat Facebook handed over to Congress and that were bought by a single Russian troll farm called the Internet Research Agency. Instead, the frame should be the reach of all the activity of the Russian-controlled accounts — each post, each “like,” each comment and also all of the ads. Looked at this way, the picture shifts dramatically. It is bigger — much bigger — but also somewhat different and more subtle than generally portrayed.    Both Facebook and Twitter say Kremlin-linked organizations used their platforms to try and influence voters during the 2016 election. Here's how. (The Washington Post)   Albright, who also is a faculty associate at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, has been studying fake news and Russian propaganda for months. And over the past week, as the names of some of the 470 Russian-bought pages and accounts have trickled out in news reports, he has been using a Facebook-owned analytics tool, called CrowdTangle, to measure the Russian campaign and also has downloaded the most recent 500 posts for each of them. For six of the sites that have been made public — Blacktivists, United Muslims of America, Being Patriotic, Heart of Texas, Secured Borders and LGBT United — Albright found that the content had been “shared” 340 million times. That’s from a tiny sliverof the 470 accounts that have been made public. Even if those sites were unusually effective compared to the 464 others, Albright’s findings still suggest a total reach well into the billions of “shares” on Facebook. The terminology is important here. For the purposes of these metrics, a “share” is essentially how often a post may have made its way into somebody’s Facebook “news feed” — without determining whether any of these users actually read the post. Another metric, called “interactions,” counts something narrower but more important -- the number of times individual users acted on what they had read by sharing a post with their Facebook “friends,” hitting the ""like"" button, making a comment or posting an emoji symbol. That measurement for those six accounts, Albright's research showed, was 19.1 million. That means that more people had direct “interactions” with regular posts from just six accounts than saw the ads from all 470 pages and accounts that Facebook has identified as controlled by the Russian troll farm in St. Petersburg, called the Internet Research Agency. Facebook had no immediate comment on Albright’s research. The company has shut down all 470 pages and accounts it has identified as controlled by the Internet Research Agency. In a blog post on Monday, Elliot Schrage, vice president of policy and communications, wrote, ""We’re still looking for abuse and bad actors on our platform — our internal investigation continues. We hope that by cooperating with Congress, the Special Counsel and our industry partners, we will help keep bad actors off our platform."" The other revelation in Albright’s download, including thousands of posts he has put online in an interactive graphic, is that most of them have nothing to do with the Nov. 8 election. Instead they are tailored to fit seamlessly into the ordinary online conversation of their particular audiences — politically activated African Americans, gay women, Muslims and people concerned about illegal immigration, Texan heritage or the treatment of veterans. There is talk of political issues, but relatively little about voting for Republican Donald Trump or against Democrat Hillary Clinton. That suggests that the Facebook part of the Russian disinformation campaign consisted of at least two steps: The first was to identify voters and sort them into buckets based on the issues they responded to. This was done through the organic posts. The second step was to target voters in these buckets with Russian- bought political ads shaped to their interests, with the intention -- in at least some cases -- of affecting voting behavior. “They were working to lead people along and develop a sense of trust,” Albright said. The tone of the posts varies strikingly by the page. The one seemingly managed by a lesbian is intimate, confidential and chatty, with complaints about parents and teachers not understanding the challenges of being young and gay. The English is nearly flawless. One popular post said simply, ""Bi and proud!"" with a thumbs-up emoji attached to the end. The United Muslim posts take pride in their religion, demandrespect and seek to distance their faith from terrorism and ISIS. ""Share if you believe Muslims have nothing to do with 9/11. Let's see how many people know the truth!,"" said one that reached 35,275 news feeds. The Blacktivist posts are assertive and often angry, with many references to police violence against African Americans. Several urge the sharing of a video. One that reached 68,000 news feeds said, ""There is a war going against black kids."" The other pages are conservative and anti-immigrant, with particular complaints about the treatment of U.S. veterans. One on ""Being Patriotic,"" said, ""At least 50,000 homeless veterans are starving dying in the streets, but liberals want to invite 620,000 refugees and settle them among us. We have to take care of our own citizens, and it must be the primary goal for our politicians!"" That post reached the news feeds of 724,323 Facebook users. The most explicitly political of the posts may be from Secured Borders, which routinely refers to Clinton as “Killary” instead of Hillary.
Many of the posts Abright collected went viral, reaching tens or hundreds of thousands of Facebook news feeds, often by posing a question or calling for a response — tools known to people savvy in the use of social media. “Issues that divide and outrage tend to spread the most, which is a common theme in social networks,” he said. One final insight from Albright’s research: To the extent there is a discernible political motive in them, the goal seemed less to inspire enthusiasm for one candidate than to dampen support for voting at all. This fits with what many other researchers and investigators have said about the Russian disinformation campaign, that it drove directly at the fractures in American society and sought to widen them. “A lot of these posts had the intent to get people not to vote,” Albright said. “This is a concerted effort of manipulation. Based on the engagement and reach and the outcome of the election .. I’d say it’s been fairly successful, sadly.""

"On Thursday, a reporter from New York Times said that Sean Hannity, the conservative TV host might be the next Fox News employee to be ejected from the network, after Bill O’Reilly’s shocking decision to his job after allegations of sexual harassment.
Times reported Jeremy Peters pointed a report from 2010 about Fox, which included a quote where it is said that few of the Murdock family didn’t like how the network was being run.
Fox is owned by a corporation that is managed by top executives Rupert Murdoch and his two sons.
Peters said, “I think you have to look at somebody like Sean Hannity and question whether or not his almost propaganda-like attitude and programming every night is going to be acceptable in the minds of the family which is clearly trying to shift the network in another direction.”
The host Hannity is mostly known as the biggest President Trump’s champion in TV news, and almost never could be heard from him any criticism about the White House. Now that O’Reilly left Fox, Hannity is the longest running host in the prime-time lineup.
Last summer, Roger Ailes was also pressured to leave the network after multiple women blamed him for sexual harassment.
The network’s reorganization is now led by Lachlan and James Murdoch, who were trying to reposition the top-rank cable news channel, widely known for its conservative bent.
What do you think about this?",1
"Christian Rudder, one of the founders of the online dating site OkCupid, got himself into a tangle a few weeks ago when he announced in a blog post, “We Experiment on Human Beings!” OkCupid had wanted to find out if its assertion of compatibility influenced how compatible couples could be. “To test this, we took pairs of bad matches...and told them they were exceptionally good for each other,” Rudder wrote. (He neglected to say that people have been doing this to friends and relatives for centuries.) As it turned out, being set up by OkCupid was enough to inspire bad matches to exchange nearly as many messages as good matches typically do. Rudder wrote, “When we tell people they are a good match, they act as if they are. Even when they should be wrong for each other.” Call it the If You Say So romance, and chalk it up to the trust people put in the site’s matching algorithms, or to the possibility that the algorithms aren’t trustworthy at all. Or maybe it’s just that wrongness takes a while to reveal itself. (One date? Seven years? A lifetime?)
Rudder fessed up to all this because it seemed germane, in light of the controversy surrounding Facebook’s recent admission that it had tweaked news feeds to test how negative or positive news affects people—what they repost and how it travels. He promptly took a beating. One journalist called him a sociopath. Another likened OkCupid to a restaurant that had intentionally poisoned its patrons. Many people thought that it was cruel to toy with human relationships, and that it was typically arrogant of a tech executive not to recognize this.
Ten days later, Rudder sat munching on raw cauliflower at a midtown bar. He had been thinking about the word “experiment,” which seems, despite its implicit virtues, to leave a sinister aftertaste, a residue of Mengele, Milgram, and frog dissections in middle school. “There’s no question that Web sites experiment on people,” he said. “People justifiably find that weird. But these experiments are so minor. They’re more like a chef changing a spice. So you use dill instead of cumin. It might be gross, but it might be delicious.” He’d assumed that on some level his revelation wouldn’t be taken as a revelation—that the world knew by now that Internet companies collate and analyze data about their users, and often manipulate behavior, in an attempt to refine their services or to achieve world domination. For better or worse, it’s part of the compact (and the terms of use): free service in exchange for personal information.
Rudder has written a book on the subject, called “Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One’s Looking).” In it, he doesn’t wring or clap his hands over the big-data phenomenon (see N. S.A., Google ads, that sneaky Fitbit) so much as plunge them into big data and attempt to pull strange creatures from the murky depths. Here’s one: in U.S. Google searches, the most common word to follow the phrase “Is my husband...” is “gay.” It is ten times more common than “depressed.” It won’t be long before Google will be able to provide the answer. Right now, just from your pattern of likes on Facebook (and without relying on status updates or comments), an algorithm can determine with eighty-eight-per-cent accuracy whether you are straight or gay. Sixty per cent of the time, it can tell whether your parents were divorced before you turned twenty-one. Rudder calls this trove of data “an irresistible sociological opportunity.” He writes, “You know the science is headed to undiscovered country when someone can hear your parents fighting in the click-click-click of a mouse.”
Rudder, who is thirty-eight, grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas, and, like his fellow OkCupid founders, majored in math at Harvard. He’s a “Magic: The Gathering” nut and a bit of a Luddite; he’s never been on an online date (he’s been married for eight years). He’s still a member of the indie rock band Bishop Allen, although he’s not going on its forthcoming tour. “This is the difference between being in a band and being the author of a nonfiction book,” he told his bandmate Justin Rice the other day. “When you’re in a band, there’s a guy with a microphone who’s asking you questions. When you write a book, there’s a guy with a microphone who’s trying to argue with you.”
But back to that argument: If the Internet is one giant experiment, are we all just lab rats? “I prefer the analogy of a glass-bottomed boat,” Rudder said. He derived the word “dataclysm” from the Greek word kataklysmos, for the Great Flood. He’d like for this current inundation, like Noah’s, to be thought of not just as an agent of destruction, “an unprecedented deluge,” but as a means of renewal, one that will wash away our old limited understanding of how people actually think and behave. The power of suggestion is strong. Dinner and a movie?",0

"Four key Las Vegas shooting witnesses are now missing or dead, and they all have one thing in common – their version of events contradicts the official narrative.
Are they being silenced to stop the truth coming out?
Kymberley Suchomel, one of the key witnesses to the devastating Las Vegas shooting attack which left fifty-eight people dead and more than five hundred wounded, has been found dead in her home at the age of 28. The cause of her death has yet to be confirmed.
Kymberley Suchomel was one of the lucky attendees at the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas who managed to escape the hail of bullets without being injured. Shortly after fleeing the scene with friends, she made a statement to mainstream media claiming that there were “multiple gunmen” firing weapons into the crowd and that she was chased by one such man.
When she was questioned on the veracity of her story, given the official story that there was only one gunman, she said that she was more than “100% sure” that she was right.
WHY IS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA NOT REPORTING THIS?
Kymberley gave a very detailed account of what she had seen in the days following the horrific event in which she questioned the official narrative being pushed relentlessly by the mainstream media, despite the fact it doesn’t make any sense.
Writing on Facebook, Kymberley said that she had been watching the news with her family constantly since she had arrived home. She said the official narrative contained blatant lies, and expressed frustration that mainstream media was silencing the voices of survivors.
More information about Kymberley Suchomel can be found here.
In a disturbing turn of events, it has emerged that Kymberley is not the only key witness to have died since the Las Vegas shooting.
1) John Beilman, who was wanted by federal agents following the discovery of a communications device in the hotel room of the officially identified shooter Stephen Paddock, killed both himself and his disabled daughter in an apparent murder-suicide.
2) Chad Nishimura, a Mandalay Bay valet who parked Paddock’s car when he arrived at the hotel, has also disappeared without trace after giving a statement to a Hawaiian mainstream news network, KITV4, about his brush with the killer. Nishimura directly contradicted the official narrative by claiming that Paddock arrived at the hotel with “not many bags” – certainly nowhere near enough to hold the amount of weapons and ammunition that was found in Paddock’s hotel suite.
3) It has also been revealed that “hero” security guard Jesus Campos has also gone missing. Fifteen minutes before his scheduled appearance on Fox News – his first media interview since the shooting – Campos supposedly ran away, and hasn’t been seen or heard from since.
It has also been revealed that photos featuring Campos, published in mainstream media, are not real. After putting the photographs through forensic testing at FotoForensics.com, it is clear these photographs have been photoshopped, raising the question of whether “Jesus Campos, hero security guard” really exists.
OOPS forgot to wipe properties of 1 of the photos? Date photoshopped, 9 Oct. Date of awards night, 10 Oct. Please explain! #LasVegasShooting pic.twitter.com/a9TGlQpN0g
Whether this series of disturbing deaths and disappearances are purely coincidental or whether there is something deeply sinister afoot has yet to be determined, but the response by law enforcement and mainstream media – in particular their refusal to address the questions that the informed public want answered – is leading many to arrive at the same conclusion.
There is a major cover up afoot.",1

Breitbart News began the process to secure permanent and official Capitol Hill credentials in November. | Getty
Standing committee members raise questions about its leadership, ties to the Mercers.
The congressional Standing Committee of Correspondents on Monday delayed a decision on whether to grant permanent credentials to Breitbart News, saying members were not satisfied with the information provided thus far regarding the right-wing website’s connections to the White House and the Republican mega-donor family the Mercers.
Breitbart News, the site once run by President Donald Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon, began the process to secure permanent and official Capitol Hill credentials in November. Within the process to secure credentials is a clause that states the person and organization holding the pass ""must not be engaged in any lobbying or paid advocacy, advertising, publicity or promotion work for any individual, political party, corporation, organization, or agency of the U. S. government.”
As a result, the site, which is known to keep information about its funding and ownership quiet, revealed in a past meeting that the owners are Breitbart CEO Larry Solov, founder Andrew Breitbart's widow, Susie Breitbart, and the Republican megadonor family the Mercers, including patriarch Bob Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer, who is close to Trump. Breitbart's family owns the largest stake.
Breitbart News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The congressional passes are often the first step to acquiring other important press passes, including for the White House and political events. Breitbart currently has temporary credentials, but permanent credentials would prevent them from having to go through a renewal process every few months.
In the previous meeting, the committee requested more information on Breitbart’s leadership, which is not readily available on its site, as well as more information on when and how Bannon left the site. In a letter to the committee that was shared with journalists attending the meeting, Solov said Bannon resigned from Breitbart “on or about” Nov. 13, 2016 and that he has “no editorial executive, financial or other role or interest” in the site. Solov, at the committee’s request, also provided a masthead of the site which is not available on its website.
Of concern to the committee was the presence on the masthead of at least two people, Senior Editor-at-large Peter Schweizer and Managing Editor Wynton Hall, who are both also both part of the Mercer-funded Government Accountability Institute founded by Bannon and Schweizer. The GAI and the work they produce, would not be in line with the committee’s guidelines for credentialing, the committee said.
“We can’t even get an exact date Bannon resigned, on or about Nov. 13, even so, some officers and top editors at Breitbart may or may not have continued relations directly with Bannon and another organizations, even being paid,” said the standing committee chairman, Billy House from Bloomberg News. “Even if Bannon is no longer involved in GAI, top editors are involved in this other group, an advocacy group.”

“It’s not that unusual that an Arianna Huffington, or Michael Bloomberg, these people are engaged in political activities. But it’s when the editorial masthead is full of people with dual roles who are also doing advocacy, that is a problem,” said committee secretary Joseph Morton of the Omaha-World Herald.
The committee also expressed concerns over the Mercers, who are not listed on Breitbart’s masthead. The committee noted recent news reports including a New Yorker article which said that Rebekah Mercer does not ""dictate a political line to the editors, but often points out areas of coverage that she thinks require more attention.""
In the meeting on Monday, the committee, composed of five journalists, also expressed frustration that Breitbart submitted the requested information at the last minute and may have misled the committee on where their offices are located.
A Capitol Hill townhouse, known as the “Breitbart Embassy,” had been provided as the address of the company’s Washington office, and the committee was told Breitbart was leasing the space as a “mixed use” place for both corporate housing (often where Bannon stayed), events and office space. But the committee noted that the townhouse is not technically zoned for commercial use and that the owner of the house filed taxes as the sole occupant, meaning that a commercial lease would not even be legally possible. (Most Breitbart writers work remotely, and the site has said they are seeking new office space.)
Breitbart’s current credentials are temporary, though the committee agreed to extend their credentials for two more months while asking Breitbart to submit further information by April 18. That information includes further explanations on the two masthead members who are also part of GAI, further explanations into the Mercers role with the site, clarification on Breitbart’s office space and its past lease.

How Republicans Stopped Pretending and Started Getting Real
What Donald Trump Doesn’t Get About Pittsburgh",0
"Late Saturday, Facebook user Scott Kotesky said he had what he called the “craziest experience ever on an airplane.” Kotesky said he had a somewhat harrowing experience when he boarded a flight going from Baltimore to Seattle. It seems he sat next to a woman who apparently didn’t like President Donald Trump. In no time, she began berating him, telling him that she would throw up in his lap because he supports the new president.
Eventually, the woman was removed from the airplane for her conduct.
I had an upgraded seat that I paid a little extra for because of the long 6 hour flight. As I approach my row I smile and motion to the husband and wife sitting in the aisle and middle seat that Imy (sic) seat was next to the window. I put my backpack in the overhead and the wife with a very stern voice says to me:
“Did you come here to cheer or to protest?”
“I came here to celebrate democracy ma’am”
… I knew this was going to be a long flight at this point. She then proceeded with: (somewhat paraphrased as my memory allows)
Her: “You put a crazed man in charge of the nuclear codes! You should be ashamed!”
Me: ‘Well we’re all entitled to our opinions here ma’am.”
Her: “And I’m entitled to get drunk and puke in your lap! I’m going to throw up right in your lap! You make me sick! Don’t talk to me! Don’t look at me! Don’t you dare even put your arm on that rest. You disgust me! You should be ashamed of yourself! You put a maniac’s finger on the button” (assuming she’s means nukes). You are a bigot. You should get off this plane!”
Me: “ma’am, by definition, bigotry is disparaging someone prior to knowing them simply by their beliefs and opinions. Thank you for being the very thing you preach against.”
She the proceeded with other various rantings such as my lack of critical thinking and other insults. Finally a flight attendant came over as you will see in the video followed by a supervisor informing that she would have to deboard the plane per captains orders.
After much fuss, airport police came and removed her from the plane. The lady across from me filmed that and was gracious to sent it to me. Many others around me defended me insisting the lady had caused all the commotion and was verbally assaulting not just me but others wearing various Trump apparel boarding the plane.",1

It’s also believed that Hannity has become a target due to his coverage of the Seth Rich story. What does the left not want Sean to find?
MediaEqualizer:
“After a two decade run, is the end of Sean Hannity’s Fox News Channel program near?
Based on unusually strong hints from the host himself, the answer appears to be yes.
Under internal pressure over his pursuit of the truth behind the Seth Rich story, network suits are apparently closing in on one of the network’s remaining conservative holdouts.
In his opening segment tonight, Hannity told viewers, “I promise that I will continue to tell the truth. As for my future at Fox News, Media Matters is attacking. The Left is organizing an advertising boycott. I will continue to do my job to the best of my ability. I serve at the pleasure of Fox News.”
More ominously, he concluded at 11pm by saying, “hopefully, I will see you again tomorrow night.”
Before the program, he had tweeted a cryptic message regarding his future there:
Last last point! Just got off the phone with 3 of my attorneys. You may think I have Lost it, but they are so amazing. #StopLiberalFascism
— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 24, 2017
Earlier, Fox retracted news coverage regarding Rich’s 2016 murder, which has intrigued many political followers since the DNC staffer’s body was found last summer. And there is widespread evidence that Rupert Murdoch’s sons, who now run its day-to-day operation, are fully committed to permanently wiping away its conservative programming.
#StandWithSean, an effort led by StopTheScalpings Co-founder Melanie Morgan, is continuing its efforts to stand by Hannity while he is under fire. This writer is also part of the organization.
On the group’s Facebook page, Morgan told followers, “Hannity is under a REAL threat but he promised to tell the truth, and continue at Fox as long as they let him. Hannity has told me personally that he is making some strategic moves, and this has to do with the Seth Rich murder case.”
“Sean Hannity is one smart, wily, fierce fighter. He needs our support even more now. There is turmoil and dissension at Fox News,” she added.
Since radio and television hosts rarely have a chance to say goodbye to their longtime audiences, tonight’s show may have been intended to do just that.”

"""Got to do something about these missing children grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents – fast trial, death penalty.""
It’s been clear to me for awhile that Trump would make human trafficking a top priority. On October 8, 2012, Trump tweeted:
Free republic reports: As a strong advocate for sex crime victims, I’ve been closely following the pedophile arrests since Trump took office. There has been a staggering 1,500-plus arrest in one short month; compare that to less than 400 sex trafficking-related arrests in 2014 according to the FBI.
Attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recently stated he would not back down from ongoing pedophile investigations despite attempts from the Democrats and the media to derail his investigations and forcing him to resign.
But despite the huge achievement, the media have remained silent on the issue.

But despite the huge achievement, the media have remained silent on the issue.
My suspicions were confirmed on Feb. 23 when Trump gave a press conference from the White House addressing how human trafficking is a “dire problem” domestically and internationally. He gave further confirmation when he said: “Dedicated men and women across the federal government have focused on this for some time as you know -- it’s been much more focused over the last four weeks.”
Trump’s press conference was barely a blip in the mainstream media and the massive arrests have been almost completely ignored by the MSM altogether. Here’s a rundown of some of the massive sex trafficking rings that have been broken up since Trump took office.
-On Jan. 27 authorities arrested 42 in a human trafficking operation in Tennessee.
-On Jan. 29 authorities announced that 474 were arrested in a statewide California human trafficking operation and 28 sexually exploited children were rescued.
-108 were arrested from Jan. 18 to Feb. 5 in Illinois as part of a national sex trafficking sting operation.
- 178 people were arrested in Texas for sex trafficking in sting that operated in January till Super Bowl Sunday.
-16 people were arrested in January in Michigan for sex trafficking during the Detroit Auto Show.
-In February, authorities arrested 11 in Virginia in a child sex sting.
-On Feb. 14 the Polk County sheriff announced that 42 were arrested in Florida in child pornography related cases.
As the MSM has ignored these historical arrests, they have zeroed in on casting conservative icon Milo Yiannopoulos as a monster. They claim he supports pedophilia based on comments he made in a video years ago. The reality is Milo was a victim of child sex abuse, and although he did joke about his abuse in an interview, he in no way promotes pedophilia. The opposite is true, and he addressed this controversy head on in a press conference. Not only is it normal for sex abuse victims to make light of their abuse as a coping mechanism, Milo has personally taken down and exposed pedophiles in his columns over the years. However, the mainstream media and the left ignored this information and demonized Milo. The irony of all this is that the left and MSM have been the biggest proponents of pedophilia. Salon has published articles attempting to normalize pedophilia; however, to maintain their faux outrage over Milo, they deleted them. The face of the very fake news network CNN, Jake Tapper, fired off several tweets condemning Milo. For example, he tweeted:
""My friend, a survivor of sex trafficking: ""Milo straight up defended abusing 13 yr old boys...Please don't let that be normalized""
If Tapper is so concerned with sex trafficking, why in the world hasn’t he covered the massive sex trafficking arrests that have taken place since Trump took office? It seems he, and many in the leftist media, are only concerned with sex trafficking if it can be used to destroy a conservative.
After the MSM went after Milo, he was disinvited to speak at CPAC and his book deal was pulled. Let’s contrast this with one of the left’s heroes, Lena Dunham, who was a staunch and vocal Hillary Clinton supporter during her campaign. She got a $3.5 million book deal. In her book, she literally bragged about how she molested her little sister and made false claims that a conservative raped her in college. Has Fake Tapper or anyone in the MSM ever expressed outrage over her? Of course not!
Milo told this column that once one realizes the MSM “cares nothing for real victims and only wants its ideological enemies destroyed, this behavior becomes intelligible. Journalists don’t care about children. They care about damaging their political enemies.” Milo is absolutely right. This is why we’ve heard nothing from the MSM about the mass sex trafficking arrests and this will continue unless a conservative can be targeted.
The good news is that we have a president who genuinely does care about children and he’s vowed to make solving the human trafficking epidemic a priority. The recent pedophile arrests are just the tip of the iceberg and, whether Tapper and his ilk in the MSM like it or not, this story will eventually get so big that they will be forced to cover this horrific epidemic that has plagued our country for too damn long.",1

Review of ""How the Right Lost Its Mind"" by Charles J. Sykes        HOW THE RIGHT LOST ITS MIND  After Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election, Republican Party honchos released a 100-page report, nicknamed the “autopsy,” trying to figure out where the GOP went wrong. It’s the kind of thing you do when you lose. But how about when you win and kind of wish you hadn’t? “In victory,” Charles J. Sykes writes of the latest presidential race, “conservatives will need something very different — an exorcism of the forces that have possessed and, ultimately, distorted conservatism.” Instead of examining a corpse, today the GOP must battle its demons. Sykes, a conservative true believer and former talk-radio host in Wisconsin, earned the wrath of Donald Trump’s supporters when he criticized the Republican front-runner early in the race, calling him “a cartoon version of every leftist/media negative stereotype of the reactionary, nativist, misogynist right.” On the radio and on social media, Sykes was branded “a sellout, a traitor, a Judas,” he recalls, for not boarding the Trump Train. In “How the Right Lost Its Mind,” Sykes has written a sort of “What Happened” for conservatives. The culprits are not James Comey, Vladimir Putin or a reality television opponent, but the return of “crackpotism” on the right; the fecklessness of conservative media, political and religious figures; and the rise of a distorted worldview in which Trump’s overwhelming character flaws mattered little to a base that behaved as though civilization was in play in his election.  The result is a political environment that “has coarsened the culture as a whole,” Sykes writes. In his eyes, the election marked “the abandonment of respect for gradualism, civility, expertise, intelligence, and prudence — the values that were once taken for granted among conservatives.” It is a sanitized image of conservatism, no doubt, but Sykes seems heartfelt in his lament. The insanity he purports to chronicle — on the book cover, the title is stitched across a red baseball cap — did not begin in 2016 or 2015, or even during this young millennium. Sykes reminisces about the mid-20th century, when his hero, William F. Buckley Jr., was casting out Birchers and Ayn Rand devotees from the conservative movement, and when Barry Goldwater’s “The Conscience of a Conservative” sought to balance, as the senator wrote, “the maximum amount of individual freedom that is consistent with the maintenance of social order.” But today’s conservatives have failed to do the same. They have tolerated the ruminations of Pat Robertson, for instance, whom Sykes dismisses as “Christianity’s crazy uncle,” and embraced the more extreme elements among the tea party movement. “For years, we ignored the birthers, the racists, the truthers, and other conspiracy theorists,” Sykes writes. “We treated them like your obnoxious uncle at Thanksgiving.” (Yes, he seems to have uncle issues.) Throughout the book, Sykes assails Republicans and conservatives for not pushing back hard enough against the crackpots — and he points to moments along the way that only emboldened them. [Is Trump mentally ill? Or is America? Psychiatrists weigh in.] John McCain’s choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate on the 2008 Republican ticket. The Drudge Report’s decision to link to — and thus validate — the ravings of InfoWars’ Alex Jones. The creation of Heritage Action for America, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, which affirmed the think tank’s move away from substantive policy work. Even the decision by the American Conservative Union to uninvite Milo Yiannopoulos from its 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference, after the alt-right former Breitbart editor was captured on video defending pedophilia, carries powerful symbolism. “While the advocacy of pedophilia was a bridge too far, the conservative group had been willing to overlook Yiannopoulos’s racism, anti-Semitism, Alt Right Nazi trolling, and his bullying,” Sykes reminds. “Lines had been crossed; far from being expelled, the Alt Right had been normalized.” Sykes’s biggest target is Rush Limbaugh, whom the author says abandoned conservative principles to promote Trump’s candidacy. “Few figures in the Right’s media ecosystem did more to enable the billionaire’s rise,” Sykes writes. “For years, Limbaugh was a leading enforcer of conservative orthodoxy and ideological purity, which made his ideological pirouette in recent years so remarkable.” He quotes Limbaugh defending Trump’s insults of McCain. He cites Limbaugh explaining away the candidate’s unsubstantiated claims of New Jersey Muslims cheering the 9/11 attacks. He chastises him for providing “valuable air cover” for voices from the alt-right (a small, far-right movement that espouses white supremacy). And he suggests that Limbaugh did it all for pecuniary, self-interested reasons. “With his audience aging and shrinking, the reality from a business perspective was that Limbaugh could simply not afford to stand against the populist tide,” Sykes writes. It’s a credible critique, but so relentless that at times it comes off like some tiff within the radio-host fraternity. Sykes’s perch as a former popular radio personality should give him an insider’s perspective into the travails of the conservative movement, yet the book feels oddly distant. Where he could provide first-hand accounts of what it was like to watch conservatives embrace a less-than-conservative standard-bearer, Sykes instead relies on news reports and interviews describing how he felt. So in Sykes’s own book, we read interview passages from Politico and The Washington Post and Fox News telling us how surprised Sykes was by the evolving views of his longtime listeners, or how he regarded Trump during the campaign, or how Wisconsinite sensibilities matched up with the GOP field. Yes, it’s cool to have been interviewed by the national media, but why don’t you just tell us all this yourself? [A tale of the 2016 campaign, with rallies, rage and plenty of beer] Sykes also draws heavily on the analysis and reporting of political journalists and intellectuals such as Bill Bishop, Conor Friedersdorf, Nicole Hemmer, Gabriel Sherman, Ross Douthat, Jonah Goldberg, Reihan Salam, Bret Stephens and even (oh my) former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau. Their arguments are worthy and relevant, but at times the strength of the book — the bracing and immediate insights of someone deep within the conservative movement — is weakened. “In 2008, conservatives ridiculed the Left for its adulation of Barack Obama,” Sykes recalls, “only to succumb to their own cult of personality eight years later.” They succumbed, he believes, because they came to regard the opposition party, and Hillary Clinton in particular, as the embodiment of all evil. “In this binary world, where everything is at stake, everything is in play, there is no room for quibbles about character, or truth, or principles.” Think of it: If the Supreme Court, the Constitution and human survival all depend on your side winning, “then nothing else really matters,” Sykes concludes. Even religious conservatives fell into the trap. “The essential error of the Christian Right was to give politics primacy over faith,” the author writes. Sykes seems conflicted over how harshly to judge Trump voters, especially on race. At one point he deems it unfair to “impugn guilt by association” to voters who may have other reasons for supporting Trump. But elsewhere he writes that it is “undeniable ... that a great number of American conservatives have proven themselves willing to tolerate and even accept racism,” whether or not they harbor such feelings themselves. Sykes decries the alt-right forces for their “open embrace of undiluted racism” and conservatives for their willingness to inject “toxic sludge” into the American mainstream for the sake of an electoral win. “If the conservative movement is defined by the nativist, authoritarian, post-truth culture of Trump-Bannon-Drudge-Hannity-Palin,” he writes, “then I’m out.” Instead, he calls for fellow “contrarian conservatives” to return to first principles, revitalize their policy proposals, break free from the influence of lobbyists and address the “legitimate grievances” of Trump supporters while separating them from the authoritarian and racist elements of Trump’s base. Obvious and generic recommendations, maybe, though that hardly makes them wrong. It is not clear who might lead this resistance from the right, however, with so many party leaders and thinkers compromised by Trumpism. Buckley is no longer around to serve as a gatekeeper for the party, Sykes laments, though he acknowledges that it’s hard for anyone to take on such a role in today’s fractured media environment. But to perform an exorcism, you need a priest. The conservative movement doesn’t have one. The Trump base doesn’t want one. And the Republican Party has already made its deal with the devil.

"Snopes.com has been allegedly fact-checking articles on the internet since 2002. By 2005, reports that the site had an obvious liberal bias began to surface. They fought back by claiming they were non-political Canadians, but it was discovered that the original founders were actually Democratic activists who raised money for Al Gore.
In 2006, they sold the site to supposedly unbiased reporters who spent the next year making sure all of their articles were indisputable in order to build their credibility. Now, more than 10 years later, Snopes is used by news organizations and social media platforms to determine what is fake news and what is not.
This morning, after an extensive investigation by Fox News at the request of the White House, it was proven that Snopes doesn’t just have a liberal bias but has been establishing itself for years for the sole purpose of providing counterintelligence against the next Republican president.Now that Trump has won, conservative news has been being tagged as fake news by Snopes in staggering numbers. In conjunction with Facebook, Snopes has become how fake news is flagged. After this morning’s revelation, Snopes is reportedly shutting down and printing retractions for nearly 1500 pieces of conservative news that was purposely flagged as fake to hide the truth from the American people.
Let that sink in. One single website was able to build enough of a reputation that everything they print is taken as gospel. Liberals have certainly figured out how to use the media as a weapon. They tell the story and their own source confirms it. It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before in America.

"Mass Muslim immigration is causing tremendous tension in the countries to which they are going. It’s no wonder since the majority are used to the harsh, backward conditions of their Islamic based homelands. They just have no ability to actually assimilate. That’s why Trump is proposing to create safe areas in the countries from which they are fleeing.
In the meantime, many countries have a huge problem to deal with. From FFS media:
It’s so much easier to support these people when you don’t have to deal with them everyday.
When these ideological liberals have finally lost everything to a Muslim gang, however, they will then know their mistake.
Some will experience a “trigger event” and become instant conservative “populists.” Others, like the brain-dead German feminist hoisting a sign that read, “Will Trade Racists for Rapists,” will never learn.
Sorry, but this millennial donkey is irredeemable and deserves her fate — worse, she’s asking for it.
The insanity of the left and feminism never ceases to amaze.
As the EU continues to crash and burn under the dead weight of Third World immigration, only Hungary seems willing and able to stem the tide.
The government has cracked down with a ban on the construction of mosques and the muslim call to prayer. The burqa and the burkini have been outlawed and a 100-mile razor wire fence has been set up to keep the migrants out.
In the small town of Asotthalom, Mayor Laszlo Toroczkail declared Hungary “a bad choice for migrants.” He’s ordered patriotic Hungarian bounty hunters to go out and round-up all the illegals they can find for deportation.
Hungarian men dressed in camo-gear riding motorcycles, on horseback or in helicopters have been scouring the countryside in search of illegals. The Muslim interlopers have been found sleeping in gardens and in outbuildings as they continue their relentless migration to various destinations inside the EU.
Once caught the illegals are wrestled to the ground and hog-tied. Humiliating, yes, but then again, think of the hundreds of European woman who have been assaulted and violated by Muslim rapists and gangs.
When a nation’s government fails to protect its citizenry from the harm caused by outsiders harboring ill intent, you can expect the locals will take matters into their own hands. It’s just as good when a democratically elected mayor sends in the bounty hunters.
To the anti-migrant vigilantes and bounty hunters of Hungary, we say — “giddyup!”
Please share this on Facebook if you support the Hungarian mayor who sent bounty hunters to round-up illegals.",1

"There is no end to the problems of Fox News! As if some curse is happening this year to the network!
First their CEO, Roger Ailes has to quit his job after allegations of sexual harassment, then Megyn Kelly left the network, then Greta Van Susteren left to MSNBC.
Now their biggest star, Bill O’Reilly is having problems with the court!
Lawyers for Juliet Huddy, a longtime Fox News host, sent a letter to the network in August alleging that O’Reilly made inappropriate phone calls to her and once tried to kiss her when she visited his home, according to the report.
The letter also brought allegations against current Fox News co-president Jack Abernethy, whom she claimed retaliated against her after she rejected his advances.
Huddy, who once had a regular weekly guest spot on the top-rated “O’Reilly Factor,” alleged in a lawsuit threat obtained by LawNewz that she was removed from the primetime program “in retaliation for rebuffing Mr. O’Reilly’s advances” despite having “one of the highest rated segments.”
Bill O’Reilly is a huge star on this network! But this is a bad situation so he has to apologize for this on his show!
His millions of fans are family people, conservatives, so this is bad attitude and bad decisions! He has to turn to Christianity and learn again how to act toward people!
He is divorced, he lost custody of his kids, so he is a bad example to America! He should come back again on the right track!
We, the media, have to be a great example to young generations, we have to show them by example how to leave their life!
They have to respect women at work, they have to be family oriented and professional at work!!!",1
"CNN has been in hot water this week after they hunted down the creator of President Donald Trump’s now-infamous wrestling gif. Twitter users have accusedCNN’s Andrew Kaczynski and his team of blackmailing Reddit user “HanA**holeSolo,” who allegedly created the gif.
CNNforced Mr. “Solo” to apologize for allegedlypostinganti-Semitic messages before issuing a controversial threat,“CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.” However, this comment completely backfired, as the network was accused of extortion.
In the wake of CNN being exposed as the fake news network that it is, a hilarious clip has surfaced of CNN anchor Don Lemon being confronted about knowingly spreading these lies.Talking Points Memoreported that the clip above this story shows an enraged Lemon cutting off a guest after he claims CNN is reporting “fake news.”
Lemon was moderating a discussion aboutfrequent trips away from the White House and the costs of them to taxpayers whenParis Dennard, a former staffer in the George W. Bush administration and now a political analyst and commentator, called the story “fake news”
“The President is not breaking any laws, and he’s not doing anything,” Dennard said.
“Fake news is when you put out a story to intentionally deceive someone and you know that it is wrong,” Lemon interjected. “This story that we’re doing right now is not to intentionally deceive anyone. We are simply talking about the cost to keep a President safe.”
“Please stop it with that stupid talking point, that it is a fake news story,” Lemon said. “If you don’t want to participate in the news stories on this network, then don’t come on and participate. But don’t call them fake because you don’t agree with them. Go on.”
“Don, this is a fake news story, in my opinion,” Dennard fired back, “because the underlying assumption is that— ”
“Okay, Paris, thank you very much everyone,” Lemon interrupted, ending the segment. “Thanks everyone, thanks for watching. Have a great weekend. Goodnight, all.”

"WOW! This is a great news folks! Finally Trump team is taking control in federal government! Now we are expecting similar activities in CIA, NSA and FBI!

Many of those let go were on the building’s seventh floor — top-floor bigs — a symbolically important sign to the rest of the diplomatic corps that their new boss has different priorities than the last one.
GREAT JOB REX! That’s what we were expecting for so long! Now Trump should clean more the White House so there is not going to be more leaking.
We look as complete amateurs and losers to the world when presidents talks with world leaders are leaking out like candies! We are talking about our commander in chief, he should be protected under many layers of secrecy and professionalism.
We have to stop the leaking, Trump team have to unite all federal government behind Trump so that he could focus on his campaign promises!
Now he is being stabbed every day in the back, he is bleeding all day, this looks very bad now! Trump need help, he need supporters in the government, and his enemies out of the government!
He is going to manage all of this mess, he will win this, he is the best! He will who everybody that he is going to be the best president ever!!!",1
"We’ve all grown weary of FBI Director James Comey’s antics lately, as the elected official continues to play politics rather than simply doing his damn job. This was evidenced recently as he went along with the left’s narrative of a “collusion” between Trump and the Russians while under oath, even though there still remains zero evidence to back up this ridiculous nonsense. Well now in a sick story just making headlines, a young teenage sexual abuse victim is going public with the highly disturbing that that happened to her last year when the ‘Weinergate’ scandal was rocking Hillary Clinton’s campaign that’s sure to put Comey’s name on America’s $h*tlist even further.
For whatever reason, disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner just can’t stop snapping pics of his junk and sending it to underage girls. His latest victim was a 15-year-old girl that Weiner hadpreyed upon, knowing full-well that the girl was udnerage and still in high school. But not long after enduring being targetedby a nasty Weiner, she wasabusedyet again after what FBI Director James Comey did to her throughout the ‘Weinergate’ scandal. In a scathing letter, the teen said that Comey “victimized” her and through his reckless actions, “helped the abuse at the hands of Anthony Weiner to continue.”
After grilling the teenager for7 several long hours over the horrifying ordeal, rather than protecting her identity, Comey they released her name to the press, where she then became the target of their incessant requests for information. She was then the target of vicious attacks, having to relive the embarrassing ordeal over and over. Check out her scathing letter, which is now starting to go viral:
I am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators.
Your letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didn’t you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me.
In your letter, you chose to use a vague approach, meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how. Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my “story.” Why couldn’t your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle?
In his “cooperation” with you and with his love of the spotlight, Anthony Weiner has given information that led to the media finding me. You have assisted him in further victimizing me on every news outlet. I can only assume that you saw an opportunity for political propaganda.
I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters’ phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election.
Anthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my “story” the goal of every reporter? When I meet with my therapist next time, she will already know what we are going to talk about before I get there by reading Friday, October 28th, 2016’s New York Times article.
I may have been Weiner’s victim, but the real story here is that I am a survivor. I am strong, intelligent, and certain that I will come out from under this nightmare, but it will not be as a result of your doing your job to protect me. I hope that by making my letter to you public, you will think about how your actions affect the victims of the crimes you are investigating. The election is important, yes, but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me, is much more important. It’s time that the FBI Director puts his victims’ rights above political views.

The teenage victim of Anthony Weiner’s heinous pornography crime is speaking out against the FBI’s abuse and release of her identity to the public.
TruePundit reported: The teenager at the center of the child pornography case of disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner penned a scathing letter to FBI Director James Comey, after his agents grilled the youth for over seven hours and then released the minor’s identity to the news media and others instead of shielding the now 16-year-old girl’s identity.
Just what you would expect from a corrupt politician using the head of the FBI as a perfect cover. True Pundit originally broke this story wide open in November 2016. Since then, the girl involved in the case put pen to paper and tore into the FBI and Comey for its partisan handling of her case which she believes was politicized to benefit Comey.
The girl’s family has since released this letter to selected media outlets including True Pundit and updated its content. We have gone out of our way to respect the girl’s privacy and have not asked for an interview. We are not interested in further exploiting her plight. Unfortunately, according to the North Carolina high school junior (sophomore during Weiner relationship), the same cannot be said for the FBI and Comey.
The victim’s own harsh words should likewise serve notice to defectors in the media who defended Weiner and Clinton last week after True Pundit published an expose detailing that Hillary was well aware of Weiner’s sextcapades with the youth during her presidential campaign but did nothing to protect her.

"Priti Patel has resigned as international development secretary over her unauthorised meetings while on holiday in Israel. It followed a day of drama as she flew back from a trip to Uganda to meet the prime minister. Now, as always in such cases, the focus moves on to who will replace her.
Ms Patel is the second cabinet minister to quit in seven days, after Sir Michael Fallon stepped down as defence secretary over allegations about his behaviour. Her departure ""throws up problems"" for Theresa May, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Ms Patel is strongly pro-Brexit and the prime minister will be keen to ""preserve the delicate balance around the cabinet table"" between different factions, she adds.

There's never a good time to suffer a wound, but some might be better than others, a study suggests. A team at the UK's MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology has found that burns sustained at night took an average of 28 days to heal, while those sustained in the daytime took just 17. They say the affect of the body clock on skin cells called fibroblasts is responsible for the difference.

However, there is lots that is wrong with the idea that it can simply retreat into a ""virtual caliphate"" and hope to be as powerful as it ever was.
The smiling face of departing International Development Secretary Priti Patel is shown on most front pages.

"Since the explosion of fake news that some say swayed the 2016 presidential election, social media companies have increasingly cracked down on fabricated news and robo-accounts in an effort to rebuild trust among users.
Now news organizations are joining the fray. Ten media companies -- including The Washington Post, The Economist, the Independent Journal Review, Mic and publishers in Canada, Italy and Germany -- are rolling out a project they hope will reverse Americans' historically low confidence in the news media.
Run by the Trust Project, a consortium of news organizations, the new system consists of so-called Trust Indicators, a set of tags giving audiences the signal that an organization abides by a certain set of standards. The eight indicators explain things like an organization's ethical code, its funding, journalists' backgrounds and how they get their stories.
The project lead, journalist Sally Lehrman, describes it as a nutrition label for news.
""You can see what's in your food: how much sugar, how much iron. You can look at it and say, today, it's fine for me. Or, no, it doesn't meet my needs,"" she said. ""The public can make their own decisions based on these disclosures that are coming from the news industry itself.""
Lehrman is the senior director of journalism ethics at Santa Clara University's Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, which is hosting the Trust Project. In the process of developing the indicators, she commissioned interviews with news consumers to figure out what kinds of aspects made newspapers more or less credible.
""There are categories of folks who really do want to be informed, but they're having a hard time being able to tell what's trustworthy or not,"" she said. ""That's where we come in.""
Initially, eight indicators can be independently applied to a story. They include categorizing the type of content (separating out opinion, analysis and sponsored content); indicating the presence of citations and references for in-depth stories; showing if a story is locally sourced; and showing whether a newsroom that produced a particular piece of journalism promotes diverse perspectives.
The 10 organizations using the indicators will all implement them this month, according to the Trust Project.
Many industry observers blame the advent of the internet, and social media in particular, with creating an environment that favors salacious or grabby information over content that's factually accurate but less exciting.
""Most Americans have some trust in information they're getting from profession organizations, but very few have a lot of trust,"" said Jeffrey Gottfried, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center. ""Where that shifts is information they're getting from social media.""
People tend to trust information found on social media significantly less than information from other sources, Gottfried said. Compounding the problem, many readers -- about four in 10 -- are unable to identify the source of news stories that they click on through social media, according to Pew.
""That provides a challenge for news organizations,"" Gottfried said.
The Trust Indicators could help with that. In addition to a ""Trust"" logo that can go on a newspaper's website, the eight tags indicating a story's various aspects are machine-readable and able to appear on Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Google (GOOG), and on other search engines. Those three tech companies, along with Microsoft's (MSFT) Bing, have all agreed to use the indicators in some way, the Trust Project said.
For now, it's unknown how exactly they'll be used. Craig Newmark, one of the Trust Project's founders, suggested that Google's search algorithm could rank trusted sources above others in search results. A social network could also display a logo next to shared content to show that it comes from a trustworthy source.
But for now, it's unclear how tech companies -- which control how most Americans today find information -- will use the indicators.
And this isn't the first attempt to combat misleading news. Facebook and Twitter have publicly committed to crack down on fake information, with mixed results, and there have been calls for increased government oversight of the tech giants. This is the first such effort to come from the news industry itself, however.
""What's exciting is that all of a sudden, a whole bunch of journalism organizations are working together to do a much better job of reporting,"" Newmark said.
Newmark has in recent years made a cause of funding journalism, committing this year to giveaway $6 million through his philanthropic organization. (Newmark, who founded Craigslist, has also been criticized for his role in the migration of classified advertising to the web, which eliminated a major funding source for small newspapers.)
Of course, whether these indicators will actually foster trust in the news is an open question. In terms of the people fake news reached and the money it made, the fabricated stuff was often more successfulthis year than the real kind. Still, it appears that the need for accurate and true information hasn't quite died out. For instance, organizations working on issues concerning media integrity have seen an influx of funding in recent years.
As Newmark said: ""I just want news I can trust. I want to be able to open up a newspaper and not have to think about is this biased or false.""",0

"Even without introduction, we all are familiar with the well known legend of the WWE and an actor, Hulk Hogan. Hulk has been a wrestler for so many years before retiring and finally bacame a Hall of fame member for some time.
It has really occurred to us that rumors are flying everywhere concerning the death Hulk Hogan and so many persons has found it true so they believed that the legend is dead.
Some folks has even gone to the extent of sending his family condolences via social medias and some other forms of post.
It is revealed that the whole fake news started from facebook where a fellow posted a picture of hulk Hogan with the inscription,’ R. I.P’.
The facebook page got thousands of likes and even condolences. In the page this stated was added: “At about 11 a.m. ET on Friday (September 02, 2016), our beloved actor Hulk Hogan passed away. Hulk Hogan was born on August 11, 1953 in Augusta. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”
Well, it is my pleasure to tell you that Hulk Hogan is strong and hearty even at 63 he is still full of life. The whole facebook rumors about his death was all false and worthy to be despised. Regarding to this, Hulk Hogan’s representative posted to fans saying, “He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He’s still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,”.
Finally, whatsoever news of Hulk Hogan’s death you have filled your minds with, I urge you to get rid of them because they won’t help you in a long run. Beware of false stories most especially in social media networks.",1
"Harvey Weinstein isn't going down without a fight.
A source close to the embattled Hollywood mogul confirmed to NBC News that he will contest a move to fire him from his movie and TV company at an Oct. 17 board meeting.
The Weinstein Co., now run by Weinstein’s brother, Bob, and chief operating officer David Glasser, said in a statement Sunday that he was fired ""In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days,"" after the New York Times and New Yorker published allegations of sexual harassment or assault over the decades.
A wave of Hollywood actresses, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, came forward and alleged sexual misconduct. Actress Rose McGowan has also alleged that she was raped by the movie mogul.
Weinstein has denied the allegations that he engaged in non-consensual sex with women, and no criminal charges have been brought against him.
""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,"" Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said in a statement this week.

The news that Harvey Weinstein is fighting on despite being disgraced by Hollywood was first reported by the Hollywood website TMZ.
The beleaguered Weinstein Co. saw another board departure on Thursday evening with Richard Koenigsberg opting to step down, according to a source in a position to know. Koenigsberg is the fifth board executive to exit in the past week.
Last weekend four directors departed, including Dirk Ziff, Marc Lasry, Tim Sarnoff and Paul Tudor Jones.
The company is facing a potential crisis as a result of partners reconsidering working with the firm, which is 42 percent owned by Harvey and Bob Weinstein.
Apple has reportedly said it was suspending a biopic series ""Elvis"" from the Weinstein Co., according to Deadline. Hachette Books terminated its deal with Weinstein Books, the New York Times reported, and Amazon Studios was ""reviewing"" its relationship, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
The company denied any notion of a sale or bankruptcy, suggested by Wall Street Journal article on Friday evening. In a statement Friday, company co-chair Bob Weinstein said: ""Our banks, partners and shareholders are fully supportive of our company and it is untrue that the company or board is exploring a sale or shutdown of the company.""
The Weinstein board has said it was blindsided by the allegations. “These allegations come as an utter surprise to the Board. Any suggestion that the Board had knowledge of this conduct is false,” the Weinstein Co. board of representatives said in a statement on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is set to meet Saturday to decide if it should take any action against Harvey Weinstein.
""The Academy finds the conduct described in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to be repugnant, abhorrent, and antithetical to the high standards of the Academy and the creative community it represents. The Board of Governors will be holding a special meeting on Saturday, October 14, to discuss the allegations against Weinstein and any actions warranted by the Academy.""

At least one member, CBS Films boss Terry Press Marx, said in a Facebook post reviewed by NBC News and widely reported that she will step down if the Academy doesn't take action against Weinstein. She declined further comment to NBC News.
""If the Academy does not kick him out, I am resigning my Academy membership,"" Marx wrote.",0
"At least she was able to hold her title for a week before the horrifying truth came out…
Amanda Hanna, the Swedish-Lebanese beauty won the title of Miss Lebanon Emigrant but then had her title stripped when it was revealed that she had done something that Lebanese officials could not condone.
She went to Israel in 2016 for an academic trip.
The Lebanese pageant officials aren’t letting her keep her crown because she went to visit their neighboring country, Israel, the only Jewish state?
That is messed up.
You know what else it is?
According to the Independent, the Swedish-Lebanese winner of the Miss Lebanon Emigrant contestant was able to visit her southern neighbor with her Swedish passport. Lebanon is in a state of war with Israel, so the Lebanese government has made it illegal for any citizen to visit.
“After communicating our decision with Lebanon’s Minister of Tourism, he decided that Hanna should be stripped of her title because her visit to Israel violates our country’s laws,” a statement from the Festival to the newspaper Al Modon reads.

So many are quick to side against Israel with the BDS movement and protesting Israel’s handling of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
This will help a bit with that:
Yeah, Israel takes a lot of heat for the lack of peace in the Middle East, but that’s not fair or right.
The single barrier to peace is that many Muslim states — and many Leftists — disagree that Israel has a right to exist.
And it’s petty, closed-minded things like this that perpetuate the idea that it’s Israel that’s the problem.
By the way, this isn’t the first time that Israel has posed a problem for a Lebanese beauty queen. In 2015, Miss Lebanon, Doron Matalon, almost lost her title when she posted a selfie with Miss Israel to social media.
Miss Lebanon had posed with Miss Japan and Miss Slovenia, and Miss Lebanon claims that Miss Israel ‘photobombed’ the selfie.
And she nearly lost her crown over that.
Yo, Linda Sarsour and the  Women’s March peeps, are you going to say anything about that?
Or do you simply not care because it’s ‘just the Jews’?
Isn’t it good to know that even Beauty pageants are politicized these days?
I miss the old days when not everything was politicized.
How about you? Do you miss those days?

"The city of Las Vegas became a gruesome crime scene 3 days ago in what’s being dubbed thedeadliest mass shootingon U. S. soil. Sixty-four-year-old Stephen Paddock holed himself up in a casino hotel room with 10 guns, where he shot down on concert goers below, massacring 58 and wounding 527 others. Frustratingly, there seems to be more questions than answers at this point involving the shooter’s motive. But now the narrative of the case has been blown wide open after a man who was staying next door to the shooterat theMandalay Bay is coming forward with the disturbing thing that he witnessed while the massacre was being carried out by supposedly one single shooter.
When frantic calls began to pour into 9/11 that night with news of an active shooting taking place at the concert near the hotel, initial eye witnesses claimed that there were multiple shooters firing down upon the crowd. But for some reason, the mainstream media keeps pushing the narrative that there was only one shooter involved, even though mounting evidence is starting to indicate otherwise.
Australian manBrian Hodge was staying in the room next toPaddock that fateful night, and what he witnessed is destroying the mainstream media’s narrative that the massacre involved only one shooter.After hearing gun fire coming from his floor,Hodge rushed outside and hid in the bushes and called for help. Hodge then said something shocking, certain that this massacre was not carried out byStephen Paddock alone.
“There were multiple people dead and multiple shooters.I was just hiding waiting for police to come get us.We were hiding in the bushes outside waiting for the police.”
Adding, “It was a machine gun from the room next to me. My floor is a crime scene. They killed a security guard on my floor.”
Hodge isn’t the only person who believes there was more than one shooter that carried out the massacre. Many people are feeling uneasy about the official story that’s being pushed, andare starting to suspect there’s something extremely fishy with the narrative the mainstream media is telling everyone.
Why would an accountant, with no criminal history, who according to his own family, didn’t even like guns, suddenly decide to commit the worst mass-casualty shooting in United States history? EvenRepublican Congressman Trey Gowdy is scoffing at the narrative that this was carried out by a lone shooter.
An unproven theory currently being circulated by someone claiming to be an FBI agent is downright chilling, and supports the theory that there was in fact more than one shooter. In an email that was supposedly sent by an FBI agent seeking to remain anonymous, the text reveals a conspiracy of Benghazi-level proportions. The shooter was actually a FBI agent who was involved in a gun running scheme similar to what happened in Libya. But things unfortunately didn’t go as planned. A screenshot of the email is below, whose text reads:
“The LVMPD knows the motive behind the attack, but the FBI will not allow us to release the motive because it implicates the FBI in illegal arms deals and supplying arms to ISIS terrorists within U. S. borders.”
“Stephen Paddock was an undercover FBI agent who participated in multiple illegal arms deals in the Las Vegas area in a gun running entrapment scheme similar to Fast and Furious. Paddock thought he was engaging in another routine arms transfer, but ISIS operatives who were going to meet him learned about the entrapment scheme and Paddock’s true identity. They killed him and carried out the massacre, and then fled the scene.”
The email concluded that people within the police department are “disgusted” and are “pushing for this information to be released to the public.”
While this email cannot be confirmed as being written by an actual FBI agent at this time, this theory makes perfect sense. It’s entirely possible that this was a gun-running scheme gone wrong, and once ISIS realized they were being set up, they decided to retaliate. Remember that ISIS immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, although they wouldn’t provide any proof as to why.
After months of targeting Las Vegas,perhaps ISIS had the opportunity to finally carry out an attack after being double-crossed by an FBI agent.Back in May, ISIS released a 44-minute-long video of the strip in Las Vegas, calling on their supporters to carry out attacks on this area.
“The 44-minute-long video released in May showed footage of the Las Vegas strip from 2015, calling on its supporters to conduct attacks with knives and vehicles, everyday weapons that its supporters have already used many times in the West over the past several years,”Newsweekreported. “The footage also showed New York City and Washington, D. C.”
What do you all think? Was there more than one shooter? Was this massacre retaliation of a gun-running scheme meant to entrap ISIS that went horribly wrong? We need to keep demanding answers, because it’s becoming apparent that the mainstream media is pushing an agenda, and we all know that the media’sagenda is never to report the truth, or for thebenefit of the American people.",1
"She did, an infant in one hand, a toddler gripping the other. Miraculously, all of her children made it to Bangladesh. But her husband, who had been tilling the fields when the soldiers came, was missing. As she ran, she saw a child facedown in a rice paddy. The last Ms. Setara saw of her village was an orange glow burning from the area where her house had been.
“If the color of the fire was in a dress it would be beautiful,” she said, looking down at her muddy clothes, “but it made me very fearful when I saw it.”
A Human Rights Watch investigation documented that parts of Taung Pyo were still burning in mid-September as Myanmar soldiers patrolled the village, despite the fact that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said that all “clearance operations” against militants had ceased on Sept. 5.
While Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as a political prisoner in 1991, controls the country’s civilian government, she has no authority over Myanmar’s military.
Refugees from Taung Pyo, known in the Rohingya dialect as Tumbru, said that there were almost no Rohingya left in the community — they had either bolted to Bangladesh, been killed by gunfire or been arrested. Another villager, Mohamed Aktar, said he counted at least three bodies as he fled the area in late August.
“Maybe more,” he said. “I ran so fast I could not count well.”
Bangladesh has accused Myanmar’s military of laying land mines in the area. One woman who tried to cross back to Taung Pyo, in order to investigate the damage to her home, stepped on a mine and lost most of her leg. She was treated in a hospital in Bangladesh.
The Myanmar military said that any land mines found in the area were the work of Rohingya insurgents. The state news media, meanwhile, have focused on the plight of ethnic Rakhine who had fled their homes and took refuge in a police post near Taung Pyo.
The vast majority of residents in northern Maungdaw township, which includes Taung Pyo, are Rohingya Muslims. But the civil servants there — teachers, nurses, administrators — tend to be ethnic Rakhine Buddhists.
Stories in the local news media focused on how rice, beans and cooking oil had been delivered to Rakhine Buddhists sheltering in Taung Pyo. The stranded community was eventually airlifted to safety.
By contrast, for weeks, international aid groups were unable to deliver aid to Rohingya isolated in Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung townships, the three worst-affected areas. Some Rohingya said by cellphone earlier this week that they still had not gotten adequate food supplies.
The local news media published photographs of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi on Thursday meeting Rohingya in another village in Maungdaw. Before her sat rows of men wearing pristine white prayer caps.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly said that the international community should try to understand why some Rohingya have decided to stay in Rakhine, rather than flee to Bangladesh.
“I hope everything will go fine as local villagers handle the rebuilding process,” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi told the residents of Pan Taw Pyin village. “We all have to try our best to live peacefully.”
But critics say that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, in the most charitable interpretation of her actions, has allowed herself to be blinded to the realities of ethnic cleansing in Rakhine.
“Just as important as finally visiting affected areas is the need for Aung San Suu Kyi to actually understand what happened there. And that requires her to break the military cordon around the information she’s receiving and start listening to other sources,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch.
“Some scales need to fall from her eyes about northern Rakhine State, and one hopes that this could be the beginning of that process,” he said.
So far, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s governing party, the National League for Democracy, has not sent any investigators to the refugee camps in Bangladesh to hear the stories of the more than 600,000 Rohingya who have fled.
The Myanmar government has said it is willing to repatriate those Rohingya who have flocked to Bangladesh over the past two months, if they can prove they used to live in Rakhine.
But many Rohingya escaped their burning villages without any documents, so it is not clear how they will be able to prove their former residency. Most Rohingya have been stripped of their citizenship by the Myanmar government, making them stateless.
On Tuesday, U Zaw Htay, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s spokesman, reiterated that Myanmar was ready to start repatriation immediately, but then accused Bangladesh of dragging its feet in order to wheedle money out of a sympathetic international community.
“I think the reason Bangladesh doesn’t want to send refugees back to Myanmar might be because they announced that they would build the world’s biggest refugee camp,” he said. “That’s why they don’t want to send refugees back to Myanmar, because they are afraid they will lose international donations.”

According to testimony from an executive with 21st Century Fox, a contract for the fallen King of Cable News contained a helpful provision stating that he “could not be dismissed on the basis of an allegation unless that allegation was proved in court.” The revelation stems from a proceeding of Britain’s Competition & Markets Authority (CMA), which is reviewing a bid by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox to assert control of the portion of satellite TV outlet Sky that it doesn’t already own. As part of the review,Jacques Nasser, a director of 21st Century Fox, gave testimony on the company’s inner workings. And what astonishing workings: As Nasser told the story, there was a quick reaction to the accusations against former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, who was sued by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson in July 2016. After a review of Ailes’s conduct, he was quickly ousted. Such a lightning response, however, wasn’t possible in the case of O’Reilly, Nasser told CMA, because of O’Reilly’s contract. Requiring sexual-harassment allegations to be proved in a court of law before dismissing the accused party — that’s a steep requirement. Analyses have shown that well above 90 percent of all civil cases are settled or dismissed before they reach a trial. Not only that, but a wealthy man like O’Reilly can use his assets to ensurethat he’d never face a proven claim of sexual harassment. “He would never let a claim go to trial where he would even have the slightest chance of losing,” says Lisa Banks, a partner at the employment law firm Katz, Marshall & Banks.    Bill O'Reilly, longtime host of Fox News's top-rated show, ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" was fired from the network in April 2017. His departure came after six women alleged he sexually harassed them. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)    The anomalous employment history of O’Reilly at Fox News provides powerful context for what Nasser revealed. As the New York Times reported in April, there were at least five settlements involving O’Reilly’s treatment of women, and several of them were negotiated directly between O’Reilly and the accuser. Those revelations triggered calls for action against O’Reilly advertisers, and the pressure forced Fox News to fire O’Reilly. The story stood right there for months, until the New York Times revealed last month that O’Reilly had in January agreed to another, astounding settlement with legal analyst Lis Wiehl for the sum of $32 million. Though O’Reilly’s bosses were aware of the Wiehl accusation, they were kept in the dark about the settlement amount. They re-upped with the newsman anyhow, in a four-year deal that paid him $25 million per year. In response to that story, 21st Century Fox issued a statement saying, in part, “His new contract, which was made at a time typical for renewals of multi-year talent contracts, added protections for the company specifically aimed at harassment, including that Mr. O’Reilly could be dismissed if the company was made aware of other allegations or if additional relevant information was obtained in a company investigation.” In his remarks to the CMA, Nasser confirmed that “a clause was inserted to state that he could be dismissed on the grounds of an allegation against him without it having to be proved in court,” according to the summary provided by the CMA. From the looks of things, the contract that contained the court-proof provision was negotiated between Team O’Reilly and Fox News; the 2017 version was negotiated with greater input from 21st Century Fox.  That O’Reilly ever had a prove-it-in-court provision says a great deal about: 1) His lawyers, who knew how to protect him; 2) Fox News, which should have seen the provision as fair warning and a potential legal liability: “Fox lawyers and executives knew that this was a big issue if they were signing a contract with him with this type of provision,” says Banks; 3) The ways in which the legal system accommodates rich people; as premier thinker Tom Scocca wrote, settlements are a “Get Out of Jail Free” card for accused sexual harassers such as O’Reilly. And to think: O’Reilly has bashed this very system for unduly empowering complainants to bring frivolous complaints against celebrities. And 4) the malignant Fox News culture of ratings. With very few scoops and little in the way of journalistic integrity, Fox News has always fended off the attacks of critics by pointing to its preeminence in the ratings. As the Fox News sexual-harassment saga drags on, we learn more and more about how low its executives will stoop in order to preserve this distinction. Recent investigations have shown that sexual harassment is a media-wide phenomenon. The New Republic, NPR and ABC News are among the outlets where sexual harassment has taken place. Fox News stands apart, however, for the institutional sanction accorded to the creepy office pursuit of innocent and hard-working women.",0
"PROCTOR — This town, population 1,741, briefly gained Internet notoriety this week from an online news story about a local pastor sentenced to a year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples.
In an alternate universe, that pastor might be serving his sentence.
In the real Proctor, none of this is true and most people haven’t even heard of such a tale.
The article — titled “Christian Pastor in Vermont Sentenced to One Year in Prison After Refusing To Marry Gay Couple” — appeared on a website built to look very similar to NBC News, down to the web address, www.nbc. com.co.
The story claimed Proctor pastor Paul Horner was sentenced to a year in federal prison “after refusing to marry gay couples.” The article further quoted the “Honorable” Myron Danus as imposing the sentence, Steve Shand as head of the “Vermont Family Research Committee” and Gwen Hawkins as president of the “LGBT Pride Center” in Vermont.
The major issue with the story? Horner, Danus, Shand and Hawkins don’t exist — at least not as a Proctor pastor, a Vermont judge and the heads of organizations with opposing views of gay rights.
That didn’t stop the story from being picked up and spread across the Internet, even gaining attention from Fox News journalist Shannon Bream, who tweeted a link to the nbc.com.co story along with a statement she was working to confirm the story.
About 20 minutes later, Bream tweeted: “Our research crew finding nothing legit on VT “story” — why we always Q/seek our own confirmation. Fri night can resume being boring.”
Several calls from Christian news organizations, including the Trumpet Online, came into the Rutland Herald newsroom inquiring if the there was any truth to the story.
But with a simple Google search and a few phone calls, the story crumbled to pieces.
“No, it isn’t true,” said the Rev. Eric VanLeeuwen, pastor of St. Paul’s Lutheran Church on Gibbs Street in Proctor.
He said he received a call from a pastor in California inquiring about the article, but otherwise hasn’t heard from anyone in the community.
“To the best of my knowledge, nobody in Proctor is aware of such a thing,” VanLeeuwen said. “No one in this community has spoken to me about it. I have reason to doubt that this community has much knowledge about it.”
At the town offices, Town Manager Stan Wilbur hadn’t heard a word about it.
According to snopes.com, a website that debunks urban legends, “If the name ‘Paul Horner’ sounds familiar, that’s likely because the moniker is a staple of fake news articles penned by writer Paul Horner for the fake news sites such as the National Report and the News Examiner.”
Horner’s attorney and the sentencing judge are not on the Vermont Judiciary Committee’s list — meaning they are either fictitious or not in good standing.
At the Pride Center of Vermont, Executive Director Kim Fountain has been fielding a few calls and emails asking about the woman named Gwen Hawkins, identified as the president of the LGBT Pride Center in Vermont.
“It’s pure fabrication for the purpose of propaganda,” Fountain said. “I don’t think she actually exists … that organization doesn’t exist to my knowledge. I’ve been here for four years and I’ve never heard of her. Might she exist somewhere in a house? Maybe, but I don’t think so.”
While it seems the tall tale has drawn little attention locally, it made The Washington Post’s list of “What was fake on the Internet this week.”",1
"Kathy Griffin’s appearance at the Uptown Theatre in Napa, California has reportedly been canceled.
“Kathy Griffin’s offensive against Donald Trump Friday apparently fell on deaf ears because the only remaining venue that would allow her to perform has just pulled the plug,” reports TMZ.
The “offensive” in question was Griffin’s press conference earlier this afternoon during which she accused President Donald Trump and his family of bullying her, stating the backlash to her now-infamous ‘beheading’ photo was “definitely a woman thing”.
Griffin also broke down in tears during the conference, stating, “I don’t think I will have a career after this. I think he. I think he. I’m gonna be honest. He broke me. He broke me.”

According to TMZ, prior to that press conference, the Bergen Performing Arts Center in New Jersey cancelled Griffin’s performance there.
A statement on the organization’s Facebook page reports that the decision was made “after very careful consideration.”
Uptown Theatre, meanwhile, appears to have made the decision after the conference.
Many have responded to Uptown Theatre’s statement with praise.
Others, however, appear concerned about alleged infringements on Kathy Griffin’s right to free speech.
Kathy Griffin apparently has yet to respond publicly to news of the cancelation, which follows quite the disastrous week for Griffin, who also lost her gigs co-hosting CNN’s New Year’s Eve special and being a celebrity spokeswoman for Squatty Potty.",1

"(Before It's News)The recent uproar about seats on a British Airways flight crawling with bedbugs is only one of the unintended consequences that urbanization worldwide has on evolution, say Marc Johnson, an associate professor of biology at the University of Toronto Mississauga, and Jason Munshi-South, who is an associate professor of biological sciences at Fordham University.
“As we build cities, we have little understanding of how they are influencing organisms that live there,” says Johnson, who is also director of the University of Toronto’s Centre for Urban Environments (@CUE_UofT). “It’s good news that some organisms are able to adapt, such as native species that have important ecological functions in the environment. But it can also be bad news that the ability of some of these organisms to adapt to our cities might increase the transmission of disease. Bedbugs, for example, were scarce two decades ago, but they’ve adapted to the insecticides used to keep them at bay and have exploded in abundance worldwide.”

In the first study to take a comprehensive look at the way urbanization is affecting evolution, Johnson and Munshi-South reviewed all existing research studies about urbanization and evolution and synthesized the results.
“Traditionally, we’ve thought about evolution as a long-term process driven by environmental pressures and the interactions between species. But now there is a new driver that is rapidly changing many other species, which is how they interact with humans and our built environment”, says Munshi-South. “Humans and our cities are one of the most dominant forces of contemporary evolution now.”
The study raises questions about which native species can persist during urbanization and whether those that adapt will influence the health of ecosystems and human beings. Loss of habitat and urban barriers (roads, buildings, etc.) pose challenges to all kinds of species and some may adapt in undesirable ways. The researchers assessed various means of genetic adaptation, such as mutation, the movement of genes through dispersal, neutral evolution and adaptive evolution through Darwinian natural selection, concluding that the urban environment has an impact on each of these mechanisms of evolution.
Their work touches on mammals, plants, birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects and viruses, identifying evolutionary impacts on species as diverse as the common blackbird in Europe to white clovers and white-footed mice in North America. Populations of white-footed mice in New York City, for example, became differentiated from each other after urbanization, due to their isolation in various parks.
“We’ve created a novel ecosystem that no organism has ever seen before,” said Johnson, noting that their study, published Nov. 3 in the journal, Science, is a “wake-up call for the public, governments and other scientists.”
He and Munshi-South suggest that we need to think carefully about how we’re altering our environment in unintended ways when we build cities, influencing the evolution of species that may, in turn, influence our lives. A number of organisms, such as rats, urban lizards, cockroaches, pigeons and bedbugs, have evolved to depend on humans.
There are now mosquitoes, for example, that have evolved to live in the London Underground stations and adapted so that they no longer need to feed on blood to produce eggs. They also have no need to become dormant during the winter. Unfortunately, these mosquitoes can carry a number of diseases and are now found in New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles, too. Our healthcare systems may be required to adapt in response.
Johnson and Munshi-South suggest that when we’re planning cities, we need to think about the impact our designs have on native species and whether we can design them to “be kinder to ourselves and the environment,” considering ways to conserve native species and mitigate the prevalence of disease-carrying pests.
Given that species are evolving so rapidly in response to urbanization, the outdoors also becomes a classroom that offers an opportunity to see examples of evolution firsthand. Urban evolution can be used as a tool to educate city dwellers and others about the reality and importance of evolutionary biology.
“People who don’t believe in evolution need not go further than their backyards to see evidence of it,” Johnson said.
The study was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.",1
"Outgoing Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has signed on with Fox News as a contributor, effective one day after he resigns from Congress this week.
Chaffetz, former chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee who oversaw the investigations into the IRS targeting of conservative nonprofit groups and the death of a U. S. ambassador in Benghazi, Libya, will offer political analysis on Fox News Channel and Fox News Business Network's daytime and primetime programs, according to a release from the network. Chaffetz, who in May announced he was leaving Congress to spend more time with his wife and family, officially resigns from Congress Friday, and starts his role with Fox Saturday. Chaffetz already makes frequent appearances on the network.
The 50-year-old Chaffetz had left the possibility of a contract with Fox open to speculation, and his decision not to finish his current term fueled speculation about the reasons behind his abrupt departure.
""For those that would speculate otherwise, let me be clear that I have no ulterior motives,"" he said in Facebook post first announcing his decision not to seek re-election. ""I am healthy. I am confident I would continue to be re-elected by large margins.""
Some viewed Mr. Chaffetz' position as chairman of the oversight panel as a difficult one, with the Trump administration in power. The role of Chaffetz' committee is to ferret out waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, and as concerns over Russia and President Trump's vast business ties loom, the committee's ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland) and other Democrats have called on him to probe the administration more aggressively.
Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-South Carolina) was selected to take Chaffetz' place as oversight chairman.
Chaffetz told The Hill in an interview published this week that he thinks members of Congress -- many of whom sleep in their offices -- should receive a $2,500 monthly stipend for housing in D. C., one of the most expensive housing markets in the country.",0
"TheBlaze’s Dana Loesch recently filmed a video for the National Rifle Associationwhere she called out the New York Times for their agenda-driven media coverage:
We the people have had it with your narratives, your propaganda, your fake news.
We’ve had it with your constant protection of your Democrat overlords, your refusal to acknowledge any truth that upsets the fragile construct that you believe is real life.
And we’ve had it with your pretentious tone-deaf assertion that you are, in any way, are truth or fact-based journalism.
Consider this the shot across your proverbial bow.
We’re going to fisk the New York Times and just what deep, rich means to this old gray hag, this untrustworthy, dishonest rag that has subsisted on the welfare of mediocrity for one, two, three more decades.
We’re going to laser focus on your so-called honest pursuit of truth. In short, we’re coming for you.
Liberals, including CNN military analyst Mark Hertling, had a meltdown over the NRA ad, saying Loesch’s message is “hateful” and “encourages violence. “
Hertling was so upset by Loesch’s ad that he decided to report Loesch to the federal government.
This is the 5th ""ad"" from @NRATV & they are increasingly shocking and hateful, threatening Americans and institutions. I've reported them. https://t.co/qy0dcMLrti
A Twitter user agreed with Hertling, saying to not bother responding to people like Loesch.
Be vigilant, yes. But let's not call them out too much. Doing so only gives credence to their vileness.
Ironically, Hertling said it’s important for people to call out their leaders for wrongdoing, which is what Loesch did in her ad.
I don't agree. A leader holds people to standards and has moral courage to call out those who violate them. Otherwise you lose liberty.
Yes, please report me to the government for threatening to fact check media. That isn't censorship at all. 
Lol, sounds like #tattletale Hertling needs to find his safe space.  @CNN #fakenews feelings seem to be hertling a little bit.
When did we become a country that reports people to the recess monitor for threatening to expose the truth of the bully on the playground?
You've done a great job drawing these mental derelicts out into the open! Now that they're exposed, how can we exploit their stupidity?

"Reacting to an ABC News investigation into theft by Transportation Security Administration officers, Senator Charles Schumer (D-New York) today called on the agency to do random sting operations on its employees ""to test whether TSA agents are acting in a trustworthy manner to protect passenger property.""
Schumer's request came in a letter to TSA head John Pistole and also proposed that the TSA randomly screen its employees at the end of the work day.
""Most TSA agents are very good, hard-working and conscientious, but there are a few bad apples that spoil the bunch,"" Schumer told ABC News today. ""We have to find them.""
Last week an ABC News investigation revealed that 381 TSA officers have been fired since the TSA was formed a decade ago for allegedly stealing from passengers. As part of the investigation, ABC News tracked an iPad that was purposefully left behind at an airport security checkpoint to the home of a TSA agent who was later fired for the alleged theft.
Another former TSA employee, Pythias Brown, served three years in prison for theft and said he stole approximately $800,000 worth of cash and merchandise from travelers before he was caught.
""It was very commonplace, very,"" Brown told ABC News. ""It was very convenient to steal… [TSA agents] didn't think it was okay, but they did it and said, 'I don't care. They ain't paying me. They're treating me wrong.' But when people started seeing they could profit off of it, then it became massive.""
In response to ABC News' original report, the TSA provided a statement that said it has a ""zero tolerance"" policy towards theft and that the number of officers fired ""represents less than one-half of one percent of officers that have been employed"" by the TSA.
The agency has conducted internal sting operations in the past after allegations of wrongdoing and has caught some officers red-handed, according to court documents.
The TSA Office of Inspection and the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General conducted a joint undercover operation at the Kona International Airport in Hawaii on March 11, 2011 ""in response to numerous allegations that KOA Lead Transportation Security Officer... Dawn Nikole Keka, was suspected of stealing cash from Japanese travelers passing through her security lane,"" a criminal complaint said.
An undercover special agent of Japanese heritage placed 13 $100 U. S. bills in an orange wallet, and then placed the wallet in a Hello Kitty backpack and went through Keka's checkpoint screening.
Immediately upon leaving the checkpoint, the undercover special agent examined the contents of the backpack and discovered she was $200 short, the documents said. Another special agent asked Keka to empty her pockets and she produced two $100 bills. The agents matched the serial numbers of the two bills to ones the undercover special agent had placed in the backpack.
Keka ended up pleading guilty to one count of theft and was sentenced to two months in prison.
Schumer told ABC News that such operations should not just be conducted in response to reported wrongdoing, but randomly to keep all TSA agents honest.
""The TSA has a huge job, but when it comes to the security and safety of people's valuables, which they entrust to the TSA when they put them on the conveyor belt and go through the inspection, [TSA officials] have to be very, very careful and very, very vigilant,"" Schumer said. ""Thus far they haven't done enough and could be doing more.""
In response to Schumer's letter, the TSA told ABC News in a statement that ""ensuring the safety of travelers through a professional workforce is of the highest priority for the TSA.""
""TSA takes allegations of misconduct seriously and will take appropriate corrective action as warranted,"" the statement said.",0

"Sean Hannity is nothing but a legend in the media industry and a very respectful and honorable man. He is so good that he bothers the leftists so everything they do and every action they take has only one purpose – to undermine him and lower his ratings.

"Every time a mass shooting happens we can depend on a few things. First, everyone will offer thoughts and prayers.Oddly those never seem to result in any action. Then, the left will come out and call for better laws and the political right will say that the country needs time to mourn.
We’ve had timemany times overto mourn as a country, and a nationwide discussion about our gun violence epidemic does nothing to devaluethe mourning of families who have lost loved ones to yet another mass shooting. We are becoming so desensitized that most mass shootings—four or more people killed or injured —don’t even make the national news anymore.
More: Las Vegas shooting: The gun fight is over and the gun-rights crowd won
It’s not too early to talk about gun violence, it’s too late. Too late for the 59 families who lost a loved one and 527 folks who were wounded in Las Vegas. Too late for the 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook. The list goes on.
Republicans ostensibly believe in personal responsibility above all else. Itseems absurd to me that conservatives consider access to firearms a right but access to health insurance merely a privilege. I believe that the majority of Americans, from both the left and the right, can agree on a few first steps on guns, and then a pause to gauge effectiveness.
First, we need a five-year recurring cycle of background checks and training. That may sound like a lot to those used to being able to purchase a gun and never have to think about training or background checks again, but it’s similar to what the military requires. During my 12 years of service, one of my responsibilities in the Navy was to train sailors in the use of force, and both lethal and non-lethal weapons and tactics. Before anyone was even allowed to get into boot camp, let alone in a room with firearms, they had to pass a background check. After that, they still had to undergo hours of training before being allowed to shoot.
Each year, they had to fire the weapons on which they were qualified and sit through hours of training in tactical team movement, rules of engagement and measures — all with the simple goal of keeping everyone safe. Every five years, the background check process began again. If it’s good enough for the military (one might say“a well-regulated militia”) it should be good enough for Americans who tout the SecondAmendment as divine.
We’ll also need a cap on the capacity of magazines. Now, that may sound scary or less fun to gun enthusiasts, but watch video from Las Vegasand note that the shooter fired continuously through each magazine before taking a significant amount of time to reload. Imagine how many people would still be alive today if he was only able to fire 10 rounds at a time rather than 30, 50, 100 or more. We also need to outright banbump stocksand other technically legal modifications that allow semi-automatic weapons to be used as automatic weapons. This should be easy.
This issue cannot be solved state by state so it absolutely must come in the form of national legislation. California has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation but Nevada, where the shooting on Sunday occurred, has some of the most lax. The states share a border and there aren’t exactly a ton of checkpoints.
This should not be a partisan issue. More than 90% of Americans say universal background checks are a good first step. In fact, 72% of NRA members agree.
Surely we cannot end all gun violence and surely there will be those that say these laws won’t work because criminals violate laws and they’ll just buy what they want on the black market. I challenge them to pull up Yelp and find the location of the black market. I challenge them with the data that our gun violence and death rate is dramatically higher than in nations with strict gun laws.
More: How do we prevent future Stephen Paddocks? After Vegas, way forward fraught with problems.
Some will also say that there are already so many guns and high capacity magazines out there that this won’t make a difference. To that, I say that’s true for 2017. Every year that passes it becomes less true. Imagine if we had taken action after Columbinein 1999 (15 dead, 24 injured), Virginia Techin 2007 (32 dead, 17 injured), Sandy Hook in 2012 (26 dead, 2 injured), or even as recently as the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando last year (49 dead, 58injured).
It’s past time to talk about smart, principled national policy that respects the SecondAmendment and the lives of American citizens and our guests. Republicans must find the courage toend their love affair with gun manufacturers and the NRA.

"For a long time, various names have been floated as replacements for President Donald Trump’s White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who has appeared to suffer under the strain of dealing with the hostile and deeply disrespectful liberal press.
One of the people whose name rose to the top of the list was Fox News host Kimberly Guifoyle, who has established a good rapport with President Trump over the past few months. However, Kimberly just received news that she would not, in fact, be able to join the White House communications team.
Seeing as though Kimberly is such a hot commodity, it is not surprising that the executives at Fox News decided to pounce and just signed Guilfoyle to a lucrative, multi-year broadcast contract with the network. As part of her deal, she will continue to serve as one of the hosts of the popular programThe Five.
Said Guilfoyle after signing her new contract,“I’m excited to remain at Fox News Channel, a place I have called home for many years, and to continue my role as co-host ofThe Five.I very much look forward to what lies ahead.”
Guilfoyle has been a co-host onThe Fivesince 2006, and has won a large and dedicated fan base for her work. Commented Fox News’ president of programming Suzanne Scott, “Throughout the past decade, Kimberly has served as a popular commentator here at Fox News. She’s a huge asset toThe Five.” Are you happy that Kimberly was rewarded with a huge contract and will stay at Fox News?",1

"Plasma regularly escapes from the sun through eruptions on our star’s surface. Thankfully, the Earth is protected from these high energy particles due to the planet’s magnetic field – but they can result in potentially catastrophic ‘space hurricanes’.
Even the smallest of particles exploding off the sun can have a huge impact in the development of so-called space hurricanes, due to a phenomenon known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability.
It means a dense radiation zone, known as the Van Allen belts, created by solar wind particles, effectively lays siege to the Earth.
While the charged materials are unable to reach into Earth’s atmosphere, turbulence brewing outside could potentially impact humankind in other ways.
Anomalies known as ‘space hurricanes’ have the potential to knock out communications and even impede manned space missions. Just like on Earth, the hurricanes formed by the accumulation of heat energy can have devastating impacts.
Researchers from the US, UK and Finland studying the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability found that the phenomenon, whereby materials with different velocities pass one another, can trigger such vortices.
Like ripples created by wind passing over water, instability caused by the sun’s plasma bouncing off Earth’s magnetic field has the potential to grow and form bands of heat energy approximately 67,000km (42,000 miles) above the Earth’s surface.
Lead author of a new study on the phenomenon, Katariina Nykyri, from the Center for Space and Atmospheric Research in Florida, compared the distribution of plasma via the Kelvin Helmholtz phenomenon to the “butterfly effect” – the theory that a small change can have large consequences further afield.
“It’s a nice analogy… when you have a plasma butterfly in the magnetosheath flapping its wings in the right frequency and in the right amplitude, you can create larger Kelvin-Helmholtz waves and larger space hurricanes,”she told RT.com.
As part of the study, the team analyzed seven years of NASA Themis spacecraft data regarding magnetosheath velocity changes.
Nykyria said observing fluctuations in space weather is essential for the protection of critical infrastructure, like communication satellites, floating around in the great expanse.
“These Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, they can actually excite and produce these ultra frequency fluctuations on the Earth’s magnetic field lines that can interact with radiation belt particles. And that’s where the danger comes in.
“When you have a charged particle that is accelerating or deaccelerating it actually produces radiation and this kind of radiation is extremely harmful for astronauts but also for the instrumentation and any kind of technology onboard spacecraft,”she said.
The full study, which also included research from universities in Exeter, Alaska and Espoo, Finland, is available in theJournal of GeophysicalResearch.

"Yes, at first this AI could seem quite harmless, but there are predictions that once the AI starts to study the earth and its inhabitants, this could all change. Even if the AI still seems harmless, it could become too intelligent for humans to understand well and that could lead to problems or a threat as the AI decides to take over. It could happen if the AI believed itself superior to those around it.
Can A Human Hive Take on Alien Intelligence?
So, what can the human race do, are they doomed to domination? Not, necessarily, turns out the answer to dealing with the AI perhaps on it’s terms lies in the human brain. The human brain is a vast computer in itself, in many ways, there are aspects to it that many of us haven’t even harnessed within ourselves. So, imagine if many were to come together as in a sort of human hive of brains? It turns out there is research being conducted where the human mind becomes a sort of hive mind working on one purpose.
Think along the lines of saying the bee, one bee alone isn’t much of a threat or even that cunning but a whole hive working together, is quite powerful. So, in these studies, humans have come together and created a human brain hive. One such study was conducted using sports fans who were brought together in a group to see if they could accurately predict the outcome of the English Premier League games. The study was conducted by the Unanimous AI and Oxford University. The result of the study of forming a human hive was that these individuals when united as one was able to be around 72% accurate on their predictions. This was better than the fact that individuals it was only around 55%.
This is just one study that proves that together humans can create an amazing vast computer hive of intelligence. But the question remains will that be enough? Well, if history has proven anything it’s never to underestimate the self-preservation of human beings, we have determination, desire and we also understand about emotions such as love.
So, maybe the intelligence level may not get to the same extreme even a human hive as the Alien Intelligence, but these other components could end up being the secret weapon of the human race. So, even in a human brain hive, it’s important that humans never lose track of the thing that could set them apart from any form of AI their humanity.",1
"Will Snopes be weighing in on this one? Or are they too busy undermining Conservatives?
As someone who works for NBC, you’d think she’d be better at being skeptical. Her ‘journalistic’ instincts are WAY off.
The same person who uncritically retweeted a completely bogus Trump-bashing tweet because it affirmed her biases once went on record publicly doubting a wheel-chair-bound man’s SUPPOSED DISABILITY.
Shockingly… that confirmed the SAME political biases.
Maybe we’ll later learn she has inside evidence about FDR’s supposed disability, too.
But this ‘journalist’ who is so VERY objective that she takes NOTHING at face value retweeted this:
A short clip that sums up this G7 summit: look who has chosen not to hear a translation of his Italian host's speech #G6 pic.twitter.com/6pXbBlfvof
In it, the video pans across leaders, where most of them are wearing headphones that are very prominently visible. No headphones are visible on Trump in that particular clip. So, rushing ahead blindly — just like they did with the MLK Bust story… she took it as gospel.
Not content to merely PASS ALONG a bogus story, she needed to editorialize it, too. It’s what passes for ‘professional and impartial’ in the networks these days.
If you weren’t sure why we call the Media (D) ‘Presstitutes’… this should clear that up for you.
As usual @POTUS wears a single ear piece for translation in his right ear https://t.co/Opm2qk1hOQ
The guy whose clip she retweeted issued a correction.
There used to be a time where journalists were expected to tell a STORY, and to be APOLITICAL — not build a pro-Democrat/Anti-conservative narrative.
But she, like the rest of the Media (D) works as a Presstitute. Which means never having to say you’re sorry.
Build the narrative. Throw some darts — context and evidence be damned — and move on before your audience has time to realize they’ve been fed a spoonful of crap.
Back in February, we began a list of some of the bogus stories the Media has been shoveling our way.
KEEPING SCORE: Here Are SIXTEEN ‘Fake News’ Stories … Published SINCE The Election Obviously, that list is longer now. But it’s good to remind ourselves of the times they’ve been caught pushing lies before. It helps put BS like this in proper perspective.
And here’s one about the supposed Fact-Checkers themselves… plus a handy little tool for making the bogus news narrative backfire on the Leftists.
It’s a good gig if you don’t have to look at yourself in the mirror.
Of course, if the day comes that people realize you’ve been shoveling sh-t all along, you’ll have to go out and get real work. Good luck with that.

"A brave TV news anchor continued delivering a breaking news story about a fatal car crash, while aware that her own spouse was likely the victim in her live report.
Supreet Kaur, 28, finished delivering her morning bulletin after another ten minutes before breaking down in grief.
Mrs Kaur was presenting her usual 10am Saturday bulletin for Indian station IBC24 in Chhattisgarh, when news broke of a crash in Mahasamund.
A reporter on the scene told the news presenter three people had died, but did not give names.
But gradually, as he read out more details, including the make of car and the location, it became apparent to Mrs Kaur that her husband had been travelling in the vehicle involved.
Show producers also realised their host was hearing news of her husband’s death in front of the cameras, but were unable to stop the live bulletin.
But in a scarcely believable show of courage and professionalism, Mrs Kaur continued calmly speaking to the reporter on the phone until the segment was complete.
It was only after the cameras stopped rolling that the news presenter let her facade slip, breaking down in tears and calling relatives.
An IBC24 editor told Indian Express: “It speaks volumes about her sense of duty and professionalism that she continued and kept her calm for another 10 minutes.
“The moment the cameras were off she began calling her relatives and broke down. She left for the accident site after that.
“Kaur has worked with us for nine years and is one of the most popular anchors in the state. We stand with our colleague in her pain.’’
A police officer said three people were killed when a Renault Duster was struck from behind by another vehicle, believed to be a truck.
Mrs Kaur’s husband, Harshad Kawade, was among the dead. The two other passengers were badly injured and taken to hospital.
Footage of the broadcast has gone viral, with the brave news presenter being showered in praise for her professionalism.
Dr Raman Singh tweeted: “Salute Supreet’s strength in dealing with her husbands demise with extraordinary bravery and professionalism. May departed soul rest in peace.”
Others called her a “braveheart” and a “woman of steel”.",1

"Scientists working on the cleanup operation at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan have revealed that most of the world’s oceans are now completely uninhabitable.
Since the nuclear meltdown, mainstream media and government’s around the world have colluded to completely downplay the impact of the disaster.
Despite reports claiming that humans may never consume fish from the ocean again due to radiation poisoning, the mainstream media has continued to lie by claiming that the cleanup operation has been a “complete success.”
TEPCO is the company responsible for monitoring and conveying the vital stats from the meltdown. They’ve not been shy in conceding that nuclear radiation is in fact, leaking into the ocean, but they are massively downplaying its severity. Around 300 to 450 tons of nuclear-contaminated materials is leaking from Fukushima on a daily basis.
Prepforthat.com reports: Remember, it was only a month ago thatTEPCO was stating it would be dumping all the radioactive material into our oceans.
Some of this ‘coverup’ is being played out by debates over science (imagine that). A scientist namedKen Buesseler claims that the radiation levels currently found in fish may not be at levels toxic to humans. But many scientists say there isn’t such a thing as “safe levels” of radioactive material consumption. Additionally, realize that Beusseler says “may not be toxic.” How many people are willing to roll the dice of health?
According toeconewsmedia.com, the contaminated water contains traces of radioactive iodine, cesium, and strontium-89 and 90.
The situation is entirely too catastrophic in magnitude for humans to control it. Fishing industries in the region have been toppled by contamination reports ran on fish. And now there are even studies providing evidence that fish off the coast of the United States and Canada are adversely affected.
What’s likely most important, as things stand, is if this is largely turning into a coverup of epic proportions. Concealing the reality of this situation would be a global crime against humanity. Our oceans are one of our lifebloods, we need to understandhow compromised they may or may not be.
A recent robot probe captured what appears to be fall out from the 2011 meltdown. The image reveals what many believe to be melted nuclear fuel that deposited itself as a cover on the ocean floor.
Fukushima Radiation Levels Are “Astronomical” According To Washington Post
Back in February of 2011, the Washington Postreportedthat radiation levels being released were “astronomical.” TEPCO claimed the levels were at530 sieverts per hour. Even a minuscule amount of exposure to this level of radiation could kill a human. We are also talking about infertility and hair loss and cancer. These recordings were taken from the reactor’s core, however, one must ask, where is this stuff being deposited?
But not to worry, the same article from the Washington Post cited an expert as saying that the Japanese people shouldn’t be alarmed by this. So truly, nothing to see here, right?
It must be stressed that radiation in this area has not been measured before, and it was expected to be extremely high. While 530 Sv/hr is the highest measured so far at Fukushima Daiichi, it does not mean that levels there are rising, but that a previously unmeasurable high-radiation area has finally been measured. Similar remote investigations are being planned for Daiichi Units 1 and 3. We should not be surprised if even higher radiation levels are found there, but only actual measurements will tell.
The fact is, nuclear reactors are all over countries worldwide, including the United States. Power grid compromises, human error and even acts of terrorism can cause a nuclear reactor to meltdown and inevitably put your life in danger.",1

"The great port-a-potty cover-up of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration has been solved.
As workers prepare for the Jan. 20 inauguration, someone placed blue tape over the name of the company — ""Don's Johns"" — a business which has long supplied portable restrooms for major outdoor events. The tape is blocking out the company's name on dozens of portable restrooms installed near the Capitol for the inauguration.
But after the company's chief operating officer told NBC News on Friday he had no idea who was doing it or why, a spokesman for the Architect of the Capitol, the federal agency that oversees the complex, revealed the reason.
""The AOC is in the process of covering or removing signage on the portable toilets to bring them into compliance with Capitol Grounds restrictions on advertising,"" spokesman Justin Kieffer told NBC News.
While another port-a-potty company's signs have been easily peeled off, ""Don's Johns signs cannot and are being covered with tape,"" Kieffer said, swatting down any theories of a larger conspiracy because of the name.
Virginia-based Don's Johns calls itself the Washington area's top provider of portable toilet rentals.
COO Rob Weghorst said there have been situations where golf tournaments or networks for sporting events have asked that they cover up their signage unless they wanted to pay an advertising fee. He did not immediately respond questions about the Architect of the Capitol's explanation.",0

"A three-headed alien is wandering around Central Park right now. If you believe that, you might be susceptible to a fake news story. Artificial Intelligence technology, however, could be a vital weapon in the war on fake news, according to cybersecurity companies.
Popular during the last election but still prevalent on Facebook and other social media channels, fake news stories make wild claims, tend to exist only on a handful of minor news sites, and can be difficult to verify.
Yet, artificial intelligence could help us all weed out the good from the bad.
Experts tell Fox News that machine learning, natural language processing, semantic identification, and other techniques could at least provide a clue about authenticity.
NEW $27 MILLION FUND AIMS TO SAVE HUMANITY FROM DESTRUCTIVE AI
Catherine Lu, a product manager at fraud detection company DataVisor, says AI could detect the semantic meaning behind a web article. Here’s one example. With the three-headed alien, a natural language processing (or NLP) engine could look at the headline, the subject of the story, the geo-location, and the main body text. An AI could determine if other sites are reporting the same facts. And the AI could weigh the facts against established media sources.
“The New York Times is probably a more reputable of a source than an unknown, poorly designed website,” Lu told Fox News. “A machine learning model can be trained to predict the reputation of a web site, taking into account features such as the Alexa web rank and the domain name (for example, a .com domain is less suspicious than a .web domain).”
Ertunga Arsal, the CEO of German cybersecurity company ESNC, tells Fox News that an AI has an advantage in detecting fake news because of the extremely large data set -- billions of websites all over the world. Also, the purveyors of fake news are fairly predictable.
One example he mentioned is that many of the fake news sites register for a Google AdSense account (using terms like “election”), then start posting the fake news. (Since once of the primary goals is to get people to click and then collect the ad revenue.)
WHITE HOUSE: WE'RE RESEARCHING AI, BUT DON’T WORRY ABOUT KILLER ROBOTS
“An AI could use keyword analytics in discovering and flagging sensational words often used in fake news headlines,” he said, noting that there will only be an increase in the number of fake news stories, similar to the rise of spam, and the time is now to do something about it.
Dr. Pradeep Atrey from the University at Albany has already conducted research on semantic processing to detect the authenticity of news sites. He tells Fox News a similar approach could be used to detect fake news. For example, an algorithm could rate sites based on a “reward and punishment” system. Less popular sites would be rated as less trustworthy.
“There are methods that can be used to at least minimize, if not fully eradicate, fake news instances,” he says. “It depends on how and up to what extent we use such methods in practice.”
Unfortunately, according to Dr. Atrey, many people don’t take the extra step to verify the authenticity of news sites to determine trustworthiness. An AI could identify a site as fake and pop up a warning to proceed with caution, similar to how malware detection works.
Not everyone is on board with using an AI to detect fake news, however.
Paul Shomo, a Senior Technical Manager at security firm Guidance Software, tells Fox News that fake news producers could figure out how to get around the AI algorithms. He says it’s “a little scary” to think an AI might mislabel a real news story as fake (known as a false positive).
Book author Darren Campo, adjunct professor at the NYU Stern School of Business says fake news is primarily about an emotional response. He says people won’t care if an AI has identified news as fake. What they often care about is whether the news matches up with their own worldview.
“Fake news protects itself by embedding a ‘fact’ in terms that can be defended,” he tells Fox News. “While artificial intelligence can identify a fact as incorrect, the AI cannot comprehend the context in which people enjoy believing a lie.”
That’s at least good news for the three-headed alien.",0
"Dan Harris is co-anchor of “Nightline” and the weekend edition of “Good Morning America” on ABC News. He also regularly files reports for “World News Tonight with David Muir,” “20/20,” “Good Morning America,” ABC News Digital and ABC News Radio. Previously, he anchored “World News Sunday.”
In 2014, Harris published the book, 10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress without Losing My Edge and Found Self-Help That Actually Works. It went to #1 on the New York Times Bestsellers List, and then became an app, designed to teach meditation to skeptics, and a podcast, talking with smart people about whether there's anything beyond 10 percent.
Harris first joined ABC News in March 2000 and has covered many of the biggest stories in recent years. He reported on the mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, Aurora, Colorado, and Tucson, Arizorna, and natural disasters from Haiti to Myanmar to New Orleans. He has also covered combat in Afghanistan, Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, and has made six visits to Iraq.
He has traveled around the globe for ABC News, embedding with an isolated Amazonian Indian tribe, questioning drug lords in the lawless slums of Rio, and confronting the head of Philip Morris International over the sale of cigarettes to Indonesian minors. Harris has made it a priority to shine a light on the world’s most vulnerable populations, producing stories about child slaves in Haiti, youths accused of witchcraft in the Congo and predatory pedophiles who travel from the U. S. to Cambodia. He has also covered endangered animals from such diverse datelines as Namibia, Madagascar, Papua New Guinea and Nepal.
Domestically, Harris has led ABC News' coverage of faith, with a particular focus on the evangelical movement. He scored one of the first interviews with former pastor Ted Haggard after his sex and drugs scandal. He has also interviewed Mormon apostles, Roman Catholic cardinals, self-help gurus, and atheists.
In other domestic coverage, Harris has reported on politics, business and criminal justice, including once spending 48 hours locked up in solitary confinement for a story about whether this form of incarceration is inhumane.
Prior to joining ABC News, Harris was an anchor at New England Cable News (NECN), the largest regional cable news network in the country, from 1997 to 2000. Before that, he was an anchor and political reporter at WCSH, an NBC affiliate in Portland, Maine, for two years. He began his broadcasting career as a reporter for WLBZ, the NBC affiliate in Bangor, Maine.
Harris has been honored several times for his journalistic contributions. He received an Edward R. Murrow Award for his reporting on a young Iraqi man who received the help he needed in order to move to America, and in 2009 and 2014 won Emmy Awards for international reporting that aired on “Nightline.” In 2013, he received the ASPCA's Presidential Service Award for Media Excellence.
A graduate of Colby College in Waterville, Maine, Harris also holds honorary doctorate degrees from Colby and Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts. He was raised in Newton, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and currently lives in New York City with his wife, Bianca, and their young son, Alexander, and three cats.",0
"The deadliest mass shooting took place on Sunday night after a deranged psychopath savagely opened fire on a music festival from the32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, killing 59 and injuring 527. Now a disturbing “hit list” has just accidentally leaked of who the killer’s group is targeting next, and it’s vital that we get this info circulated before another massacre takes place.
While the liberal media would love for everyone to believe that the killer was a right-wing gun nut, insidesources within the FBI hostage rescue team that day are nowrevealingthat they found Antifa propaganda littered throughout the hotel room. Since the attack, Antifa members have been all over social media praising the killer and taking credit for the killer’s actions, with liberal news commentators celebrating that “Trump supporters” were massacred during the country music concert.
As the details about the killer’s true intentions are being censored by the mainstream media as leftists relentlessly push their biased agenda, Antifa terrorists are actively plotting another attack on Americans, and have even released a disturbing hit list of conservative Americans that they’re targeting.
Antifa terrorists are setting their sites on conservatives at colleges and universities, where the Berkeley campus has become a favorite place for them to target potential victims. Breaking reports confirm that these terroristic thugs have been stalking and harassing Republican students at theUniversity of California, Berkeley, but unfortunately, these domestic terrorists are not satisfied with just mere threats. Antifa terrorists have now published a list of conservatives they intend to “take out” with a “hit list” that’s now circulating on social media. Conservative Tribune has more:
Thugs affiliated with theterror groupantifa have reportedly been stalking and harassing Republican students from theUniversity of California, Berkeley, even going so far as to post their live locations on social media.
Last Wednesday, for instance,a Twitter account with the alias “Berkeley Antifa” identified several members of the Berkeley College Republicans student group by name and posted their alleged location to Twitter, according toCampus Reform.
“BCR meeting right now inside Eureka at 2068 Center St after drinking with Kyle Chapman and Joey Gibson at Fashy’s, I mean, Pappy’s,” the thugs wrote. “Inside right now is Troy Worden, Ashton Whitty, Naweed Tahmas, Matt Ronnau, Angelie Castenada, and two others.”
Conservative studentAshton Whitty who attendsUC Berkeley went on Fox News to recount the horrifying encounter that left her scared for her life, afterAntifa thugs ambushed her at a gas station and began pummeling her vehicle. “If you didn’t think members of ANTIFA could get any more odious, the Berkeley sect of the domestic terrorist group has been actively stalking Republicans.,” Milo reported.
There’s actual video evidence showing the domestic terrorists attacking her vehicle, that you can view below along with Witty’s interview from Fox News:
“Antifa has taken pictures of me, they’ve followed me on the street, and have tracked my location using social media,” she toldCampus Reform.“It’s rather odd why these people would see us as such a priority when we’re just everyday people.”
The time for scoffing at Antifa, who many disregard as kids playing dress-up from the headquarters of their moms’ basements is over. Thanks to the funding these domestic terrorists are receiving by Obama and Hillary, one of Antifa’s very own members was able to pull off the deadliest mass shooting in United States history.
What’s incredibly chilling is that 5 days before the massacre took place, conservative commentator Steven Crowder released an undercover video of Antifa, after he and another member of his investigation team were able to successfully infiltrate the terror group after 6 months of going undercover with false identities.
Members of the group admitted that the entire premise of the group was to fight “fascists” (Antifa members’ term for conservatives) by whatever means possible, where they’re actively plotting to take people out with violence and are attempting to start a civil war. One Antifa member was secretly recorded handing out knives to other members in order to stab anyone showing up to oppose them.Steven Crowder exposed:
Crowder begins the exposé by explaining that his team of reporters has been “infiltrating this organization for a long time, hard.” The result is evidence that is so damning that the authorities ended up thanking Crowder and his team for their work.
“Are they really an inconsequential group of rabble rousers?” asks Crowder of the group that has been championed by so many on the Left. As the video shows, and as so many around the country have learned over the last year, the answer is a resounding no.
Being that Obama is tied to these radical leftist groups, the fact that an Antifa member successfully pulled off the largest massacre in U. S. history is extremely unsettling. And with a hit list being released by these Antifa terrorists, it’s vital that Americans help spread the news about Antifa’s plans before more innocent Americans perish at their terroristic hands.",1

For years, Roy Halladay stood not only atop the pitcher's mound but atop Major League Baseball, too. Over the course of his career, the pitcher racked up two Cy Young awards and earned All-Star honors eight times. Even after retirement, he also achieved great heights — albeit in a different way, getting his pilot's license and posting often on social media about his beloved new plane.
On Tuesday, that new avocation ended in tragedy. The Pasco County (Fla.) Sheriff's Department confirmed that Halladay's small aircraft crashed in the waters off Florida, killing him at age 40.
""Many know Roy as a Cy Young winner, a future Hall of Famer, one of the best pitchers to ever pitch in the game of baseball. We know Roy as a person, as a caring husband who loved his wife, Brandy, and loved his two boys tremendously,"" Sheriff Chris Nocco said at a news conference Tuesday.
Nocco said Halladay even donated a dog to the sheriff's office to serve as a K-9 officer.
""He was probably one of the most humble human beings you'll ever meet,"" Nocco continued, later adding:. ""You wouldn't know what Roy did because Roy would never tell you what he did. And that's the legacy of a great man.""
""We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay's untimely death,"" one of his former teams, the Philadelphia Phillies, said in a statement. ""There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.""
During Halladay's 16 years in the league, he recorded a staggering 67 complete games — the most by any one player since he made his professional debut in 1998, according to MLB network columnist Jon Morosi. In 2010, he also pitched what was then only the 20th perfect game in MLB history.
Lately, as discussion of his career turned to when he would be inducted into the Hall of Fame, Halladay himself turned to another passion: flight. Just last month, ICON Aircraft delivered one of its aircraft — the first of its kind — to Halladay, prompting a meditation on his love for flying.
""I've been dreaming about flying since I was a boy but was only able to become a pilot once I retired from baseball,"" said Halladay, before going on to praise the plane he received, an A5.
In May, a prototype of the same aircraft claimed the lives of two ICON employees in a crash in California. However, a report released by the National Transportation Safety Board attributed that accident to pilot error.
Authorities say they found him after a private resident reported a crash at about midday and officials launched an hours-long search-and-rescue effort. Law enforcement ultimately found Halladay's plane in shallow water, with only Halladay onboard.
On social media, his loss drew an outpouring of support from friends, teammates, rivals and even some admirers, whom Halladay inspired to pursue baseball themselves.",0
"Google owns a company called Boston Dynamics, which has created what many news outlets are calling a “terrifying” humanoid robot.
According to reports, the “Atlas” robot, as it is called, failed miserably at the “Robot Olympics”. However, recent adjustments have allowed Atlas to now walk – unaided by a human – across rugged forest terrain.
RT News reported: If you go out in the woods today, you’re sure of a big surprise – that would be sound advice for residents around the Boston area. However, don’t expect to find anything remotely as cuddly or cute as a teddy bear’s picnic, because a hulking terminator-like robot has been spotted roaming around the area.
This is no hunter killer – well not yet anyway – it is a project by Boston Dynamics, a Google subsidiary, who specialize in robot design. Its creators have now let it out of the lab and into the open.
“We are interested in getting this robot out into the world. Out in the world is just a completely different challenge than in the lab. You can’t predict what it is going to be like,”said Marc Raibert, the founder of Boston Dynamics.
The Atlas robot would most likely intimidate anyone who came across its path. Standing at over 6 feet tall and weighing over 300 pounds – it is a massive technical achievement right out of the “Terminator” movies.
Though Atlas did poorly at the “Robot Olympic” competition, Mark Prigg of The Daily Mail explains: Boston Dynamics says its own software has taken some major steps forward since [the Robot Olympics].
‘We’ve been working on humanoid robots, derived from these models.
It has been studying the way humans and animals move in a bid to replicate, and even improve on it.
‘Our focus is on balance and dynamics, working in the way animals and people do, moving quickly to avoid falling.’
Raibert revealed the forest tests had gone well.
‘We’re interested in getting this robot out in the world, its a totally different, you can’t predict what its going to be like. All kinds of stuff happens, and we’re making pretty good progress in making it’s movement sort of within shooting range of yours, and if we keep pushing we’ll get there.’

Jim Carrey tells the truth about Hollywood in this really bizarre interview
Actor and comedian Jim Carrey shocked some with a very bizarre interview where he mocked the self-aggrandizement of Hollywood celebrities. (Image Source: Twitter video screenshot.)
Movie actor and comedian Jim Carrey is being lauded by some for a very bizarre interview in which he appears to mock Hollywood’s penchant for self-aggrandizement, but ends up saying nothing matters.
The interview with the 55-year-old movie star occurred at Fashion Week in New York City with E! News host Catt Sadler.
“Hey Jim Carrey,” Sadler said, “I’ve covered a lot of Fashion Weeks, this is the first time I’ve run in to Jim Carrey. Wait! Tell me, is it true you’re wandering the streets you need a date to the party? What’s up?
“No no, I’m doing just fine,” Carrey responded. “I just uh, there’s no meaning to any of this so I wanted to find the most meaningless thing that I could come to and join, and uh and uh, here I am.”
“I mean you gotta admit it’s completely meaningless,” he added.
“Well they say they’re celebrating icons inside do you believe in icons?” she asked.
“They’re celebrating icons, boy,” he responded, “that’s the most lowest aiming you know possibility that we could come up with.”
“I mean, do you believe in icons?” he asked her. “I believe in personalities. I don’t believe that you exist, but I believe there’s a wonderful fragrance in the air.”
“You don’t believe certain icons have the power to make change to think differently,” she challenged him, “to be bold, to inspire others, artistry? You’re one of them!”
“On the good foot! Hah!!” he exclaimed back, apparently quoting James Brown. “Shut her down now!”
“No, I don’t believe in icons,” he answered. “I don’t believe in personalities I believe that peace lies beyond personality, beyond invention in disguise. Beyond the red ‘S’ that you wear on your chest that makes bullets bounce off. I believe that it’s deeper than that. I believe that we’re a field of energy dancing for itself.”
“But Jim you got really dressed up for the occasion you look good. Is that an accident?” Sadler said, trying to get the interview back on track.
This Jim Carrey interview is great, not just for his answers but the poor interviewer trying to navigate through it. pic.twitter.com/ClNKzdBAZ7
“I didn’t get dressed up. There’s no me,” he said.
“There’s no you, we’re not here,” she responded, “this is a dream?
“There’s just things happening,” he replied. “And there are clusters of tetrahedrons moving around together.”
“So what’s happening in our world right,” she said, “now cuz there is a lot of news that actually is relevant that is not uplifting.”
“Here’s the thing, it’s not our world,” he responded.
“We don’t matter, we don’t matter,” he exclaimed, “that’s the good news!”
“OK!” she said, giving in.
Carrey is being applauded by many who say all he did was point out something many conservatives have been saying – there is little meaning in celebrity and the values of Hollywood are empty and vacuous.
But on the other hand, his quasi-philosophical musings seem out of place, and ineffective beyond their shock value. Yes, it’s satisfying to see a Hollywood star tear down the veil that actors and celebrities have built up around themselves, but we need to do more than just tear each other down if we really want to heal America.

"The world's primates face an ""extinction crisis"" with 60% of species now threatened with extinction, according to research.
A global study, involving more than 30 scientists, assessed the conservation status of more than 500 individual species.
This also revealed that 75% of species have populations that are declining.
The findings are published in the journal Science Advances.
Professor Jo Setchell from Durham University, a member of the team, explained that the main threats were ""massive habitat loss"" and illegal hunting.
""Forests are destroyed when primate habitat is converted to industrial agriculture, leaving primates with nowhere to live,"" she told BBC News.
""And primates are hunted for meat and trade, either as pets or as body parts.""
Other threats - all driven by human behaviour - are forest clearance for livestock and cattle ranching; oil and gas drilling and mining.
""The short answer is that we must reduce human domination of the planet, and learn to share space with other species,"" Prof Setchell commented.
The study also cited poverty and civil unrest as a driving force for hunting - in the poorest parts of the world many people are being driven to hunting primates in order to feed themselves.
""We need to focus on the development of these parts of the world and make sure people have an alternative source of protein,"" said Prof Serge Wich from Liverpool John Moores University.
He pointed out that the loss of primate species represented the loss of forests that are essential for the future of our own species.
""These forests provide essential services for people,"" he told BBC News.
""They help in being carbon stocks to mitigate climate change; they help in providing clean water and providing pollination services for people, so they can grow their crops.""
The researchers also pointed to some personal choices that people could make as consumers, particularly in the west, to avoid contributing to tropical deforestation.
But more broadly, ""we need to raise local, regional and global public awareness of the plight of the world's primates and what this means for ecosystem health, human culture, and ultimately human survival.
""In industrialised nations, we must decrease our demand for resources that we don't need, and stop confusing wants with needs.""
Dr Christoph Schwitzer, from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature is also director of conservation at Bristol Zoological Society. He told the BBC that it was his ""strong belief"" that ""with a concerted effort by the world's governments and conservationists, primate declines can be halted and populations stabilised"".
He added that changes in consumer behaviour could help, for example ""choosing FSC-certified wood and paper products, and making sure palm oil comes from sustainable sources"".
Dr Schwitzer added: ""Protected areas [of habitat] and efficient law enforcement will be key.""",0
"The first trailer has arrived for “The Post,” the star-studded Steven Spielberg-directed drama about The Washington Post’s decision to publish stories based on the classified Pentagon Papers in 1971. (And yes, we know the New York Times did itfirst.)Leading the cast is Meryl Streep, playing publisher Katharine Graham, and Tom Hanks as editor Ben Bradlee. The movie, with a screenplay by Liz Hannahand Josh Singer, focuses on the period leading up to publication, when Graham and Bradlee had to weigh whether going public with top secret documents against the government’s wishes was worth the risk.
“If the government wins, The Washington Post will cease to exist,” warns one character during the trailer.
[Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep to star in new Pentagon Papers film ‘The Post’]
The trailer debuted during “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert”Tuesday night, asthe host called it“a Marvel trailer if Meryl Streep was playing Thor.”
The movie gets a limited release on Dec. 22 — just in time for Oscars voting — which is no small feat, considering the film was only just announced this past March. That’s an uncommonly fast turnaround. The timing couldn’t be better for news organizations that have weathered accusations of “fake news” for the past year. Like 2016’s best picture winner, “Spotlight,” “The Post” is about journalists willing to hold powerful institutions accountable.
This won’t be the first time a story about The Washington Post vies for awards glory. “All the President’s Men” won four Oscars in 1977, though the movie lost the best picture prize to “Rocky.” However, Jason Robards, who played Bradlee, won for best supporting actor.

"The U. S. Navy guided-missile destroyer, USS John S. McCain, collided with a merchant vessel Monday morning near Singapore. Singaporean ships and the U.S. Navy are searching for 10missing sailors. Five were reportedlyinjured.
According to Fox News, the collision between the USS John S McCain and the 30,000-ton,600-foot Liberian Alnic MC oil tanker occurred at6:24 a.m. Japan Standard Time. Damage to the ship resulted in flooding to crew berthing, machinery, and communications rooms, according to the Navy.
The Navy did not immediately reveal exactly how the two massive ships collided, but the Navy reported that it is treating the incident as an accident.
Initial reports indicate #USSJohnSMcCain damaged to port side aft. Extent of damage and injuries being determined. https://t.co/dpMFyiG6H4
According to Fox News, the ship limped under its own power to theChangi Naval Base in nearby Singapore.
After the collision, a search began for 10missing sailors by American, Singaporean and Malaysian armed forces, according to Fox News. According to NBC News, Singapore has dedicated four ships from its Navy to the search effort, as well as three tugboats from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.
U. S. helicopters and Ospreys from the USS America are also assisting in the search for the missing sailors.
NBC News reported that five sailors were hurt during the crash, but none have suffered life-threatening injuries. Four were helicoptered out by the Singaporean Navy. One, who suffered only minor injuries, stayed with the ship.
According to NBC News, this is the fourth incident of a collision by an American Naval vessel in under a year.
Why this warship is important
The USS John S McCain is a ship that takes part in the U. S.-led Freedom of Navigation Operation (FONOP) in the South China Sea.
The warship was involved in a maneuver earlier this month that would keep China from claiming sole ownership of trade routes used byBrunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This trade routesees$5 trillion in ship-borne trade pass through it every year.
U. S. officials are concernedabout China’s construction of man-made islands, believing it an attempt to expand its land mass, and claim ownership of the South China Sea trade routes.The USS John S McCain’s recent FONOP is the third, and least ambiguous maneuver to challenge China’s ownership of the South China Sea trade routes. The warship navigated just 12 miles off of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands.
U. S. officials contend that some of these islands are man-made, and include military installations. China, however, denies this.
While many countries rely on these trade routes, they are reluctant to earn the ire of China, and rely on the U. S. and its power to push back on China’s claims to the routes.
Both Beijing and Washington have a high interest in the recourse-rich trade route. In order to keep it out of Chinese hands, the U. S. must consistently display a great show of military might to keep China at bay. The Navy has yet to say whether or not a warship will replace the USS John S McCain in the meantime.",0
"The war against Christians, their GOD, his holy word, and the whole Christian faith has been going on for many thousands of years. We witness more and more cases of bad behavior towards Christians, even though their religious views often lead to worshiping morality, personal responsibility, respect and understanding for others.
Luckily, so far all attempts have failed.
But now, ABC News’ Pete Madden and Erin Galloway reached a whole new level of bashing prominent Christian organization named Alliance Defending Freedom who is dedicated to defending “religious freedom, the sanctity of life, and marriage and family.”
In an article this week headlined, “Jeff Sessions addresses ‘anti-LGBT hate group,’ but DOJ won’t release his remarks.,” they smeared the nonprofit organization who believe the Bill of Rights secures religious liberty as a “hate group.”
Nice work ABC. They truly are “Fake News! It’s no wonder why journalist are held in such low esteem. They need to get back to reporting news instead of advocating for their biased political views.
The opening paragraph of the article stated that U. S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions “delivered a speech to an alleged hate group at an event closed to reporters on Tuesday night, but the Department of Justice is refusing to reveal what he said.”
Always love how they’re so courageous with Christian groups but shiver with their tails between their legs with the Muslim ones!
However, the Alliance Defending Freedom responded to the ABC News story. They called out Pete Madden and Erin Golloway for “journalistic malpractice,” slamming the reporters for using “false charges against Alliance Defending Freedom by a radically partisan, violence-inciting organization like Southern Poverty Law Center” in their story.
Also, American commentator Guy Benson and blogger Erick Erickson criticized ABC News for releasing this fake story.
If according to ABC, the Alliance Defending Freedom is a hate group, I wonder what that makes CAIR? A peaceful organization I bet!
America’s ” mainstream” media have shown themselves to be little more than the propaganda arm of the American hating leftist progressives. Their credibility is a memory.

"A former Trump campaign official is making extraordinary claims he was leaked information from within the White House that Las Vegas massacre gunman Stephen Paddock made an ISIS propaganda tape and that authorities are refusing to reveal that the mass shooting was a terror attack.
Former Massachusetts Trump campaign official James Brower posted a series of tweets last night claiming he was leaked information about Paddock being inspired by ISIS to carry out the mass shooting.
“There is a video, this video will prove the motive. He had a secret digital profile that was uncovered over the last 24 hrs,” claims Brower.
There is a video, this video will prove the motive. He had a secret digital profile that was uncovered over the last 24 hrs. https://t.co/SSJxnvasld
“Motive will be pretty shocking, I won’t say much but it will definitely change a lot of things going forward,” he added.
Motive will be pretty shocking, I won’t say much but it will definitely change a lot of things going forward.
“I’m being told the video basically speaks about a network, they wouldn’t tell me directly if it was ISIS but they threw little hints that it was,” Brower told Infowars.
“The reason the video more than likely is never released is because they believe it will trigger the “cells” he speaks of,” according to Brower.
“There should be a statement on motive soon,” he added, “They believe he was inspired by ISIS.”
He also claims that there was a second person who helped Paddock plot the attack that the gunman was seen with three days prior to the massacre. This individual left before the shooting began, according to Brower. Hotel receipts suggest that Paddock was with another person days before the shooting.
Authorities have now acknowledged that Paddock had “help” and originally planned to escape and carry out other atrocities. His car contained fertilizer that could be used to make explosives and 50 pounds of the explosive substance Tannerite, clearly suggesting he was planning a car bombing.
Brower claims the source leaking his the information is an individual within the Trump cabinet. The former Trump campaign official did previously release information about Paul Manafort being wiretappedbefore it became public.
Brower also claims that Paddock’s digital profile “showed he researched many of the massacres committed by IS lately in Europe.”
However, Fox News reports that after “Analyzing Paddock’s computer, cellphone and other electronic devices, investigators have found no obvious ideological motive, no clear connection to extremists or activist groups or outward display of mental illness.”
It is important to emphasize that Infowars does not endorse the veracity of Brower’s claims and they conflict with what officials investigating the case have revealed.
However, it’s important to add that Sheriff Joe Lombardo did acknowledge that the shooter may have been “radicalized” and that hemay have had an accomplice who helped organize the plot.
In addition, after ISIS released the latest issue of their newsletter, which showed a picture of the Mandalay Bay drenched in blood, New York Times correspondent Rukmini Callimachi noted that the terror group’s claim of responsibility may not have been false.

3. Below is the @siteintelgroup translation. ISIS earlier said shooter converted “months ago.” Now they’re saying it was 6 mos specifically pic.twitter.com/Lo6hF1S65M
Callimachi goes on to point out that “ISIS has rarely claimed attacks that were not by either their members or sympathizers” and that “In their chatrooms, they are claiming that the West and the media is leading a cover-up in order to hide the “martyrdom” of their brother.”

“This group has been more right than its been wrong,” she states, before asking that Paddock’s family be asked if he had converted to Islam.

"Like many of you, I get a substantial amount of my news from the Internet. Recently, I found several online items accusing Hillary Clinton and John Podesta (chairman of Hillary’s presidential campaign) of running an international pedophile ring out of a pizzeria in Washington, D. C., called Comet Ping Pong. Also implicated were the heads of state of several European countries and my Aunt Minnie. (Just kidding about Aunt Minnie.) The items seemed quite sober but upon further consideration, it occurred to me that the whole wacky mess could have been the product of Mad Magazine. An international child sex ring? The Clintons? Comet Ping Pong? Is someone pulling my leg?
Well, as a dyed-in-the-wool skeptic, I did a little research but could find no corroboration of the Ping Pong tale in any mainstream news outlet. Not that this would have been the first time that mainstream media failed to report important news. My new book—In Lies We Trust—describes how the media distorts the truth, omits key news, and lies outright, but this Ping Pong story stood out as just plain screwy. Guess what? It is screwy. The entire thing is a monumental lie, a shining example of what is now known as “fake news.”
There is nothing new about fake news. Satire has been a common ploy of the media since day one. A good example is Samuel Clemens (better known as Mark Twain), who was the author of many hoax articles. In fact, “Comet Ping Pong” is not the first fake news story to attract my attention. For some time, I have noticed an increase in far-out stories on the Internet. One storyline that made me laugh out loud alleges that Obama is planning a martial law takeover of the country with his own secret police force.
Where is all this insanity coming from? Frankly, who knows and who cares. The important thing is to be able to distinguish “fake news” from real news or at least from news that is commonly distorted by the mainstream media. Here are a few questions to ask that will help you recognize “fake news” when you see it:
Does it seem outlandish? If the story seems too crazy to be true, it probably is. The Comet Ping Pong affair fits in this category, as do stories predicting the end of the world. Pay attention to your intuition. If you have an emotional reaction to a story, recognize that something is afoot.
Is the source known to be questionable? For example, the National Inquirer and the Daily Mail are known to contain dubious items. Some sources are clearly “out there.” You need to be discriminating about where you get your news.
If it appears on the Internet, can you find corroboration in major news outlets? According to CQ Researcher, the problem with the Internet is that, “Anyone can post an article, book or opinion online with no second pair of eyes checking it for accuracy, as in traditional publishing and journalism.” If you don’t see it in the New York Times or on CNN, there is a good chance (but only a chance) that the item is “fake.”
Unfortunately, we are seeing so much lying and distortion from the mainstream media that the question of what is “fake” takes on new dimensions. Personally, I am more tolerant of “fake news” than biased spin from the Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC, etc. The latter is more difficult to identify because the sources have more gravitas. Mainstream media spin is what we really should be concerned about.

"Winstead: I kinda feel like it's like if everyone let go of all the Macy's balloons in the parade and they just started deflating and crashing into buildings — that's like my larger scope of the Trump presidency. Um, but I feel like the unpredictability of it is what makes it so scary.
You have argued that Hillary Clinton faced sexism in 2016. How did sexism play out?
Winstead: I think a lot of people woke up from the election the day after in a crumpled pantsuit, with food in their bra, saying, what happened to me? What am I gonna do? ... I think that when you look at how we even ignore the issues that face women — equal pay, reproductive rights and justice, gender justice — how it's not centered is as much as a telling piece of sexism as the overt sexism.
What about first lady Melania Trump? She also experienced some sexist dialogue.
Winstead: I feel that every woman is a victim of sexism and I feel like you gotta call it out no matter what, no matter how you feel about them. if you're not smart enough to call out people on their behavior and their policies and you immediately go to the looks well, it says more about you than it does about that person. I learn nothing from you if you make some crass comment about her modeling. Her advocacy is online bullying (laughs), there's plenty of jokes, to be had at the expense of the Trump family as a whole. What the women look like? I don't care.
Ivanka Trump has spoken out on women's issues but was met with some criticism from the left. Why is her message not resonating with some?
Winstead: I think that her message comes from a super privileged space ... Some people have jobs but they're not in a career. Some people are working two jobs trying to raise their kids, some people are tradespeople, you know, so it's like she doesn't have a clue about how to talk about anything other than the life she lives. And if you're not going to look at again, the full humanity of what women need in their daily lives, it's not always these executive-level, lean-in type programs.

Has late-night comedy evolved over the years?
Winstead: I think so. I think now that you add the digital aspect and social media to how you satirized things, I mean, we have you know, the first troll-in-chief and that is like a new experience to look at how you you talk about politics. I think that with Sam Bee ... the issues that affect women are centered, which is really cool. For the first time we're actually looking at the political ramifications of walking the earth with a uterus, which is kind of astounding.
Late-night comedy often blurs the line between news and comedy. Does it have news value or is it fake news? Where is the line?
Winstead: I think the line is in the information. I mean, when I was at ""The Daily Show"" we, you could fact check our show and it would be correct. Is it all the news you need? No. But, is it accurate? Yeah.
When Tomi Lahren was on ""The Daily Show"" with Trevor Noah she described it as being in ""the lion's den."" Does late-night comedy alienate conservatives?
Winstead: I feel like if you are alienated by comedy, ask yourself, about your own personal assessment ... ask yourself why you feel alienated. Are you willing to allow in all the information that surrounds you or are you desperately trying to cling to the set of facts you choose to believe even if they've been disproven as facts? And so, if late-night (comedy) alienates you, I would have to ask you, what is it about the truth that you feel alienated by?
""For the first time we're actually looking at the political ramifications of walking the earth with a uterus, which is kind of astounding.""
Lizz Winstead
Should comedians put in more effort to include more conservative guests?
Winstead: Well, I think conversation with people who don't think like you is always a good idea. Conversation with people who are willfully promoting fake news and pseudo science is legitimizing a platform of things that aren't true and I don't think that is good at all.
If you could send President Trump a message or a tweet what would you say to him?
Winstead: If I could say anything to Donald Trump it would be talk to some women, I think you need to.

"As a news network, Fox News is obliged to keep some liberal commentators on its staff so that liberal points of view can be expressed. Unfortunately, Fox News keeps renewing the contract of Juan Williams, who cannot seem to prevent himself from committing deeply embarrassing gaffes with stunning regularity.
He recently stuck his foot in his mouth when he appeared on a panel with former Democratic Rep. Jane Harman, who was secretly wiretapped by the federal government without her knowledge. Said Harman at the time,“I never had any idea that my government was wiretapping me at all. Three anonymous sources have told various media that this happened. And they are quoting snippets of allegedly taped conversations. So I don’t know what these snippets mean. I don’t know whether these intercepts were legal.”
Despite being aware of Harman’s history about being the victim of wiretapping, clueless Williams blurted out,“Just give me a moment here to say if you have a leak please call me at FOX News. I’m all for leakers. I think leakers are good to contribute to democracy.”
He added, “I don’t think trying to undermine government but I don’t think we condemned Obama for going harshly against people who were disclosing information acting as if they were agents of some foreign government. This is a democracy we have a First Amendment. Reporters play an essential role.”
Then he suddenly seemed to realize that he was in the same room as former Rep. Harman. However, this didn’t convince him to stop running his mouth. He added,“But guess what? We have as Jane Harman said a moment ago a history in this country of people talking to the press, leaking taking risks. I don’t see all of a sudden, oh just because of this president all of a sudden everybody who says you know what there’s a risk to democracy is to be condemned.” Harman shook her head while Williams said all this, and was right about to rebuke him, but Williams got saved by time running out on the show. Do you think Williams should be fired for saying this? Watch below:",1

"For most of 2016, the New York Daily News was America’s paper of opposition to Donald Trump. But in the months since the election, just as Trump’s war with the press started going nuclear, the Manhattan-based tabloid has largely pulled back on its famous anti-Trump covers in favor of a decidedly more measured tone.
The change followed a shakeup in editorial leadership just weeks before Nov. 8. The previous editor, Jim Rich, had been resisting pressure from management to soften the Trump covers, people familiar with the matter said. He was told they were diminishing an already much diminished print subscriber base, these people said, particularly among blue-collar readers in certain corners of New York’s outer boroughs, where Trump’s nationalistic populism apparently resonates in a way that is anathema to the city’s cosmopolitan districts and immigrant enclaves.
After Rich stepped down on Oct. 18, his successor, the Pulitzer Prize-winning, longtime News fixture Arthur Browne, made clear in a meeting with editors that he believed the paper’s front-page Trump coverage needed to take a different direction, sources familiar with the remarks told POLITICO. At times, he has described the earlier anti-Trumpism as an “adventure,” according to someone who heard the remark, suggesting that the adventure is over.
Now, many News staffers and alumni feel like the air has been sucked out of the room, and they are perhaps coming to terms with the notion that Trump is more popular with segments of their readership than they thought, even in deep blue New York.
“The dissent is probably close to unanimous,” one insider told POLITICO.
Throughout almost all of last year, the News fired off dozens of withering front pages opposing Trump’s candidacy — collected here in an online photo gallery — that were tailor-made to grab the attention of the national media and go viral online. It was a classic tabloid campaign, and it made people take notice of “the Newly Relevant Daily News,” as The New York Times described the century-old publication in a favorable profile last year.
That was then, this is now: The past four months have produced more ammunition than the entirety of Trump’s campaign. Yet even as many mainstream outlets have come under siege from the new administration, reaping the benefits of a “Trump bump” in the process, the News seems less inclined to bring out the cannons.
Out? Page 1 battle cries to “STOP THE DON CON” or “BURY TRUMP IN A LANDSLIDE” or “DELETE YOUR CAMPAIGN!” Takedowns like “OFF HIS MEDS!” or “HAD EYES FOR A 10-YEAR-OLD” or “LOCK HIM UP!”
In? Treatments that are generally more even-handed, sometimes delivered with an uppercut, but nonetheless a far cry from the swashbuckling crusade that put the News on the map during election season.
At a glance, this past Sunday's front page about the president’s unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor wiretapped Trump Tower — “NUTS!” — might seem like a scathing attack. The difference, some insiders would argue, is that under the previous regime, the News would have called Trump out directly, and aggressively, for being deceitful. (Hypothetical headlines: ""YOU'RE THE TRAITOR!""; ""BIGGEST LIE YET!"")
The anti-Trump “adventure” began when Rich was named editor in chief in September 2015 after rising through the ranks over the course of his 11 years at the News. On the heels of a similarly high-profile gun-control campaign kicked off by Rich’s predecessor, British tabloid veteran Colin Myler, Rich “doubled down on Myler’s emphasis … of publishing to the new digital beat: faster, more national, and increasingly fueled by a certain populist partisan glee,” as Sridhar Pappu put it in a New York magazine feature last January.
“The latest and most visible manifestation of that new strategic direction,” Pappu wrote, “is a reinvention of the paper’s ‘wood’ — newsman-speak for page one — for an era of hyperpartisan social sharing. Just as tabloid covers used to amuse, inform, and outrage passersby on the sidewalk, enticing them to pick them up and read all about it, the Daily News has arguably been the most aggressive and successful newspaper brand at turning the old-school institution of a front page into an irresistibly ‘like’-able image on Facebook ”
Covers like this one of Trump beheading the Statue of Liberty, from the Dec. 19, 2015 edition, were the talk of TV news and digital media, and the bosses seemed thrilled. During a rare newsroom appearance last January, according to people who were there, owner Mort Zuckerman, the 79-year-old real estate mogul and long-time Democratic donor, gushed about what the News was doing and all the buzz it was getting. At one point, according to two of the sources present, he turned to Rich and quipped, “Where have you been all my life?” (It’s no secret in New York media circles that Zuckerman’s health is in decline, which is why he has now fully stepped away from running the paper, entrusting that responsibility to his nephew, Eric Gertler.)
Starting in the summer, however, Rich began hearing complaints from management, according to sources familiar with the matter. They said he was asked to dial down the Trump fronts because they were costing the News subscriptions in places like Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. After Rich stepped down amid a disagreement putatively having to do with cost-cutting, it quickly became clear that things were about to change. (Rich would not comment for this story.)
Browne did one more front page in the previous mold — “HOUSE OF HORRORS,” with an upside down American flag on the White House lawn — the day after the election. But it was “the last of that breed,” a News journalist said, adding that the change “was jarring and confusing, and it felt like the rug had been pulled out from under us.”
In an interview, Browne disputed that the shift was a business calculation. Rather, he said, it had to do with covering Trump the candidate versus Trump the president.
“It’s one thing when you are taking a stand against a candidate both on personality and on policy grounds, and you want to depict him as a clown,” Browne said. “Once an election is over, I think it would be counterproductive and ineffective to continue to depict someone as a clown. How many times can you do that? ... The difference here, and I think this is really significant, is that we’re not attacking or commenting on the man. We are reporting on the policies and the actions as this administration plays out.”
Nevertheless, there’s a palpable sense of demoralization within the newsroom. Even if not everyone was on board with Rich’s approach, which people who worked for him agreed was “polarizing,” the place had begun to feel like it was alive again, and on a mission.
Unlike broadsheet newspapers, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, which keep their opinions in the opinion section even when their news coverage veers into adversarial territory, tabloids have a long tradition of adopting strong positions on divisive issues, and of editorializing or advocating on the front page. That’s how the News was able to get a piece of the Trump story despite the atrophy of its national political-reporting muscles.
“Even if we weren’t in a position where could really be breaking Trump news because we don’t have a big staff or resources, we were still able to be a leading voice in the conversation because we were channeling the outrage around his rhetoric,” a News journalist told POLITICO, summarizing frustration within the newsroom thus: “Now that much of the country and the rest of the world is galvanizing, we’re taking a step back. … The energy has left the room. It just really feels like a missed opportunity. That’s what’s killing me.”
Brown pushed back on the suggestion that the way the News has handled Trump under his editorship has been soft or cautious. During a phone call, he rattled off a list of recent front pages that he said didn’t pull any punches, including: “RUSSIAN FOR THE EXIT”; “CLOSING THE GOLDEN DOOR”; “BANANAS!”; “POOR BABY!” and “WAR ON TRUTH.”
“I will leave you to make the judgment about those front pages and the consistency of the coverage,” he said.
But various current and former News journalists pointed to specific examples they said were “galling,” as one put it. For instance, the day after Trump unloaded on the media during an hour-and-a-half news conference, a spectacle that dominated the news cycle into the weekend, Trump wasn’t even the lead story on the wood — he was eclipsed by Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis’ assault and robbery charges. (The New York Post that morning went big with Trump done up in circus garb: “WILDEST SHOW ON EARTH - Ringmaster Don whips media in epic rant.”)
The cover that raised the most eyebrows among News insiders and tabloid-ologists was the paper’s inauguration edition, “DON OF A NEW DAY.” It was shocking, some of them said, not just because of its reverential tone, but because it was the exact same headline used by the Post, a red-blooded rival owned by Trump-supporting mogul Rupert Murdoch. (And a reliable proponent of right-wing causes over the years, whereas the News has traditionally been more progressive.)
“I saw that, and my jaw hit the f--king floor,” said someone who worked at the News for a long time but would only comment anonymously, like most of the current and former News-ers who spoke with POLITICO for this article. “To align so perfectly on this, that was to me where the News reached rock bottom.”
“The ‘Don of a New Day’ cover was a disgrace, and it was so disheartening for those of us who took pride in what the Daily News had done with Trump and the election,” said Andy Martino, a reporter at the News before opting to take one of the buyout packages offered to staff at the end of last year. “After nearly two years of calling Trump what he is — a clown and a dangerous racist, among other things — the paper normalized him at the worst possible time. That told you all you need to know about the shift away from an essential place in the conversation.”
Browne, who was head of the editorial board when it published an 8,000 word piece laying out why Trump shouldn’t be elected, isn’t fazed by the critics.
“They can be galled all they like,” he said. “If somebody is an anti-Trump partisan, and believes the Daily News should carry out their own anti-Trump partisanship, then that’s too bad.”
In any case, as America goes farther down the rabbit hole of Trump’s chaotic, confounding, anything-goes presidency, and as his war with the news media (presumably) intensifies, there will be no shortage of opportunities to ignite some real tabloid fire in New York, a media and political capital where Trump’s history with the tabloids is the stuff of legend.
“I think the potential is still there for them,” said George Rush, the former longtime Daily News gossip columnist. “Their best way of staying in the story is to take the role of the gadfly, and to do it with satire, because that’s what resonates. If they don’t continue to roast him, I think it would be a missed opportunity.”",0

The Most Feared Equation In The World
The techniques I developed for studying turbulence, like weather, also apply to the stock market.
Benoit Mandelbrot (1924-2010) Polish-born, French and American mathematician who discovered the Mandelbrot set of intricate, never-ending fractal shapes named in his honor.
Special Report from Sister Ciara
The mathematical equation you are viewing right above these words is, without a doubt, the most feared one in the worldso feared in fact that it led to one of the worlds top economists, Martin Armstrong, being jailed without charges or trial for over 7 years in the United States because he not only discovered how this equation worked in relation to stock markets, he refused to divulge exactly how he discovered it was so.
The complete saga of how Martin Armstrong rose from being a millionaire at the age of 15, to becoming the most feared economist in the world is not the intention of this letterbut is a most fascinating story everyone should become acquainted with, and just click HERE to find out why.
Instead what I want to focus on here is how, like Martin Armstrong applied this equation to stock markets, the Sisters have, likewise, successfully applied it to newsmore specifically predictive news.
This most feared equation is called the Mandelbrot Set and is the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z)=z+c does not diverge when iterated, i.e., for which the sequence f(0), f(f(0)), etc., remains boundedand dont worry if you dont understand this because even some scientists have enormous difficulty understanding it too.
And just like one can use a modern smartphone without having the slightest idea of how it is made, or even being able to describe all of the parts that make it, so too is the Mandelbrot Set utilized in many spheres and disciplines by experts who cant fully describe it, they only know that it works.
At the heart of the Mandelbrot Set equation, you see, is the repetition of patterns at all scales from micro (tiny) to macro (large)which more simply put means that everything known to man is locked in a never ending series of repeating cycles.
And with this being so, the ability to predict anything is only limited by knowing its full cyclewhich for almost everything is nearly impossible due to the infinite universe we live in.
This cannot, however, be said about the historical cycles of man (History Always Repeats Itself) as for thousands of years the circular nature of governments, societies, economies, wars, you name it, have not only been extremely well documented, they make the world we live in today as predictable as the headlines of yesterdays newspaper.
Even the Bible knows the truth of Mandelbrot Set and in the Old Testament Book of Ecclesiastes (Chapter 1 Verse 9) it plainly states: What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.
Just knowing the Mandelbrot Set equation though, and attempting to apply it to whatever ones particular discipline may be, is not easily done because of the synergy of experience needing to make it workafter all, and as well put by Martin Armstrong himself, I can read a book on how to do brain surgery. Would you like to be my first patient?
But in the right hands of those knowledgeable, like the Sisters, about the Mandelbrot Set, and in knowing the cycles of man too, the results of combining them are astoundedly predictive and have produced for us these results:
On 28 June 2007, the Sisters in their report titled US Banking Collapse Imminent Warns French Banking Giant gave you a nearly one and a half years warning about the 2008 global market crash.
On 25 October 2008, the Sisters in their report titled Iranian Leader In Secret Meet With Obama At US Military Stronghold In Hawaii gave you a 7 year warning about the United States rapprochement with Iran this past week.
On 1 August 2014, the Sisters in their report titled India Shocks World, Joins Russia Against Obama Regime told you the truth that the Western invasion of Libya was related to the planned Gold Dinar, and which only this week a US State Department email released under court order confirmed was true.
These are only three of the hundreds of such examples I can cite (and for those of you who have followed us for years well know he truth of), and the other commonality they have was at the time of the Sisters publishing them were met with high ridicule and disdain.
And the reason for this being so was revealed by Edward Snowden, who not only told the world about the United States governments extreme hatred of truth tellers like the Sisters, he also provided classified US documents [Warning: Under US Federal law, it is a crime for government employees or active military service members to click on the preceding link] detailing how the American intelligence community showing how US intelligence have actively infiltrated the Internet to manipulate, deceive and destroy the reputation of the Sisters and everyone else like them.
At the exact same time these US intelligence agencies launched their war against the Sisters and other truth tellers, you should also understand, the New York Times admitted that nearly every news organization in America allows the news to be censored by government officials, and for the first time in American history, a law was passed allowing the US government to use propaganda against its own citizens.
So let me boil the essence of this letter down for you:
At the exact same time that the Sisters continue to risk everything to keep the truth flowing to you, your own government is, beyond dispute, censoring the news youre allowed to know while openly propagandizing against you tooand you still believe and support their mainstream media publications over ours?
Now I happen to believe that once anyone, especially YOU, knows the truth of a thing they will act in their best interest to defend what they know is right and trueafter all, this battle is all about equationsours being the utilization of the Mandelbrot Set equation versus theirsGarbage In, Garbage Out.
To who wins this battle is, also, entirely up to YOUeither support us, or those like us, who want to see you educated and knowing the truth, or continue to support those who have openly told you they are deliberately manipulating you.
They believe you to be nothing more than ignorant religious nuts and gun clinging psychopaths not deserving of anythingwe, on the other hand, KNOW you to be just frightened about a world that has become so complex and convoluted you dont even recognize it anymore.
But let me tell you a secretthey can only win if they keep you scared, we can only win if you arent.
Which are you going to be?
With God,

"Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein threatened the lawyers at Facebook, Twitter and Google claiming that they didn’t do enough to stop what she sees is ‘fake news’. She attacked them for not filtering out ‘Russian propaganda’.
“You’ve created these platforms & now they are being misused and you have to be the ones to do something about it or we will,” said Feinstein. It’s certainly dangerous for the government to tell social media what they must do. Communist countries like China are known for doing this.
“I must say, I don’t think you get it. You’re general counsels, you defend your company. What we’re talking about is a cataclysmic change. What we’re talking about is the beginning of cyber warfare. What we’re talking about is a major foreign power with the sophistication and ability to involve themselves in a presidential election and sow conflict and discontent all over this country,” said Feinstein.
“We are not going to go away, gentlemen. And this is a very big deal. I went home last night with profound disappointment. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers. And that just won’t do. You have a huge problem on your hands,” said Feinstein.
“And the U. S. is going to be the first of the countries to bring it to your attention, and other countries are going to follow I’m sure. Because you bear this responsibility,” she said. Check out the video below.

It takes more than a couple brain cells to make this show what it is... so let's give credit where credit's due.
Prior to becoming host of Wait Wait in 1998, Peter had a varied career including stints as a playwright, screenwriter, stage director, actor, extra in a Michael Jackson video, travel writer, essayist, ghostwriter and staff writer for a motorcycle magazine. In October 2007, Harper Collins published Peter's first book, The Book of Vice: Naughty Things and How to Do Them, a series of essays about bad behavior, which was released in paperback in 2008. He lives in the Chicago area with his family. Since he now has his own Web site, he is finally a real boy.
For many, Bill Kurtis was the face, the voice, and the hair of the news in Chicago. Along with his co-anchor, Walter Jacobson, Bill brought authority and integrity to CBS-affiliate WBBM.

Carl Kasell is the scorekeeper emeritus for Wait Wait and is an all-around genius and great guy. A veteran broadcaster, Carl launched his radio career more than 50 years ago. He was a newscaster for NPR's daily newsmagazine Morning Edition from the show's beginning in 1979 until December 2009. Carl now enjoys sleeping past 1:05 am, and he sometimes moonlights as a magician. Click here to listen to some of the messages that Carl has put on the answering machines of some of our lucky winners.
Doug Berman is the Peabody Award-winning producer of NPR's Car Talk and Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! For the last 15 years, he's been on a one-man crusade to get NPR to lighten up. He was a news director at NPR member stations WFCR in Amherst, Mass., and WBUR in Boston before giving up his legitimate career for this stuff.
Mike Danforth joined Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! in November of 2000, after a distinguished tenure at Prairie Home Companion in his home state of Minnesota. His first week was spent weeding through numerous hanging chad jokes to find the best ones. He also tutors the staff in Foley-like vocal sound effects. And does not look like Andy Dick. At all.
Ian comes to Wait, Wait from the Internet, where he was the voice of a tiny blue cartoon news anchor. Before that, he worked on NPR's Fresh Air and The Bryant Park Project. His reporting has been heard on Marketplace, Studio 360 and other public radio programs. He plans to eat his weight in bratwurst his first year in Chicago.
Robin comes to Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! after spending a decade bringing sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll to public radio fans as the Senior Producer of Sound Opinions. She's relieved to know that Wait Wait fans already have their own sex and drugs. Prior to that she worked at All Things Considered and served at the pleasure of President Linda Wertheimer as her inaugural intern. Her pleasure? Mostly Chipotle. Robin's pleasure? The Real Housewives. No, make that ""radio."" No, ""her kids."" Doh!
Miles is a former producer and director for WBEZ and a current baker of cookies and maker of messes. He hates writing bios about himself, so he'll let his Wikipedia page do the talking: The page ""Miles Doornbos"" does not exist.
After many years spent as an award-winning theatrical sound designer and audio theater producer, Robert Neuhaus went in search of even larger egos than the theater can contain and found them at Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Robert has served as a recording engineer based in NPR's Chicago Bureau since 1988, but he still moonlights from time to time creating storms and battles for Chicago Shakespeare Theater.
Lorna discovered public radio during her college years at Illinois State University. After graduation, she moved to Washington, D. C., and shoved her foot in the front door of NPR. There, she discovered the joys of shift work and spent many sleep-deprived years on Morning Edition with Bob Edwards and Carl Kasell. Eventually Lorna moved on to Performance Today (classical music!), All Things Considered (news!), Weekend Edition (more news!), and NPR Master Control (look busy!). In 1996, she became the NPR Chicago Bureau Engineer and moved back to The Great Midwest. In 1998, Carl tracked her down and introduced her to Peter Sagal and the gang. Now she devotes her time to WWDTM, her family, and her spinning wheels.",0

"The Anonymous campaign against the global banking cartel, OpIcarus: Shut Down The Banks, is gaining momentum as nine Rothschild owned central banks were taken offline after the hacking collective identified the global financial system as the “power behind the throne” of the New World Order, and issued a global call to arms to fight the financial system that is enslaving us.
According to a video released in conjunction with OpIcarus, the attack on Bank of Greece marked the beginning of a “30-day campaign against central bank sites across the world.” This massive push, according to the video, aims to “strike at the heart of [the] empire by once again throw[ing] a wrench into the machine.”
In some of the most recent attacks over the weekend, hackers reportedly targeted the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, the Dutch Central Bank, the Central Bank of Maldives, and Guernsey Financial Services Commission, according to the official@OpIcarus Twitter account.
“We are enslaved within a matrix of institutions with the illusion that each stands alone, fighting for power, for profits, for the scraps on the table that represent humanities dwindling resources. In reality however, these institutions – the arms industries, banking and other financial institutions, government intelligence agencies and countless others, have formed what was once a clandestine coalition whose corruption, and avarice have become increasingly transparent due to WikiLeaks and to the efforts of Anonymous. This coalition seeks the preservation and the perpetuation of the powers that be, and this octopus operates through the tentacles of the IMF, the Federal Reserve, and the World Bank, masterminded by think-tanks such as the Bilderberg group, and the Council on Foreign Relations.
But where does the power behind the throne lie? Within the global financial system, centered within the New York Stock Exchange, and Bank of England,” the manifesto reports.
The National Bank of Panama and the Central Bank of Kenya were also reportedly targeted a day later, according to hacking news publicationHackRead.
What began as an Anonymous operation has now become a joint op between Anonymous and the GhostSquadHackers, with reported GSH member, s1ege tweeting about taking the Central Bank of Bosnia-Herzegovina offline and providing a screenshot to verify.
The twitter account @BannedOffline also reported the Central Bank of Mexico had succumbed to a DDoS attack by the hacking collective.
Anonymous has released a list of institutions the collective plans to target, which is divided into four sections; websites associated with the U. S. Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), sites owned by the World Bank, and over 150 sites associated with national banks around the globe.
Thus far, in less than a week, OpIcarus hackers have now hit ten of the financial institutions they’ve listed in an online manifesto, but questions remain as to whether these elite hackers will be able to bypass the intense security measures of the more prestigious institutions on their target list.",1

"PostEverything     Perspective  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events       I’m still reeling from the Las Vegas massacre. But everyone else has moved on.    The deadly mass shooting was just weeks ago, but it's as though it never happened.         Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.    You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.
The deadly mass shooting was just weeks ago, but it's as though it never happened.           Amanda Getchell grew up shooting guns but after surviving the Las Vegas massacre, she wants semi-automatic assault rifles banned. The problem, she says, is that everyone seems to have moved on. (Adriana Usero,Kate Woodsome/The Washington Post)    I was singing and swaying in a crowd of 22,000 that Sunday night in Las Vegas, loving every minute of the country music concert, when gunfire erupted. Seconds later, I was running for my life, and nothing would ever be the same for me. It has beena month since the largest mass shooting in modern American history, and it seems everyone has moved on. The passionate conversation about gun control — and the counter-conversation about how this isn’t the time to talk about gun control — have ceased. Every day since the shooting, I’ve checked the news. I scrolled through article after article to look for updates on the people I met while I was at the concert, to see whether they are alive or injured. And I watched as day after day, the Las Vegas massacre sank behind other stories, until eventually it disappeared from the news completely. It’s like it never happened. My phone stopped ringing with concerned calls and text messages. I see people in the store laughing and talking as if nothing has interrupted their lives. My friends are posting about their next vacation on social media. The mourning lasted a day, and then everyone forgot about what happened in Las Vegas. I haven’t forgotten. I can’t forget the horrifying sound of rapid-fire bullets chasing me. I can’t forget the moment I accepted that I was going to die. The 11 minutes of gunfire felt like an eternity. As soon as we thought it was over, it started again. It felt like a nightmare on a loop. Three hundred and sixty-three people have been killed and 1,346 injured in mass shootings inthe United States this year. I’m one of the untold number of people who survived an American mass shooting this year and are now left outraged and scared, thankful to be alive but confused. I feel connected to the survivors of past shootings: Pulse nightclub, the Aurora movie theater, Columbine High School. I wonder what thoughts ran through their heads when they saw the news about Las Vegas, and I dread what I will feel when I hear about the next mass shooting.   [I was quietly relieved that the Las Vegas shooting was white]   Any rapid sound makes me jump now. The sound of the suitcase wheels in the airport when I landed back in Albuquerque had me ducking for cover. The off-balance fan in my bedroom now makes my heart race and my palms sweat. The Fourth of July used to be one of my favorite holidays, but now I don’t know whether I’ll ever be able to enjoy fireworks again. I tested my nerves at the International Balloon Fiesta just a few weeks ago. The crowd brought me to a point of dread, and the sound of the fireworks turned my anxiety into actual tears and then a full-blown panic attack. The worst part is that we — me, my friend and the thousands of people who escaped death that night — are all still wondering: Why? Why did this man hurt so many? No one seems to care to figure it out. Everyone was so interested in conspiracy theories and heartbreaking stories, until they weren’t.   [Why I boycotted Congress’s empty moment of silence for gun violence victims]   In a way, I don’t blame the people around me for moving on so quickly. Part of me wants to forget, too, and go back to the happy and naive self I was before. But I want to keep talking. I still wear my wristband from the concert, hidden under my sleeve. I can’t place why. Maybe it’s a physical reminder of what I’ll never forget. At times, I catch myself acting normal,as I did before the event, and then I hear something that sets me off and brings me back to that moment that I accepted my death. After the Pulse shooting in 2016, I begged my dad to get rid of his AR-15. I believe in the right to protect yourself by owning a firearm for self-defense, but these weapons are used for offensive strikes. Now, my new fear is that my dad will get rid of the weapon, but it will end up in the wrong hands — and someone else will be going through what I am. That’s the most disheartening thing: Everyone knows it’s just a matter of time before another mass shooting occurs. How many times must we grieve and forget before action is taken? How many people will be killed in the next mass shooting? Why do we allow people to own weapons of war and mass destruction and act as though there’s nothing we can do about it? These are the questions I ask myself every day. I understand that Americans need to keep living their lives, but I hate seeing how little we’ve learned, how Las Vegas will make no difference.",0

"Is Facebook just really good at giving the public what it wants, or is this Professor blowing the whistle on something significant?
He’s making some pretty strong claims about the social media powerhouse. Do YOU believe him?
Sean Parker, 38, Facebook’s founding president spoke at an Axios event and gave some ‘behind the scenes’ information on social media platforms and human psychology.
He claims that social media exploits the reward centers of the brain using a positive reward feedback loop. He literally compared the process of consciously exploiting human psycology to the way a hacker consciously exploits the software of a computer. Not just Facebook per se, but all social media as a whole.
He’s essentially saying that we’re addicts. And more, that was the goal all along.
Remember when we used to laugh at people who had to be ‘connected’ all the time? We used to use words like ‘CrackBerry’ (speaking of people who had to check their Blackberry ever couple of minutes). But as a culture, we’ve already shifted so far that restaraunts are offering rewards to customers who leave their phones out of reach while on silent so they can have an uninterrupted conversation, and there are social penalties about the first one to pick up his phone during a meal having to pay the whole table’s tab.
That’s a change many of us never saw coming.
Check out what Parker — himself a Facebook insider — is publicly saying about how Facebook grew to be the juggernaut so many of us have come to know and use:
The legitimate concern over how social media (and technology in general) affects the developing brain has been well-documented.
That would throw a lot of those ‘Digital Detox challenges’ into a different light. There are lots of them online.
Here’s the comments from one writer in Australia who took such a challenge. Ask yourself whether this lines up with what Parker is saying about social media platforms generally.
Normally I check my phone each time I get a notification, and outside of that I check Facebook every 30 minutes, Snapchat every hour, Instagram every two hours and Twitter every four hours, so I feel anxious at the idea of taking five days off. I use social to contact people and stay up-to-date with my friends and the world, so I think I will feel a bit lost. I tell my close friends that I won’t be contactable on social media – they’ll have to text or email.
Right after deleting the apps, I feel liberated – as if I will immediately become more productive. But 30 minutes later I start to kick myself. I will miss Facebook the most because my friends organise social events and I won’t know what’s going on. After a few hours I imagine there is something that I’m missing out on already and I feel stressed about it. I try to distract myself by shopping online. I know that I’m probably not missing anything important, but I still feel the need to get back on and see what I’ve missed. When I go to bed I have an unsettling feeling because I always look at my accounts before going to sleep. [emphasis added]

"As we have all come to expect from the MSM, the near constant denigration of Donald Trump continues. The News Media that promises us balanced voices, and real opinion, are yet again attempting to indoctrinate us with a single ideological viewpoint: Trump=bad.
But on ABC’s “This week with George Stephanopoulos,” in what was the usual “Trump Bash”, there was one dissenting voice against the whole panel: Newt Gingrich. And he wasn’t going to let them get away with their bias and paradoxes anymore.
Gingrich interrupted the “witch burning” and told them some home truths. He said to Stephanopoulos, that he’d been wrong about Trump since day one, and they all lived in “an alternative universe that is completely divorced from reality”.
And Newt is right. This is why there is such a disconnect between the political elite and the MSM to the actual people on the street. We live in different worlds where reality bites harder in ours. Their Universe is cotton coated and everyone has the same opinions (a complete feedback loop), and anyone with dissenting opinions can just be disparaged as a “racist” or a “bigot” or even just a “white male”.
We need more people like Newt to stand up to the delusional media and show them the stark reality of life in America.",1
"Former E! News host Catt Sadlershared a new post about her recent departure from the entertainment news show, urging fans not to blame her decision to leave on friend and former co-host, Jason Kennedy.
Sadler posted her first response late Thursday in regards to her departure from E! on Instagram. The post featured a photo which read: “Speak the truth, even if your voice shakes.”
In the photo’s caption, Sadler opened up to fans about her emotional decision and thanked them the outpour of support that she had received over the past few days.
“I couldn’t let another minute go by without acknowledging the overwhelming love and support I’ve been receiving the last 24 hours.Leaving E was one of the hardest decisionsI’ve ever made, but your messages and heartfelt comments are comforting and affirm for me that I made the right decision,” Sadler wrote. “So many of you have similar stories, similar struggles, legitimate frustrations and I want you to know I hear you and feel for you. As a result, I have a renewed sense of purpose and genuine passion to right the wrongs. We are stronger together and I feel your strength at my core.”
Though the 43-year-old host citied the large pay gap as her reason for leaving the network she called home for 12 years, Sadler felt it was crucial to let fans know that her co-host, Kennedy, was not to blame for her leaving.
“If I had one ask, it is to please not place blame on my friend Jason Kennedy. He has done right by me in every respect. It hurts me deeply to see that some are vilifying him,” she added. “I repeat, his hands are tied on this matter and if you’re angry – rightfully so – direct that emotion at the decision makers who failed us, not him. All my love + gratitude.”
Sadler shocked E! fans on Tuesday when the TV host announced that she was leaving the show after discovering a massive pay disparity between herself and her longtime co-host. After Sadler’s last show aired on Tuesday evening, the host shared her true reason for leaving E! in an emotional post on her blog, The Catt Walk.
“An executive from E brought something alarming to my attention — namely, that there was a massive disparity in pay between my similarly situated male co-host and myself. More recently, when E reached out to renew and extend my deal, I learned that he wasn’t just making a little more than I was,"" Sadler explained in her blog. ""In fact, he was making close to double my salary for the past several years.”
Since Catt’s announcement, many celebrities such asJennifer Lawrence,Jessica ChastainandOlivia Munn, have praised Sadler on social media for taking a stance and doing what she believed was right.
After the reasoning for Catt’s departure from E! circulated, the channel released a statement toPeopleon behalf of the network and Kennedy, which said, “E! compensates employees fairly and appropriately based on their roles, regardless of gender. We appreciate Catt Sadler’s many contributions atE! Newsand wish her all the best following her decision to leave the network.”
E! News, an affiliate of NBC, has seen a lot of change in the past few months. Back in October, the show’s correspondent Ken Baker wasfired after allegations of sexual harassment. Former network interns spoke out against Baker and claimed that the correspondent did things such as propositioning sex and sending crude text messages, and was even accused of forciblykissing one intern.
The Baker scandal came on the heels of NBC news analyst Mark Halperin being accused of harassing women in the workplace, and a month before the network's “Today” show host Matt Lauer wasfiredfrom his 20-year post for alleged sexual misconduct. Since Lauer’s firing,several womenhave come forward to reveal their stories about the news anchor.
Controversy has also beset the network's cable news operation. MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews reportedly made inappropriate jokes and comments about a woman in front of others in 1999 while at CNBC, resulting in a $40,000 payout, according to the Daily Caller.",0

"Google has begun “reviewing the claims” of Your News Wire and other alternative media sites by linking to left-leaning “fact checking” sites when people search for “Yournewswire.com” or “Your News Wire”.
Google’s biography box for Your News Wire, which is shown with related search results, now has a “Reviewed Claims” tab which displays a Your News Wire headline and an associated article from Soros-funded and discredited fact-checking sites such as Snopes, Politifact and Factcheck.org who all dispute the veracity of our content.
Infowars.com reports: The problem is that these “fact checking” sites are not as unbiased as they claim and are typically aligned with establishment interests, particularly those of Silicon Valley which wanted Hillary Clinton in the White House.
“Most ‘fact checkers’ are merely liberal journalists looking to prove their preconceived narrative,”wrotethe Washington Times’ Kelly Riddell. “They cherry-pick the statements to ‘fact-check’ and then decide which data to back it up with.”
“Statistics can be manipulated — for every study coming out of the Brookings Institute, the Heritage Foundation can have a counter argument, depending on the methodology and surveys used. Moreover, much of what they decide to ‘fact-check’ is subjective at best. Nothing that can be pinned down with undisputed data.”
In short, “fact checking” is opinion journalism pretending to be some sort of heightened objectivity, as the Wall Street Journal’s James Taranto so eloquently stated.
The public largely agrees; most voters didn’t trust the media “fact checking” the news cycle during the presidential campaign, according to a survey.
“Most voters believe news organizations play favorites when it comes to fact-checking candidates’ statements, but this skepticism is much stronger among voters who support Donald Trump than those who back his rival Hillary Clinton,” the studystated. “A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that just 29% of all Likely U. S. Voters trust media fact-checking of candidates’ comments.”
“Sixty-two percent (62%) believe instead that news organizations skew the facts to help candidates they support.”
Snopes in particular, which was founded by then-husband-and-wife David and Barbara Mikkelson, was recently entangled in controversy whenDavid was accused of embezzling almost $100,000 from the site to pay for prostitutesin divorce documents filed by Barbara.
“The two also dispute what are basic facts of their [divorce] case – despite Snopes.com saying its ‘ownership’ is committed to ‘accuracy and impartiality,’” the Daily Mailreported, rather ironically.
Google’s latest disinformation campaign is a digital “Night of the Long Knives” targeting those who routinely counter establishment talking points, and it was likely conceived in the aftermath of Clinton losing the 2016 presidential election.
But the elites have already lost; we’ve already passed the Rubicon in which people would rather think for themselves by taking bits and pieces of the news cycle – removing establishment disinformation in the process – to form their own analysis rather than simply being spoonfed their “opinions” from “fact checking” sites.",1

"The CIA has concluded that Russia mounted a covert intelligence operation to influence the U. S. election in an effort to help Donald Trump win, a congressional official knowledgeable on the matter told NBC News.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper briefed senators on the latest intelligence in a closed-door meeting last week, and he described the latest findings on the intentions of the Russian government with regard to the hacks and other interference in the U. S. presidential election, according to the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the intelligence.
A Washington Post report published online Friday night first described how the intelligence community has reached a ""consensus"" that Russia intervened in the presidential election to help Trump win — not just try to sow chaos and undermine the electoral process. The New York Times confirmed the story, as has NBC News.
The president-elect's transition team responded by impugning the CIA’s integrity in a statement Friday, calling the spy agency ""the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.""
Trump has repeatedly said he does not accept the findings of the spy agencies he will soon lead. They say Russia was behind hacks of Democratic email accounts and other efforts that appeared to harm Hillary Clinton’s candidacy.
In October, the U. S. government said that all 17 intelligence agencies agreed Russia was behind the cyber-attacks just before the November election, and that the goal was ""to interfere with the U.S. election process.”
Now, the Congressional official told NBC News, new intelligence suggests that Russia’s goal was to elect Trump, who broke from Republican orthodoxy during the campaign with several sympathetic statements about a Russian regime that has seized a neighbor's territory and is accused of killing political opponents.
Senators were briefed last week on the secret CIA assessment, the source said, confirming reports in the Post and Times.
In an interview Saturday with MSNBC’s Joy Reid, outgoing Democratic leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, who was among those briefed, accused FBI director James Comey of withholding information about the Russian campaign from the public. He said Comey should resign.
“Intelligence agencies have been finding connections to the Russian government,” Sen. Reid said. “There’s no question about that.”
Reid added, “The FBI had this material for a long time. But he, Comey, who is Republican, refused to divulge this information regarding Russia in the presidential election.”
The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
NBC News previously reported that Russians allegedly used hacking groups to provide material to WikiLeaks at the behest and direction of the Russian government.
The Post and The Times said the U. S. had identified specific Russian actors who had turned over the material to WikiLeaks.
Separately, another source briefed in the intelligence told NBC News that the U. S. government has identified specific Russian actors it believes were involved in the hacks, based on intercepted communications, human source tips and computer forensics.
The Times reported that the CIA assessed that Republican entities also were hacked, but that none of the material contained through the hacks was leaked.
NBC News reported in October that Republican operatives and officials had been targeted in a widespread Russian hacking campaign.
In September, House Homeland Committee Chairman Mike McCaul (R.-Texas) told CNN that the Republican National Committee had been hacked. Sean Spicer, the RNC spokesman, was quick to tweet that there had been no known breach ""of @gop networks"" and McCaul issued a quick retraction.
McCaul, however, didn't retract his broader assertion that he had been told in classified briefings that the Russian hacking campaign targeted Republicans as well as Democrats.
The Trump transition team responded to the latest reports with an unprecedented public swipe at the U. S. intelligence community.
Related: Trump Was Told Russia to Blame for Hacks Long Before First Debate
""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,"" Trump's representatives said in a statement attributed to the transition team. ""The election ended a long time ago ... It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again.'""
The statement was headlined, ""transition statement on claims of foreign interference in U. S. elections"" and it was released after the Post report was published.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N. Y., said in a statement Saturday that the ""silence from WikiLeaks and others since election day has been deafening."" He added that revelations that Russian hackers worked to help Trump's campaign were ""simultaneously stunning and not surprising.”
""It's imperative that our intelligence community turns over any relevant information so that Congress can conduct a full investigation,"" Schumer said.
Russia has denied being behind the cyber-attacks on Democratic Party institutions. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has denied his organization was being used by the Russian government.
President Barack Obama has ordered U. S. intelligence agencies to deliver to him a dossier of the evidence that the Russian government used cyber-attacks and other means to intervene in the 2016 election, a senior administration official told NBC News.
The information may be made public, the official said.
""Is this the most successful Russian covert action ever?"" asked a former senior intelligence official. ""Yes, it is.""",0

NN, the original 24 hour television news channel, has been working around the clock attempting to spread a narrative about President Donald Trump that he is racist against Latinos and has not been doing enough to help the island of Puerto Rico following the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria.
The liberal-biased news network has been getting as much mileage out of the slanted words of San Juan’s Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who sharply criticized the federal government and mainland Americans for how they are supposedly not helping Puerto Ricans.
Commented Cruz during a CNN appearance, “Well maybe from where she’s standing it’s a good news story. When you’re drinking from a creek, it’s not a good news story. When you don’t have food for a baby, it’s not a good news story. When you have to pull people down from buildings — I’m sorry, that really upsets me and frustrates me.”
CNN’s hosts and commentators have been playing their parts perfectly as well, with so-called Republican Ana Navarro going so far as to say on the network’s show State of the Union, “Look, the President of the United States is the biggest fish in this structure, right? He’s got the biggest bully pulpit of all. And if he wants unity of command, even if he thinks he’s being maligned by the mayor of San Juan, he’s got to shut up!”
She continued disaparaging America’s president in this same coarse way, stating, “And the reason he’s got to shut up is because he is in a gold, inlaid golf course right now while she is wading through water up to her chest. And so if nothing else, the optics look terrible.” Do you think that Ana needs to come out and admit that she is paid to spout liberal talking points?

God Expects You To Be Supernatural
% of readers think this story is Fact.  Add your two cents.
And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?Why do you callmegood?” Jesus replied, “No one is good except God alone.
You are not a good person. I am not a good person. Your best friend is not a good person. Your pastor is not a good person. There is not one good person on the face of the Earth; except for the Lord Jesus Christ, there never has been and never will be. e is none righteous, no, not one
You are a nasty, vindictive, hateful, self-centered and jealous person. So am I. For the serious Christian, every minute of every day is a fight against the sin nature that we are all born with.
When the man said to Jesus, “Good Master,” Jesus asked the man if he intended to address him (Jesus) as God because only God is good.
When we are nasty, vindictive, hateful, self-centered, jealous and/or whatever could be added to this list that is vile, we are just being us — just normal, natural human beings.The closer we are to God in our personal relationship with him, the more we realize how sinful we are. When we are very close to God, we live in a constant state of being ashamed of ourselves.
We often write about “The Great Apostle Paul.” I guarantee you the Apostle Paul seldom, if ever, thought of himself as great. Here is how he felt about himself;“Oh wretched man that I am….” (Romans 7:24)
Yet the Bible orders us to be good, be holy, do right and to live right, think right and speak right. In my own power and limited to my own will these things (qualities) can never happen. I am a captive to my sin nature. That is why I can never be a good or even a decent person. Neither can you!Sin is our only norm. There is no hope for me and there is no hope for you. We must die. That is the only option.
“I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.” The Apostle Paul. (Galatians 2:20)
The pathway of living right is to draw close to God and stay there, allow the Holy Spirit of God to make us ashamed of ourselves and stay there, turn to God in repentance and stay there, ask for and accept God’s forgiveness offered through the Cross of Christ and stay there, begin and/or continue the process of dying and stay there, and live in the power of the resurrection and stay in it. Otherwise, there is no hope for any of us to live above habitual sin that rips at the fabric of our soul and relationships, because sinfulness is natural.
God empowers us (believers in Christ) and expects us to be supernatural as our new normal. No one will do that perfectly all of the time, but we can get better at it with devoted practice. No more excuses, delays or whining. Just do it. Do it because you should. Do it because you can. Do it because if you do not, nothing is going to get better in your life. Be supernatural.
I make no claim that anyone else agrees with me.

"FBI can listen in even if your cell phone is turned off.
Cell phone users beware. The FBI can listen to everything you say, even if your cellphone is turned off. A recent Court ruling in a case against theGenovese crime family revealed that the FBI has the ability, from a remote location, to activate a cell phone and turn it’s microphone into a listening device that transmits to an FBI listening post, a method known as “roving bug”.
Experts say the only way to defeat it is to remove the cell phone battery. “The FBI can access cell phones and modify them remotely without ever having to physically handle them,” James Atkinson, and counterintelligence security consultant told ABC News. “Any recently manufactured cell phone has a built-in tracking device, which can allows eavesdroppers to pinpoint someones location to with in just a few feet”, he added.
According to the recent Court ruling by US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan, “The device functioned whether the phone was powered on or off, intercepting conversation with in its range wherever it happened to be.”
“The courts have given law enforcement a blank check for surveillance,” Richard Rehbock, attorney for defendant John Ardito told ABC News.
“Big Brother is upon us… 1984 happened a long time ago,” he said, referring to the George Orwell futuristic novel “1984”, which describes a society whose members were closely watched by those in power and was published in 1949.

"We are only a few days away from the much-hypedtotal solar eclipse that will occur on August 21.
People within the “path of totality” – a70-mile wide swath of landthat runs from Oregon to South Carolina – will be able to view the rare celestial event.
Tens of millions of people are expectedto travel into the path of totality to view the event at its fullest. If you’re lucky enough to live in the path, you’ll get to see the eclipse in its totality from your own backyard.
About one million people are expected to travel to Oregon to view the eclipse – and it appears that many of them want to add a bonus to the experience: cannabis.
Local news stations are reporting that some Oregon marijuana dispensarieshave seen a spike in salesahead of the solar eclipse, reports Business Insider:
“Tourism already to Oregon, plus an eclipse, is doubling up. And that means customers are doubling in our doors,” Mike Drevecky, an employee at the Little Amsterdam Wellness Center in Portland, Oregon,told The News Review. “I mean, we’re swamped this morning alone.”
A dispensary in the city of John Dayis reportedly turning away recreational customers, in order to have enough productin stock for medical marijuana patients.
In Huntington, pot shop Hotbox Farms isexpecting 10,000 customers or more through the solar eclipse event,according to WVTV Fox 13. The small railway town has a population of about 400.Steven Meland, co-owner ofHotbox Farms (one of two dispensaries in town), said the company’s 21 employees willwork around the clockin orderto meet customer demand.
Marijuana has been legal for recreational use in Oregon since 2015. People over the age of 21 with a valid ID can buy and carry up to an ounce of weed.It’salso legal to give away weed as a gift, so long as it is used in private. Driving under the influence of marijuana is still illegal in the state.
Some dispensaries are offering special eclipse products. Oregon’s Finest, a pot shop in Milwaukie, is selling a variety of marijuana called Moon Puppies. High 5 Tours, a Portland-based marijuana-tourism company, is offering a “Stoner Eclipse Adventure 2017” package that includes transportation from Portland to eastern Oregon, two nights of camping, snacks, and protective glasses.

"Reports are surfacing that Omar Mateen was working with multiple co-ordinated accomplices, pointing to the Orlando shootingbeing an inside job by security agencies, and discrediting the government and mainstream media‘lone wolf’ agenda.
Currently the mainstream media has created a narrative. Omar Mateen acted alone when he shot up the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. This “lone wolf” killed over 50 people and maimed 53. That’s a casualty count of over 100.
Even at close quarters, it takes several rounds to kill a person. People are terrible shots. People who are full of adrenaline and have been running are also terrible shots. Witness interviews also indicate that Mateen shot into the ceiling.
How many rounds of ammo did Mateen have, and would that number be enough to take out over 100 people?
To prove this to be true, according to Mike Cernovitch, we will need to have the following evidence:
* Firearms used (currently rumored to be an AR-15, plus a “handgun”)
* Ballistic report from each victim (how many rounds are in each victim)
The firearms used and expended magazines would tell us how many bullets were fired into Pulse and the victims. We would also need to match the ballistic reports to the firearm used to ensure that no other firearm (and thus shooter) was responsible for the deaths of the victims.
Why isn’t the mainstream media even asking for this basic evidence?
We need a count of all bullets found in Pulse to apply some math. Why? Let’s reason this out.
Assuming the shooter had tactical training, he’d be carrying a load bearing vest with 8 fully loaded 30 round magazines, for a total of 9 magazines (one on his weapon). That’s 270 rounds.
Mateen would also have a fully-loaded pistol with an unknown number of magazines. Let’s assume he was using a 9mm handgun, which holds a 15 round magazine, and that he was carrying 4 additional magazines. That’s 75 rounds of 9mm ammo.
In total, Mateen would have had 345 rounds of ammunition.
If you think 345 rounds of ammo is a lot, talk to some soldiers. People are hard to kill.
Also watch this video. You can hear 30 rounds go off in a matter of seconds. Yet somehow the shooter was killing people for 3 hours?
Talk to any soldier. Even at close ranges, that is not much ammo. According to the official story, Mateen averaged 3.45 rounds per casualty. That sort of sheer killing power would make him the envy of even trained special operations soldiers.
If Mateen had over 345 rounds of ammo, where was he holding it?
Some other questions and objections to consider
Eyewitness accounts are of course suspect, and we must be aware of hoaxes. Yet the media isn’t even asking questions or doing research.
This survivor says he heard the Mateen call someone and say he was the fourth shooter. He also says Mateen claimed to have a female accomplice in the club wearing an explosive vest.
“There were two others that were in the club slaughtering people last night that were not caught” – Eyewitness
This survivor’s testimony corroborates early mainstream media reports of multiple gunmen. Palm Beach Post,a Flordia news outlet, quoted another survivor, Janiel Gonzalez, also claiming there was more than one attacker.
“I’m pretty sure it was more than one person. I heard two guns going at the same time. It was very, very crazy.’
Fifty people were trying to jump over each other trying to exit the place. There was a guy holding the door and not letting us exit. He’s like ‘Stay inside, stay inside.’ As he is saying that, the shooter keeps getting closer and closer and the sound of the bullets is getting closer. Everyone starts to panic. People are getting trampled. Let us out, let us out!’’’
Patron at Orlando nightclub shooting: two gunmen. Heard approx 40 shots. Has no idea how he got blood on shirt@WESH pic.twitter.com/zG2zA8ufVz
Another survivor, Richard Aiken, 29, spoke to the LA Timesand saidthat the gunman claimed he had an explosive vest, that snipers were positioned around the club, and that he had a female accomplice playing dead among the wounded, armed with explosives.
Given the fact Mateen hired a van to travel to the nightclub – when he could have fitted everything he used for the shooting into a car – his claims to have accomplices need to be taken seriously.
Why would the government and media lie?
All of this has been dutifully ignored by the establishment media. It is the job of The New York Times, The Washington Post and the rest of the corporate media to push the Islamic State and lone wolf narrative (and also the anti-gun agenda). This feeds paranoia and hysteria on the part of the public and provides consensus for the surveillance state, the ongoing war on terror abroad, and the police state at home.
Would the government lie, distort the truth, or even plan an event to advance an agenda? All the media are doing is repeating what the government are telling them. This is “journalism.” If you think any thought or analysis has taken place, you are wrong. The media does not ask questions. They do not even know the questions to ask. How many journalists have ever fired a gun?
There is more to the story than the media is reporting.
Mateen’s employer, G4S, has some interesting links to previous terrorist events. They even benefit from terrorism, and transport illegal immigrants into the Unites States.
Mateen worked for the British company G4S since 2007. Throughout that time, G4S has been what people might call a private, special operations military outfit. It is said to be three times the size of the British military. In 2012, a G4S employee was charged with making a bomb threat at the Olympics. Similar bomb threats were connected to G4S in 2013 and just last month.
Previously called WAckenhut,G4S provided security at all three airports affected by the 9/11 attacks. Securicor/G4S had bought Argenbright Security—the 9/11 airport security firm—just nine months before the 9/11 attacks.
The company later ran operations at Guantanamo Bay.
These facts suggest that all aspects of the attack, including initial reports of two suspects in the shootings and that someone was holding the door closed to prevent people from escaping, point to the fact the nightclub shooting was a false flag event operated by security services.
US Attorney Lee Bentley has said the authorities are continuing to investigate the Orlando shooting and are looking for other people who may have been involved.
He said: “We’ve been collecting a great amount of electronic and physical evidence, and there is an ongoing criminal investigation that is still in the early stages.“
Given the connections between Mateen and his employer to terrorism, it is time we start asking the logistical questions that will determine if the Orlando shooting could possibly be the simple lone wolf attack we are being told it was, or if there must be more to the narrative.",1
"Super Mario Odyssey is the latest Nintendo game to fall afoul of social justice warriors.
Nintendo has partially capitulated to the complaints by changing the game’s “controversial” artwork on its cover.
When visuals of the game were released earlier this year, perpetually offended progressives raised their voices in anger at the appearance of Mario in a traditional Mexican outfit, replete with a sombrero and poncho. His stereotypical look prompted cries of “cultural appropriation,” to which Nintendo has responded by removing the offending look from the box art.
Animal rights activists at PETA went after Mario for wearing the raccoon-skinned Tanooki suit with an ultraviolent spoof, alleging that it promoted violence against animals. But the organization quickly explained that they only intended it as a joke.
The same can’t be said of progressives, to whom cultural appropriation is a very real issue — and one that’s prompted numerous colleges to issue warnings against wearing politically incorrect Halloween outfits..
When the box cover for Super Mario Odyssey was unveiled at the Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3) in June, a portion of the cover art showed the portly protagonist dressed up as a Mexican. It was presented alongside other visuals depicting the mustachioed Italian plumber in several different looks and environments, to emphasize the game’s diverse content.
It received complaints from social justice warriors, some of whom proudly identify as “latinx” — a made up word intended to neuter the Spanish language of gendered terminology. In a now deleted tweet, Rebecca C-Palacios wrote: “Hey, it would be nice if we used this stereotype less.” Her words became a meme, prompting her to delete it.
Many Mexican gamers objected to her complaints, stating that they had no problem with the content. Some offered rebuttals to Palacios and others like her to state that they did not need others feeling offended on their behalf, and that they enjoyed recognition from Nintendo.
I am from Mexico and I am honored that Nintendo does this.
Mexican here, chinga tu madre.
Don’t try to speak for us, we Mexicans love this stuff and like seeing our culture in media. Pendeja.
There’s a reason why Mexico got angry when WB censored Speedy Gonzales in Mexico, he is insanly popular here.
The artwork has been altered following complaints. Mexican Mario, while probably still present in the actual game, has been replaced by a visual of him in snorkeling gear, swimming underwater.
One can’t help but wonder why progressives haven’t gone after Mario for being an Italian stereotype.

"The war for the hearts and minds of Americans has been going on for years now. The more information that comes out about the left and the media that’s propping them up, the more lies there are to try and untangle. An industry that was once a beacon for truth and conveyer of information for America to have a little window into what was happening in the nation’s capital and around the world had devolved into just another tool in the hand of those with an agenda.
At this point, it would be foolish to even hope for objective journalism, but we do still hope that the leftist mainstream media is at least known for what they are; a game piece in the hands of the liberal party of socialists and communists. These heartless pawns are so far gone that they even tried to slant the events surrounding the shooting of the Republican representatives on Wednesday control the narrative in favor of the Democrats.
America has finally had enough though, and they’re rallying in the face of American Media’s biggest offender; CNN. Groups of people are coming together to protest CNN and the other providers of fake news to try and at least draw attention to the lies being broadcasts, and hopefully, make them pay in some way.
A protest planned for Saturday at CNN headquarters in Atlanta is gaining steam as protesters rally around President Donald Trump and Republicans following a shooting on Wednesday aimed at GOP lawmakers and staff as they practiced for the annual Congressional baseball game at Nationals Park.
The shooter, an outspoken Bernie Sanders supporter and activist for liberal causes, wounded five people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who remains in critical condition following multiple surgeries.
‘We encourage everyone to keep Rep. Scalise in your prayers for a speedy recovery and the other victims,’ Debbie Dooley of Main Street Patriots, organizer of the rally, told Breitbart News. ‘We will have a moment of silence at the protest to pray for the victims of the leftist assassin.’
The gunman, 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson of Illinois, died from his injuries after Capitol Police on security detail for Scalise engaged him in a gun battle.
Organizers of Saturday’s event say they want to show support not only for President Donald Trump but now for Republicans — like Scalise, a longtime Trump supporter — and speak out against the ‘hate-filled rhetoric’ and fake news from CNN and other media outlets.
‘I am very encouraged by the interest in the CNN fake news protest,’ Dooley told Breitbart News. ‘I’ve noticed a big uptick in the intensity level of folks interested in attending the protest after the cowardly assassination attempt of Republican Congressmen by someone on the radical left in Alexandria, Virginia on Wednesday.’
Dooley said she is not concerned about the safety of protesters.
‘One big reason is that Georgia is an open carry state and violent thugs would be insane to attempt violence at our peaceful protest,’ Dooley said.
‘This hate filled rhetoric against President Trump has permeated many media outlets like CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times,’ Dooley said. ‘Some of CNN’s hosts engage in hate-filled hysteria in their attempt to bring down the democratically-elected President of the United States.’
‘They helped create the toxic atmosphere that Hodgkinson would believe it is ‘open season’ on Republicans,’ Dooley said. ‘It is time for Trump supporters to rise up and say with a loud voice, enough.’
Bikers for Trump 2020 will also take part in the protest.
‘Bikers for Trump will be at CNN headquarters on Saturday because in our opinion there is no way to measure this level of journalistic malpractice,’ Founder Chris Cox told Breitbart News. ‘CNN exemplifies vigilante journalism.’
Tim Selaty, president of Citizens for Trump, will also bring supporters to Saturday’s rally.
‘We the American citizenry, who dutifully elected Donald J. Trump as our president, are completely fed up and disgusted with CNN and other liberal media outlets continually launching malicious fabricated propaganda (aka fake news) attacks on our P. O.T.U.S.,’Selaty told Breitbart News. He went on:
We believe this fake news media movement to destroy our president is not only hurting the credibility of mainstream media and undermining our election process but is equally impacting our American society in a very negative way as we’ve seen by the recent attack in Virginia on our elected Republican officials.
We demand that CNN and all media outlets have ethics and truth in their reporting or we will continue to mass protest at their headquarters and express our discontent with their sponsors. We ask all of our fellow patriots to stand with us this Saturday at CNN’s headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia and send a clear message to CNN and all other media outlets guilty of spreading unsubstantiated stories to hurt our president and fellow Americans.
The idea that all of the liberal propaganda could have been a huge part of what caused the horrible shooting spree of this liberal extremist is terrible to think of. The odd part is that Hodgkinson saw the whole Republican party and President Trump’s policies as synonymous.Republicans saw a difference between Trump and the other lifetime political candidates that ran against him, that’s why he won the primary. The left, however, seems to just see one big blob of deplorable objections. If anything this shooting has made America rally behind the Republicans even more.
The shooter can rest in peace knowing that his actions were actually a huge setback to his cause. Even his hero, Bernie Sanders denies him in his death.
You liberals just thought wewere ticked off when we elected Trump; you ain’t seen nothing yet.
Share if you’re ready to see an end of the liberal fake news!

"How much you trust the mainstream media?
Most of the people think that the media follows an establishment agenda and tries to influence the way they think by showing what is not real and true.
Mainstream media (MSM) is a term and abbreviation used to refer collectively to the various large mass news media that influence a large number of people, and both reflect and shape prevailing currents of thought. The term is used to contrast with alternative media which may contain content with more dissenting thought as they do not reflect prevailing opinion.
The term is often used for large news conglomerates, including newspapers and broadcast media, that underwent successive mergers in many countries. The concentration of media ownership has raised concerns of a homogenization of viewpoints presented to news consumers. Consequently, the term mainstream media has been widely used in conversation and the blogosphere, often in oppositional, pejorative, or dismissive senses, in discussion of the mass media and media bias.
According to philosopher Noam Chomsky, media organizations with an elite audience such as CBS News and The New York Times, successful corporations with the assets necessary to engage in original reporting, set the tone for other smaller news organizations which lack resources by creating conversations that cascade down to smaller news organizations using the Associated Press and other means of aggregation. An elite mainstream sets the agenda and smaller organizations parrot it.

"Going to a concert should be a fun time for anyone. For one night you are able to cut loose and listen to the music you love with others. Which is what concert goers in Manchester, England thought on Monday night. Sadly, though what should have been a fun night instantly turned into tragedy, but who is being pegged for it is no surprise.
There are at least 19 people have been confirmed dead and around 50 people injured in a bombing that British authorities are treating as a terror attack. The attackoccurred towards the end of anAriana Grande concert in Manchester, England on Monday night.
The Britishpolice said that the explosion happened around the foyer of the Manchester Arena at 10:30 p.m., around the time the concert finished. However, there are many reports from eyewitnesses that said they heard two blasts, but that has not been confirmed as of yet.
Here is more Fox News:
Witnesses described panic as concertgoers rushed to get out of the arena.Video from inside the arena showed people screaming as they made their way out amid a sea of pink balloons. Some on social media initially suggested that some of the balloons had burst, making a loud noise like a bomb.
Concertgoer Sasina Akhtar told the Manchester Evening News that Grande had just finished her last song when “there was an explosion behind us at the back of the arena. We saw young girls with blood on them, everyone was screaming and people were running. There was lots of smoke.”
David Richardson, who attended the show with his 13-year-old daughter, told the MEN that he heard two explosions just after the show.
“It was about 40 feet behind us near one of the exits. We just thought it was people messing about then it happened again. Another explosion sounded.Then we saw the smoke. Everyone just fled.”
Majid Khan, 22, said she heard a “huge bomb-like bang that hugely panicked everyone and we were all trying to flee the arena.”
“Everyone was in a huge state of panic, calling each other as some had gone to the toilet whilst this had gone off, so it was just extremely disturbing for everyone there.”
Another witness, Oliver Jones, 17, told Sky News he was in the bathroom when he heard “a loud bang.”
“The bang echoed around the foyer of the arena and people started to run,” Jones said. “I (saw) people running and screaming towards one direction and then many were turning around to run back the other way. Security was running out as well as the fans and concert goers.”
Manchester Victoria station, which is under the arena, was also evacuated and all trains were canceled, though there were no initial reports of injuries there.
Stranded concertgoers reportedly were waiting for rides home in nearby bars and hotels. Sky News reported that some city taxi drivers were offering free rides to help clear traffic out of the city center.
The Dangerous Woman Tour is the third concert tour by Grande to support her third studio album, Dangerous Woman.From Manchester the tour was to move through Europe, including Belgium, Poland, Germany, Switzerland and France, through the summer with stops in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Costa Rica, Mexico and on to Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, New Zealand, Australia and more.
EXPLOSION AT MANCHESTER ARENA AND EVERYONE RAN OUT SO SCARY pic.twitter.com/pJbUBoELtE
I never ment to record this but this is me leaving ariana grande #DangerousWomantour #ManchesterArena hope everyone is safe and got out pic.twitter.com/TLu73UBl0x
Ambulances out in force heading to Manchester Arena after all lining up on Thompson street fire station. pic.twitter.com/vpAFFUG0MI
Sadly, this is what I thought would happen in Europe considering their open border policy. At this time, it is not confirmed that this is definitely a terror attack, but if I were a betting woman I am sure it was. These terrorists will not stop with these attacks until other countries around the world begin to fight back.
That is exactly why we need to close our borders and initiate a tougher vetting process. However, as we know liberals will continue to fight that no matter how many Americans are hurt in the process. I can only hope that this will open the eyes of the people in Europe and they will demand tougher borders.
I pray for all those who lost a loved one in this blast and that they are able to find peace and comfort in this horrific tragedy. I also hope that the police are able to find these scum bags that caused this and prosecute them fully.

In the world of TV news, few have had a fall from grace quite like Megyn Kelly.
Sure, anchors such as Dan Rather have seen their careers come to an abrupt end after embarrassing flops, but Kelly’s different. For her, the fall from stardom has been a long and drawn out affair. As of now, it’s hard to tell when she’ll hit bottom.
Kelly’s tumble started with the 2016 election. During the Republican primary, her intense scrutiny of Donald Trump drew heavy criticism. From there, Trump vowed to skip any debate that Kelly moderated, a promise he kept.
At that point, Kelly had fallen out of favor with the right-leaning audience at Fox News. However, her harsh stance on Trump gained her the admiration of liberals across the country, and as a result she split with Fox and took her act to the more liberal NBC.
Of course, if Kelly thought her troubles were over then, she was sorely mistaken.
Her debut at NBC was marred by multiple on-air flubs — which followed a major contractual dispute. To make matters worse, her ratings tumbled so fast that NBC cut the run of her Sunday show.
At this point, it seems as if the only thing that may save Kelly’s run at NBC is her much-anticipated morning show. However, as the debut of that show nears, reports indicate that officials at NBC are in a panic over its prospects.
The Daily Beast reports:
Four weeks before the Sept. 25 debut of Megyn Kelly Today … some NBC insiders are expressing doubts, and even worries, about the network news division’s plan to scrap a reliable, long-running program in order to morph the former Fox News anchor and Donald Trump nemesis into an accessible, female-friendly personality for an ethnically diverse daytime viewership.
Some network insiders speculate her personality isn’t a fit for daytime televison:
Yet, according to network insiders, her new role is prompting “questions internally about who her audience is exactly” as well as a sense of “total panic” concerning the intense media scrutiny that will unavoidably attend the launch of Megyn Kelly Today.
Just a few months into her career change, Kelly can’t afford another ratings bust. Despite the public optimism for her new show, it seems NBC officials are quietly expressing concern that precisely such a disaster might be about to happen.
In four weeks, we’ll see if the stunning fall continues.

"Indonesian Food Blogger: The Unifying Power Of Cuisine And Social Media : The Salt   The diverse Southeast Asian country has more than 17,000 islands, a median age of 29 and an expansive fare influenced by many cultures. And the tech-savvy population is reaching out to the world.
Indonesian Food Blogger: The Unifying Power Of Cuisine And Social Media
Indonesian Food Blogger: The Unifying Power Of Cuisine And Social Media
What's On Your Plate
Indonesian Food Blogger: The Unifying Power Of Cuisine And Social Media
Indonesia is the world's fourth-largest country. And its population is young. The median age is in the late 20s. In the U. S. and China it's in the late 30s. So in some ways, you could say that young Indonesians are the future of the world. This week, we've been looking at the threads that tie this country together. And for young Indonesians, one of those threads is social media. In Jakarta, I met a 29-year-old food blogger and Instagrammer (ph) at an outdoor food court with dozens of hawkers selling dishes from all over the country. My first question was about his name, which it turns out is also food-related.
PRAWNCHE NGADITOWO: Actually, it's prawn and che. Prawnche.
SHAPIRO: Is that a common Indonesian name?
NGADITOWO: No. My dad, he was doing business in the prawn industries. And I was named (laughter) - I was named after the industry.
SHAPIRO: Wow. Your father was, like, a shrimp farmer, a prawn farmer...
SHAPIRO: ...And so he named you Prawnche?
NGADITOWO: Yes. I was just grateful that it's not Shrimpche, right?
SHAPIRO: Prawnche Ngaditowo grew up in a city called Medan. His family is of Chinese descent. In 2006, he moved a thousand miles away from his family to the capital city, Jakarta. That's where he began to explore the variety Indonesia has to offer through its food. By day, he works in advertising.
NGADITOWO: At the weekend usually I explore food. I also get to eat a lot. And I write about it.
SHAPIRO: You don't look like a person who eats a lot.
SHAPIRO: So in the stuff that you write about on your blog and on your Instagram account you are talking about what it means to be Indonesian and all these different foods from all over. But also, by writing in English, you're doing something a little broader even than just Indonesia.
NGADITOWO: Yes. I thought, why not, you know, use English to introduce all our food? And people can read about it and, you know, maybe decide to visit Indonesia somehow. Do you ever try fish meatballs?
NGADITOWO: Yeah, this just kind of like that, but just drier. No soup, just peanut sauce. You should try one. Yes.
SHAPIRO: Yeah, it smells leafy from the banana leaf, and also from the grill there's a little smokiness.
SHAPIRO: It's shaped almost like a Tootsie Roll.
NGADITOWO: Oh, yeah. You can say that, too.
SHAPIRO: Indonesia is a country where half the population is below the age of 30. And so I wonder how you view your future.
NGADITOWO: If you ask me about my generation and my father's generation, my dad has no luxury in finding creativity. I mean, he just worked just to let us live.
SHAPIRO: When you say your father just worked to pay the bills, are you saying that your parents' generation would never understand spending all of your time and energy photographing food for an Instagram account?
NGADITOWO: Yes. My dad used to be very skeptical about it. Why are you doing this? You are not making money. You are not doing good things. But as time passes by, my dad's starting to see what I do - what I try to do, actually. And now he's starting to see the good side.
SHAPIRO: Is there one food in particular here that reminds you of your childhood?
NGADITOWO: Oh, of course. The one - soto medan...
NGADITOWO: It's coconut milk-based, so it's kind of thick with a lot of coriander and a lot of stuff like that. And it feels - especially right now it's raining, right? - so it's really good for this moment.
SHAPIRO: Yeah, seems like a really good time to eat this.
SHAPIRO: Should we try some?
NGADITOWO: Yes, we should.
SHAPIRO: Is soto medan something you can make at home, or is it too complicated?
NGADITOWO: My mom is very good at it. I think that actually my mom made better (laughter), so...
SHAPIRO: Everyone thinks their mom makes it better.
NGADITOWO: Yeah. Yeah. Of course, right? I mean - (laughter).
SHAPIRO: I know that sometimes in Indonesia people of Chinese descent are treated as...
NGADITOWO: Yes. Yes. Being a minority here, yeah, it's kind of like a stereotype thing. They thought that, oh, you Chinese? You stingy. Oh, you Chinese? You just want all the money. And that happen.
SHAPIRO: Social media has obviously been a very powerful tool for you to build bridges and connections...
SHAPIRO: And social media is also being used as a tool to exploit the differences that are inherent in diversity.
SHAPIRO: Is that something that you've seen, too?
NGADITOWO: Yes, obviously, because I use social media, like, a lot. And then I actually experience a lot of positive things, too. But, yeah, I can't deny it. A lot negative things happen from that, too.
SHAPIRO: So to be able to come to a food court like this and sit at a table with food from Java and Sumatra and eastern Indonesia and western Indonesia, like, this is the dream.
NGADITOWO: Yes. Yes. This is the dream. I just hope people can do that all the time, you know, sit together and eat a lot and laugh together. I just hope that happen.
That's food blogger and Instagrammer Prawnche Ngaditowo. You can find him online with the handle foodventurer.

"() Dramatic events continue unfolding here in the United States and around the world. From the continuing political unrest on the home front to the worldwide tensions of nuclear threats of deadly confrontations across many nations, the situations keep escalating.
Now Mother Nature is showing her hand, with hurricane Harvey which slammed into Texas, wildfires in California and the Pacific Northwest, along with the new threat from category 5 hurricane Irma, expected to breach our southern shores in a matter of days.
Censorship in the extreme is leading to violent efforts by individuals to silence those who have views which differ from theirs, often leading to the crushing of truth and the facts, leaving only slanted and misquoted information behind.
Every day, the stranglehold of censorship tightens, eroding away the freedom of speech we have always enjoyed, and if allowed to continue on its current path, soon freedom of speech will become only a memory.
It is time for We the People to make our voices heard, to spread the truth far and wide. You can be an important part of the movement to save free speech.

"Fox News’ Neil Cavuto has just called out CNN. He launched a tirade that will have CNN questioning itself for some time to come. The MSM in general has taken to openly criticizing the President regardless of his action; in fact, a recent Harvard study feud that 89% of the media’s coverage of Donald Trump was “actively negative”.
Now that Trump has started hitting back at them over Fake News, they’re on the ropes and trying to justify their existence. Cavuto is not taking any prisoners here, in the video he talks about how they must be feeling now that the shoe is on the other foot.
The US used to have a media that could maintain an element of fairness, but since becoming complicit in trying to elect Hillary Clinton, they have not only lost all credibility, but they have ostracized themselves from half the country.
Viewers can no longer rely on the truth coming out from the media, so they are turning to alternative news sources. They are losing viewers at an unprecedented rate and will continue to do so until they admit their mistakes and try and earn back their integrity.",1
"Lesley Stahl is one of America's most honored and experienced broadcast journalists. Her rich career has been marked by political scoops, surprising features and award-winning foreign reporting, a body of work that won her the RTDNA's 2015 Paul White award for lifetime achievement. She has been a 60 Minutes correspondent since March 1991 and begins her 26th season on the broadcast in September. She is the author of the best-selling book ""Becoming Grandma.""
Stahl landed the first post-election television interview with Donald Trump in November 2016. She followed this up with an interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu on how one of America's crucial allies would work with the new administration. She earned her 12th Emmy for a shocking 2015 report on how some police recruit vulnerable young people for dangerous jobs as confidential informants. Her interview with the widow of a slain hostage offered a rare look inside the technically illegal process of negotiating with terrorists.
In 2013, Stahl gained unprecedented access to the U. S.'s Guantanamo Bay prison facilities for a two-part series honored with an Edward R. Murrow award. In 2014, she won two Emmys, one for the Guantanamo series and another for an eye-opening story about China's huge real estate bubble. Later in 2014, she was honored by the International Center For Journalists with its Founders Award for Journalistic Excellence.
Her uplifting feature, ""Gospel for Teens,"" was recognized with two Emmy Awards in 2012.
That same year, her whistleblower interview with F-22 Raptor pilots provided the first public personal accounts of the fighter's oxygen system troubles, spurring the Secretary of Defense to take action.  Stahl's interview of a former CIA Clandestine Services chief about the use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" on al Qaeda operatives sparked a national debate.
Stahl's two reports from the Middle East in the fall of 2010, ""Unfinished Business,"" about Iraq, and ""City of David,"" about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, were honored by the Overseas Press Club for Best Interpretation on International Affairs. Her reporting on the life of a young, musical savant won her an Edward R. Murrow award for feature reporting for her 2008 follow-up on Rex Lewis-Clack.
Her interviews with the families of the Duke lacrosse players exonerated in a racial rape case and with Nancy Pelosi before she became the first woman to become speaker of the House were big scoops for 60 Minutes and CBS News in 2007.  Her other exclusive 60 Minutes interviews with former Bush administration officials Paul O'Neill and Richard Clarke ranked among the biggest news stories of 2004.  In a December 2002 interview with Al Gore, Stahl was the first to report that he would not run for president.
Prior to joining 60 Minutes, Stahl served as CBS News White House correspondent during the Carter and Reagan presidencies and part of the term of George H. W. Bush.  Her reports appeared frequently on the CBS Evening News, first with Walter Cronkite, then with Dan Rather, and on other CBS News broadcasts.
During much of that time, she also served as moderator of Face the Nation, CBS News' Sunday public-affairs broadcast (September 1983-May 1991).  For Face the Nation, she interviewed such newsmakers as Margaret Thatcher, Boris Yeltsin, Yasir Arafat and virtually every top U. S. official, including George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle.
She was co-host with Charles Kuralt of  ""America Tonight,"" a daily CBS News late-night broadcast of interviews and essays (Oct. 90-March 91).
Her experiences covering Washington for more than 20 years became the subject of her book Reporting Live (Simon & Schuster, 1999).  The stories she has covered since joining CBS News in the Washington bureau in 1972 range from Watergate through the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan to the 1991 Gulf War.  She has reported on U. S.-Russian summit meetings and the economic summits of the industrialized countries, and the national political conventions and election nights throughout her career.
Stahl anchored several CBS News documentaries, including ""The Politics of Cancer"" and ""In the Red Blues,"" about the budget deficit, both for ""CBS Reports.""
Other Emmy winners include a Lifetime Achievement Emmy received in September 2003 and her first Emmy, won for reporting on a bombing in Beirut for the CBS Evening News in 1983. Her Face The Nation interview with Sen. John Tower won Stahl her second statuette.  Her 60 Minutes reports ""How He Won the War,"" about former FDA Commissioner David Kessler's battle with the tobacco industry, and ""Punishing Saddam,"" which exposed the plight of Iraqi citizens, mostly children, suffering the effects of the United Nations sanctions against Iraq, were both Emmy winners.  ""Punishing Saddam"" also won Stahl electronic journalism's highest honor, an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Silver Baton.  Her profile of search engine giant Google earned her a 2005 Business and Financial Emmy award, and her timely 2006 interview of ex-Hewlett-Packard Chairwoman Patricia Dunn won an Emmy for coverage of a breaking news story.
In 1996, Stahl was awarded the Fred Friendly First Amendment Award, given by Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn., in recognition of her journalistic achievements.  She was also honored that year by the Radio/Television News Directors Association (RTNDA) with an Edward R. Murrow Award for Overall Excellence in Television for her 60 Minutes report on the Michigan Militia.  In 1990, she was honored with the Dennis Kauff Journalism Award for lifetime achievement in the news profession.
Stahl was born Dec. 16, 1941, in Swampscott, Mass., and was graduated cum laude in 1963 from Wheaton College, where she served on the board of trustees. She currently serves on the board of the New York City Ballet.  She and her husband, author Aaron Latham, live in New York.  They have a daughter, Taylor.",0
"Three people have been jailed in China after they were caught smuggling thousands of dead butterflies into the country, state media report.
Authorities discovered a haul of colourful butterflies in early 2016 when they opened packages that were supposed to contain clothing.
They were bought online and posted to China to be framed and sold.
The group were given five, seven and 10-year sentences, the official Xinhua news agency reports.
They were also fined by the court in Jinan, eastern Shandong province. Many of the butterflies were rare or protected species.
It is believed to be the largest butterfly smuggling case uncovered by Chinese authorities.
The trio bought 2,800 specimens from Malaysia and the Philippines. One of the most prized species on the private market is the Papilio Chikae, or Luzon peacock swallowtail.
Chinese private collectors are prepared to pay more than 10,000 yuan (1,150; $1,500) for just one specimen.
Almost half of the butterflies found are protected species under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites), Xinhua says.
China has given tough sentences in the past to people convicted of illegal wildlife trading.
In 2015, a university student was given 10 years for selling rare falcons he found near his home to friends.
At the time, many Chinese social media users expressed shock that he was given a longer sentence than others convicted of crimes like rape or drunk-driving.
In this case, several users of microblogging platform Weibo said the sentences given were too long.
One said that because the butterflies were dead ""there was no trading and no harm"".
But others backed the sentence, which they believed was appropriate.",0
"In wake of the controversial 2016 presidential election, President Obama has signed what may be one of his final executive orders. On Monday morning, President Obama signed Executive Order 13749 banning all fake news websites and ensuring penalties ranging from fines/fees to criminal prosecution for those that own and maintain such websites.
In the days after President-Elect Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election the topic of fake news has been one of fierce controversy as many point to a myriad of frequently trending- yet fake news articles that were widely circulated on social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter during the election cycle. According to many critics, the rate in which fake news was circulated online unfairly influenced the results of the election.
President Obama previously indicated that he agrees with the majority of the public that fake news has a negative effect on U. S. society. He recently addressed the topic of fake news during a speech in Berlin by saying – “Because in an age where there’s so much active misinformation, and its packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television, where some overzealousness on part of a U.S. official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect. We won’t know what to fight for. And we lose so much of what we’ve gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we’ve come to take for granted.”
According to multiple sources, the fake news article that was the apparent “last straw” leading-up to President Obama’s decision to sign Executive Order 13749 was an article run on a fake news website with the misleading domain – www.thebostontribune.com.co. The website was designed to trick readers into thinking that they were reading information from our publication (The Boston Tribune), however – the almost unnoticeable distinction between our website and this fake website was the ‘.co’ added to the end of the domain. When we first learned of the copycat website spreading fake news we contacted the publisher of the misleading website (later identified at Aaron Baker) and asked that the website be taken down immediately – Mr. Baker failed to respond to our request.
The article published by the fake news website is one that many will recognize as it spread rapidly on Facebook and quickly received over 300,000 shares. It featured the headline – “Unmotivated Voters Paid $50 To Cast Democratic Vote”. The premise of the misleading and fake news article was that “unmotivated voters” had been paid $50 to vote for the democratic candidate – Hillary Clinton. The fake news article implied voter fraud and questioned the claim that Presidential Candidate Clinton actually won the popular vote. The fake news article contained images of a fake Craigslist post offering individuals that intended to stay home on election night $50 if the voted for Clinton. According to the fake listing – all the voter had to do was take a picture of their ballot post-vote (as proof) to receive the $50. The website has since been removed, however, we were able to capture a screenshot of the fake Craigslist post and have included it below.
According to government officials, these types of fake news articles are extremely dangerous when spread at a high rate throughout an uneducated public. Obama representative, Douglas Carter, told reporters at a brief press-conference this morning that the decision to ban fake news outlets would result in a huge win for the general public. According to Carter, “The intentionally false information spread by these outlets for profit extends past the publisher’s right of free speech and more closely aligns with dangerous propaganda – and we have laws for that.”
When asked if purveyors of intentionally fake news such as Aaron Baker (the publisher of www.thebostontrinune.com.co) could face legal consequences for their previous actions, Carter told reporters – “That is certainly something that we are looking at. The penalties for intentionally spreading dangerous propaganda can range from costly monetary fines up to 5 years in a federal prison – we recommend all publishers of intentionally fake news close shop immediately.”
It’s currently unclear what processes will be implemented to determine what constitutes as fake news and what Executive Order 13749 will have on alt-right news sources such as Breitbart and InfoWars.",1
"“Note from Robert Spencer: When Serkan Engin sent me this piece and asked me to publish it, I asked him if this could endanger him in Turkey. He responded, “I am ready to die.” I certainly hope that he encounters no difficulty as a result of making these public statements; what happens to him now will be a test of the health of the freedom of speech and Kemalist secularism in rapidly re-Islamizing Turkey. It is certainly not possible to say such things in the U. S. today without charges of “racism” and “bigotry,” without any discussion of whether there are Islamic texts and teachings that justify violence and hatred: the question cannot even be asked.
It should also be noted that I do not agree with Serkan Engin’s call for Islam to be outlawed. In the U. S., at least (to say nothing of Turkey or elsewhere), we do not outlaw ideas, and do not employ Thought Police. The criminalizing of thought is a hallmark of the totalitarian state. Even at the height of the Cold War, Communism was not outlawed. Once a people grants to the government the power to declare certain ideas illegal, that power can be turned against good ideas, to the detriment of the people. What needs to be done in response to jihad violence and Islamic supremacism today is an aggressive prosecution of any and all actions dedicated to subverting the republic; that is, however, not being done.
In any case, I may not agree with everything Serkan Engin says, but I will defend to the death his right to speak his mind. That is the fundamental principle of the freedom of speech, and the indispensable foundation of any free society. It is rapidly being lost.”
I am an atheist author and poet, who had lived as a Sunni Muslim for 23 years from birth, and I am still living in a Muslim country, Turkey. Also, my parents and all of my relatives are still Muslim. So, my critics about Islam can be easily consider this an inside view.
I know that the title of this essay seems assertive, but I will explain the rightness of this title step-by-step in this essay.
First of all, you have to learn about Islam that if you are an “outsider”, a non-Muslim, for example, a Christian, an atheist, a Buddhist, a Jew or whatever else, all Muslims have the “right” of killing and raping you, grabbing all your properties, your country, land, money and anything else. They take this “right” from the book of their belief, the Quran. In other words, they take this “right” from their belief’s core, the theology of Islam.
Here are some examples of this in verses from Quran.
This verse of Quran is about “all non-Muslims”, all “heretics”! — Christians, Buddhists, atheists, Jews, etc. — describing them “who wage war against Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad)”
“Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.”
And this verse of the Quran is about the order to kill the humans who left Islam, the apostates:
“They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper.”
Look at the current situation in Syria. How can Islamist terrorists slaughter Alawite people or rape Christian women so easily? Because they take this “right” from their belief and they believe that they will go to the heaven because of these vandalistic actions against “outsiders”, who are out of Islam, who don’t believe the same religious tenets — in other words, those who are the “heretics” according to their belief. Some Muslims say, “But they are not the real Muslims.” That is a big lie; that is the exact form of real Islam, because these vandalistic actions are in accord with the orders of Quran.
You have heard many times that “Islam is a tolerant religion”. That is the biggest lie that you can hear all over the World, and this lie is used as a mask to hide the terrible face of Islam. There is NO difference between Islam and Islamism. This is the main error that the modern world make about Islam. There are not different forms as Islam and Islamism, they are the same thing, and they have the same content. This separation is just only an illusion, and it is used by Muslims to hide the brutal, hateful, oppressive,murderous, genocidal face of Islam.
Islamic theology is based on the verses of the Quran and Hadith. Hadiths are the words and actions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and all Muslims must follow these words and actions in addition to the orders of Quran. For example, you have to defecate as Muhammad did, and you have to clean yourself as he did, or you can rape and enslave a “heretic” woman in a war as a sex slave as Muhammad did, or you can torture your enemy in a war to learn the place of his hidden money, as Muhammad did.
You “must” cut the hand of a thief as Muhammad did, not give him any prison sentence as do the modern laws.
You must stone a woman to death as Muhammad did, because she had sex outside of the rules of Islam (but you must only whip her partner a hundred times). If you are a Muslim, you can never set them free while considering that their sexual actions are about their own personal relations and freedom, in accord with modern laws. You must definitely apply the punishments of Muhammad such as stoning the woman to the death and whipping her partner a hundred times if you want to be a good Muslim.
You must kill the man who left the belief of Islam, as Muhammad did. You can’t say “This is his own choice and he has the freedom of thought and belief”, because it is an order of the Quran that you “must” kill the persons who were Muslim before and then left the Islamic religion.
You must kill all homosexuals according to the orders of Islam. No Muslims can say according to Islam that their sexual orientation is their own natural right, in accord with the human rights norms of our age.
You have the “right” to marry a little girl at 9 years old, as Muhammad did. In other words, you can rape a little child legally in Islam and make her a sex slave, and also a domestic slave till the end of her life.
You can lie alongside of your dead wife for 6 hours, as Muhammad did. In other words, you can rape the dead body of your wife for 6 hours after her death.
Here is Islam…Here is the “tolerant religion”…Here is the right way to the heaven…Here are the orders of Allah…Here are the actions of Muhammad…
You can easily see how civilized the Muslim countries of the world are because of Islam, such as Afghanistan, Nigeria, Turkey, Iran, Sudan and the others. You can see how much they have contributed to the history of philosophy, the history of art, and the history of science of the whole world. You can see how respectful they are to human rights, women’s rights, children’s rights, the freedom of expression and thought, the freedom of the press, the freedom of belief, etc.
The first genocide wave of 20th century, the Armenian Genocide, the Assyrian Genocide and the Pontic Greek Genocide, was perpetrated by Turkish and Kurdish people of the Ottoman Empire and the new Turkish Republic, getting motivation from the “rights” that they had because of Islam: the “rights” of killing and raping the non-Muslims, enslaving their women and little girls as sex slaves and also domestic slaves, and grabbing their money, houses and lands. However, “The Committee of Union and Progress” (CUP) (Turkish: ttihat ve Terakki Cemiyeti) was based on Turkish nationalism; they used Turkish and Kurdish people easily for these genocides because of the Islamic religion’s content about non-Muslims. All the Turkish and Kurdish Muslims believed that they would go to the heaven if they killed more non-Muslims, as do today’s Islamist terrorists.
The owners of the second genocide wave of 20th century were Nazis, as you know. They took the genocides of the Turks as a sample. It is know that Adolf Hitler said to his military commanders, “Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?,” while they were talking about the reaction of the world about the genocides that they were planning to perpetrate.
Nazism was considered a legal and respectable ideology at the beginning of the 1930s, and then the world saw how dangerous Nazism was. Millions of people died because of Nazism, and today it is illegal to support Nazism in any civilized country. You can never make propaganda about Nazism legally. Today, Nazism is not considered as a genuine thought alternative, and it is not included in the freedom of thought and expression.
As I have detailed above, Islam is against the human rights norms of our age, and it has more dangerous content than Nazism. Islam is not a belief alternative, it is just a crime against humanity, and any crime shouldn’t have freedom in our modern world. So, Islam must be declared illegal all over the world, as is Nazism, because of its vandal content and commands that are against human rights. All actions about Islam must be forbidden and the propagandists of Islam must be judged because of instigating to the crimes of murder, rape, grab and crimes against humanity. Otherwise, the world will meet with a big tragedy when the Islamists will get more power, as the world suffered because of Nazism.

"When Greta Van Susteren goes to work at her new broadcast home of MSNBC, the elevator takes her past the place, three floors below, where she worked for 14 years: Fox News.
And while she still enjoys seeing her old colleagues in the hallways and expresses no regrets — “None. Zero. None” — about leaving, she does have a request for her former employer and television in general: More women in prime time.
“I’m a real feminist, so I like to see women on the air,” Van Susteren said in an interview this week from her office just down the hall from her new studio with sweeping views of the Capitol. ""Fox is going to have to do its own programming. But I will say, I like to see women on the air.”
In addition to Van Susteren, Fox News lost two other high-profile female anchors over the past year: Prime-time star Megyn Kelly, who joined Van Susteren in the NBC family last month, and Gretchen Carlson, who helped bring about the downfall of former Fox News chief Roger Ailes after filing an explosive sexual harassment lawsuit over the summer. Fox News ultimately replaced Van Susteren’s 7 p.m. hour with a temporary show about the first 100 days hosted by Martha MacCallum, making her the network's only female anchor during the evening hours — but a news anchor, not opinion like the three men whose shows follow hers. CNN’s lineup also only features one female anchor in the evening, Erin Burnett’s “Outfront” at 7 p.m. MSNBC features Van Susteren at 6 p.m. and Rachel Maddow at 9 p.m.
“I don’t think someone should be on the air just because she’s a woman, don’t get me wrong, I’m very much interested in fairness,” Van Susteren said, noting that when she came up through school and started as a lawyer, there weren’t many women in the professional class. “I’m just saying I’d like to see that but I don’t think it’s a deal breaker.”
Van Susteren abruptly left Fox News in September over what’s been described as tense contract renegotiations that went south in the wake of Ailes’ departure. Van Susteren refused to talk about what led to her departure from Fox, saying only that ""I'm looking forward.""
Fox News declined to comment about Van Susteren's departure or questions about its number of women anchors in prime time.
After four months off traveling the globe with her husband, Van Susteren joined MSNBC in January after what she said was a quick decision. “They had a hole in their lineup,” she said in explaining what prompted her to join the network.
That made her one of the few anchors who have completed the cable news hat trick, working for all three networks a rare feat also coincidentally accomplished by one of her Fox News replacements, Tucker Carlson. And though Van Susteren insisted in an interview nothing has changed other than the dial and the logo, she said that she is reenergized.
“I'm having more fun because it's an adventure, it’s something new,” she said. ""At Fox, I had been there for so long, it was almost like you phone it in after a while, there was no challenge to it after a while.""
Van Susteren said she’s still the same broadcaster, even bringing on three of her staffers from Fox (two have already joined, one is joining in the next few weeks she said) and two contributors for her legal panel, though she acknowledged that some of her old Fox fans are aghast at her having joined what they perceive as a liberal network.
“I’m the same. I’m absolutely the same. I even have my same desk!” she exclaimed, pointing to a huge wrap around desk in her office which can be moved up or down at the push of a button in her otherwise small office. ""I’m still the same. I’ve got a lot of the same employees and I still have the same enthusiasm for the job.”
She said she’s even hoping to reunite with a former regular guest of hers, President Donald Trump. But Van Susteren hasn’t asked for an interview yet, she said, holding her cards for when she really wants him — his first foreign trip which she suspects will be to Israel.
“He promised me his first foreign trip, this was long before he was president,” she said, noting the promise came during small talk before a sitdown interview. ""So I would like to do his first foreign trip.”
Despite their long history, Trump doesn’t call Van Susteren like he does other cable news hosts. But Van Susteren said she prefers it that way.
“I’ve never been in any of these secret phone calls. … I don’t want it. Not that I’m opposed to sourcing or anything, I just feel uncomfortable about it,” she said. ""I like everything out in the open.”
In her new studio, Van Susteren blasts music during commercial breaks — The Rolling Stones, The Turtles, Michael Jackson, Creedance Clearwater Revival — something she said she started at MSNBC simply because “it’s fun.”
And the timing of her return to television has given her more occasion to revisit her roots as a legal commentator, a role she played on CNN during the O. J. Simpson trial in 1995. For example on Monday, Van Susteren’s 6 p.m. show happened to be airing just as the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco announced it would hold a hearing the next day on Trump's travel ban.
At one point during the breaks, a clearly energized Van Susteren expressed with delight that her guests, who included law professor Alan Dershowitz and former Russian Amb. Michael McFaul, actually “knew something” and began explaining to her executive producer how the circuit court of appeals works and what the next step would be, even suggesting NBC’s general counsel file some sort of petition to ensure there would be audio of the hearing.
Aside from the legal tangles the administration has found itself in, Van Susteren insists she’s keeping an eye on all of Trump’s promises and how much they cost.
""The wall costs money, extreme vetting costs money … he’s got to get that money from Capitol Hill and while he’s being cheered by his base, in order to fulfill it he’s got to get to Capitol Hill and I think that’s where he’ll have problems,” she said.
Ultimately, Van Susteren said she’s doing what she’s always done, whether at Fox or CNN. Not taking orders from anyone on what to cover or how.
""I believe the news is the place where you get facts and have a robust debate about very serious issues that affect all of us. There are some people who for whatever reason think this is a team sport,” Van Susteren said referring to her Fox fans who may be angry that she moved to MSNBC. ""And those are the ones I have a little fun responding to.""",0
"Another day, another round of evidence that authorities and the hotel’s involved are conducting a massive cover-up of what actually happened in Las Vegas during the worst mass shooting in American history.
The latest round of revelations comes in the form of a Fox News report that details the fact that MGM has sequestered security guard Jesus Campos in one of their hotels so that he is unable to speak to anyone or really do anything at all without the hotel itself knowing. Keep in mind, MGM already made Campos conduct a softball interview with Ellen while cancelling his other media appearances.
Can you say cover-up?!
“The arrangement has led to speculation that MGM wants to prevent the media from questioning Campos about the Oct. 1 massacre, in which a gunman opened fire from a hotel owned by the company. Campos, who was shot in a leg during the rampage that killed 58 people and injured more than 500, is on paid leave while he recovers,” reported Fox News.
An attorney for one of the victims told Fox that he believes that the MGM is keeping Campos in one of their hotels so he is unable to accidentally say something “problematic.” One can assume what we are actually talking about here is the supposed hero security guard speaking to any media outlet that would question his story. (since his story on its a face is complete nonsense)
“I really think it’s about not allowing reporters and lawyers and investigators to get to him,” attorney Moz Aziz told Fox. “I think they want to make sure he doesn’t make any statement that could really become problematic. And the reason they put him up on their property is so that they’ll know at all times where he is and who’s talking with him.”
That’s right, one of the “hero’s” on the night of the massacre is literally being watched as if he were a criminal with his every move controlled by MGM and seemingly designed to make sure he doesn’t blow the lid on the entire false flag operation.
This also comes at a time when authorities, both the LVMP and the FBI, are publicly stonewalling any sort of real investigation into the massacre. The FBI even went as far as to claim that it literally “doesn’t matter” that authorities are hiding all of the latest developments in the attack from the public.
Interestingly, the situation is getting so bad that even local mainstream news outlets are sounding the alarm, with the Las Vegas Review-Journalnoting that authorities had changed their entire demeanor after independent reporters began to fact check their claims.
“FBI cover-up artist Sandra Breault told the paper that, “It doesn’t matter,” when asked why there had been no new updates. “It’s an ongoing investigation, and unless there’s something to report, there will not be a briefing.”

"The Bill O’Reilly era on cable news is coming to a close. By week’s end, the self-proclaimed champion of ‘no spin’ news, who made a career claiming he looked out for ‘the folks,’ will be out at Fox News, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal late Tuesday evening.
Fox News is preparing to cut ties with its biggest star, Bill O’Reilly, according to people close to the situation. A final decision on Mr. O’Reilly’s fate could come as early as the next several days, the people said. Mr. O’Reilly, host of “The O’Reilly Factor,” has been ensnared in a sexual-harassment scandal related to previously undisclosed settlements he and Fox News paid to women who worked on or appeared on his program.
O’Reilly has been a fixture at Fox News since the network first went on the air in October of 1996. He’s also been the ratings champion of cable news for many of those years – something he was never shy about reminding anyone who would listen.
Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch created Fox News to rival CNN in the lucrative cable news market that was emerging in the 1990s. He chose the now-disgraced Roger Ailes, a combative former campaign operative for Presidents Reagan and Bush Sr., to build a conservative counterweight to what many on the right believe is a news industry dominated by liberals.
Ailes hired O’Reilly to anchor the all-important prime time line-up, and chose his show, “The O’Reilly Factor,” to air opposite the evening news on ABC, NBC, and CBS. Together they set the tone for the entire network, O’Reilly in front of the camera, Ailes behind it. Their mission: legitimize right-wing ideology – until then confined to the swamp of AM talk radio – by giving it a platform that looked and felt like a mainstream news network.
He liked to refer to himself as a ‘culture warrior’ – also the title of one of his many books – and his combative, confrontational, unapologetically conservative approach to the news became the standard by which all Fox News hosts would be measured. He used his popular show to launch attacks on everyone from the mainstream news media, to the so-called ‘Liberal elites’ in society and government, to what he termed the ‘secular progressives,’ people, groups, and institutions he insisted were determined to destroy traditional America. His influence at Fox News can been seen to this day.
Last year, a steady drip of sexual harassment allegations against Roger Ailes surfaced, and, under unrelenting pressure, Rupert Murdoch stepped in and forced him to resign. Today, it looks like O’Reilly is about to meet the same fate – for the same reasons.
Last month, the New York Times released a damning report exposing O’Reilly’s own long, multi-million dollar history of sexual harassment settlements with Fox News employees. Within a week of the story’s publication, over half of O’Reilly Factor advertisers had their ads pulled from appearing during the show, and since the Times story broke, more of his victims have surfaced.
O’Reilly himself never addressed the allegations, or his show’s catastrophic loss of advertisers – not on the air or through his lawyers. Last week, he abruptly announced he was taking a two-week vacation, and rumors of his impending ouster have swirled in his absence.
Today, it appears they are rumors no more. As O’Reilly might say himself, “The spin stops here.”",1
"The best thing you can possibly do for your sanity is turn off ALL television news.
All of it…including FAUX News.   We just don’t understand how deep the deception goes.  There is no such thing as “conservative” news and “liberal” news.  In fact, any news organization that tells you that they are bringing you “fair and balance” news cannot be trusted.
There is no such thing as fair and balanced Truth.  Truth stands on its own and does not have multiple perspectives.  Truth has no left side and no right side.  There are never two sides to the Truth.  Fake news is not real news.
I remember from the old Perry Mason shows that my parents used to watch when I was a child that witnesses placed their left hand on the Bible, raised their right hand, and swore to tell “the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth.”  Not fair and balanced Truth.  Not liberal or conservative truth. Today, Truth has become and opinion.
Today’s media is designed to confuse you.   It is structured to get you to question the obvious.  The media have taken a page from the book of the sleight of hand magicians who ask “Are you going to believe me or your eyes?”
We no longer believe our eyes.  Lying has become so common place…so much a part of the culture of America today…that it no longer bothers us when our elected officials lie to us.
“How do you know when a politician is lying?” goes the old joke.
“When you see his lips moving” rattles the punch line.
Well most Americans are punch drunk and incapable of discerning the Truth from propaganda.  That is what the mainstream media has done to us.  They have fogged our memories…bombarded us with fake news…to the point that we continue to re-elect the very people who lie to us.  We have lost the ability to think.
But there is a stirring going on in America.  A slow awakening is leading people to the realization that something is VERY wrong and that somewhere along the line we have been snookered.  The sleeping giant is beginning to roll over.
A steady stream of lies and disinformation is about to run dry.  Millions are finally finding their way to dry ground.  One by one the shoes are beginning to drop.
As much as you may hate to admit it much of the credit for this awakening is a direct result of the tactics of President Trump.  His no-holds-barred attack on FAKE NEWS has emboldened a former silent demographic of the American populace to once again “question authority.”
Isn’t it ironic, that same slogan planted during the rebellious sixties by LSD proponent Timothy Leary is resurrecting in the hearts of the now grandma and grandpa former hippies?  Leary and his communist cohorts embedded rebellion in the hearts of these same once-teenage gray hairs and today the “deplorables” are leading the charge against the now-socialist government.  It is a beautiful thing to watch.
These now “old-timers” have rebelled against a corrupt political system and four decades of socialist indoctrination to realize that they have lost the great nation that they thought they were leaving to their grandkids.
The genie is not going back into the bottle.
Most of the former hippies have watched with disdain as the President they elected is being assailed from all sides…including the “conservative Republicans” that they have been taught all of their lives were fighting for their values.  The mask has come off.  Their eyes are finally open.  They long for a return to a nation in which their grandbabies can be free.  They see it rapidly slipping away as a result of the wanton neglect on their watch.
The Left is losing and the Left knows it.  They have pulled out all of the stops in their attempt to dam up the flood of the “America First” cries from those who bear the scars of the Vietnam fiasco.  They remember what America used to be.  Trump is their champion…and they are aware of all of his warts…but they have cast their lot with this unvarnished, rough American.
I am reminded of the time in 1989 when then Michigan basketball Coach Bill Frieder was fired by AD Bo Schemblecher over rumors of Frieder taking a similar position at Arizona State just days before the NCAA tournament began.
“A Michigan man will coach Michigan” a defiant Schembechler said upon Frieder’s release.  The 1989 Wolverines went on to win the National Championship under Michigan man Steve Fisher.
American’s are sick of the double-talking globalists masquerading as their elected officials.  They have had enough of the Bushes, the Clintons, the McCains, and the McConnells.  They are up to their ears with the alphabet news channels.  They are sick of the education system and the anti-God, anti-American, anti-all-they-believe-in bilge oozing from the universities.
No one can predict how this whole thing is going to play out.  The Left is beginning to eat their own as every bullet they fire ends up being a blank.  The Left is being exposed.  Everything the media tells them is fake and they are sick of it.
Will the American ship survive?  Will the globalists and their nefarious agenda carry the day?  What kind of nation will the former hippies leave to their posterity?
Their cards are on the table.  The pot is right.  The Deplorables have gone “all-in” with the man with orange hair.
Come what may they will not be moved.  They don’t believe the lying media and they don’t care what Trump has done in the past.  When it is all said and done they will take the Bo Schembechler approach.  The Deplorables are digging in.  Donald Trump is their man.
They have chosen an America-first man to lead America.
Share if you are glad to see ex-hippies — now “deplorables” — standing up and questioning the political establishment.",1

But after a thrilling seven-game World Series for the third time in four years, baseball, a sport that was never far “down,” is headed back up, with just a handful of problems, most of them manageable. Meanwhile, the NFL has more intractable issues than a junkyard mutt has fleas. For the third time in four years, baseball had one of the all-time best World Series, each with a completely different flavor. In 2014, the Giants won on the back of Madison Bumgarner vs. the world; then last year, the Cubs grabbed their first title in 108years. Now we now have the “Houston Strongest” Series featuring two games that stand among the 10 best World Series games ever played, plus a jubilant, exuberant young champion that will bring power, energy, advanced critical thinking and athleticism to the sport for years.  This World Series was so good that when Game 7 was just a decent 5-1 game, it was not just anticlimactic but a shock that two teams so close — 34-34 total score — did not go 11 innings, change leads five times and hit 10 homers. After all, didn’t they hit seven homers in Game 2 and a record eight homers in Game 5? This Series had more blown leads than blown calls. On Sunday night, Major League Baseball’s TV ratings stomped the NFL by a third. Yes, of course, it’s the World Series, so it should. But it did.  This World Series cast baseball in sharp relief against an NFL season that so far is drab, injury-filled, controversy-laden and so full of parity that almost nobody is worth watching. However, the difference between the directions of the two sports is deeper than that and follows long trend lines.    Like the New Orleans Saints after Hurricane Katrina or the Red Sox after the Boston Marathon bombing, the Houston Astros played for their devastated city following Hurricane Harvey, and clinched their first World Series title in franchise history on Nov. 1. (Taylor Turner/The Washington Post)   These days, baseball is smart, innovative, in love with change and so dynamic you can hardly keep up with it, while the NFL has been asleep for decades, collecting cash and becoming sclerotic.   [Astros’ Series win may be the moment analytics conquered MLB for good]  MLB is broad-minded, inclusive, not just multicultural but multi-continental, and in touch with the best in traditional core American values. Yuli Gurriel didn’t just get booed to the high heavens in Southern California for his racist gesture and remark toward the Dodgers’ Yu Darvish in Game 3. The introduction of his name in the heart of Texas brought a strong undercurrent of boos and tepid cheers. And MLB’s commissioner said any sort of racist gesture or remark had “no place” in his game and would be disciplined strongly. These days, baseball is in sync with the lucrative digital world with its enormous marketable MLB data bank. MLB wishes for transformation and progress, while respecting its past. The half-in-the-bag-before-kickoff NFL, in its often family-unfriendly venues, is cornball and square and doesn’t know it has mustard on its forehead and beer spilled in its shoes. New ideas? Hey, congratulations on that zone blitz, 25 years ago. What, you stole the read option from college? That lasted 18 months.  Baseball evolves, sometimes so fast that your head swims. But it’s change that is fun, controversial and infinitely debatable. Just five years ago, nobody thought that, by now, most teams would use radical defensive shifts leaving huge swaths of the field undefended, or that hitters would discover “launch angle,” transform their value in one offseason and turn hitting theory on its head.  Back then, a blink ago, Stephen Strasburg’s fastball was news. Now, in the age of “core strength” and study of biomechanics, most teams have relievers who touch 100 mph and maybe a starter or two as well. Oh, Lordy, what are hitters going to do? Maybe choke up three inches on the bat with two strikes like those bums Joey Votto and Anthony Rizzo. Or, disguised behind one stance, have multiple swing styles so that you can use the whole field like Daniel Murphy.    Who says you’re a “starting pitcher” or a “reliever.” Once you get to the postseason, you’re just “a pitcher.” Be ready. Rich Hill got pounded on the back with congratulations after a pair of World Series starts in which he got just 12 and 14 outs. Brad Peacock and Charlie Morton, starters, got the final 11 and 12 outs in Houston’s wins in Games 3 and 7.  “I’m not trying to bring back the three-inning save,” said Astros Manager A. J. Hinch, a Stanford grad. But he was. Everybody from Firpo Marberry in the 1920s to Rollie Fingers and Goose Gossage would be proud. If the Dodgers had come back to win Game 7, one hero would have been that long reliever with 12 outs of shutout work: Clayton Kershaw. We now have starters who, on occasion, are not even allowed to pitch long enough to qualify for a win, but we have “high-leverage” multi-inning relievers, such as Andrew Miller, who worked in the innings of most dire need in 2016 — 19 innings in 10 games — and almost got Cleveland a World Series win.  Hello, NFL, are you around here anywhere? Speak up. About what? The NFL hasn’t had a new idea in 15 years, unless Bill Belichick had it. The NFL is just formulaic frat-house-on-the-lawn touch football with conservative five-yard passes that you could throw when you were 14years old. Bubble screen, shallow pick route, draw, stretch sweep, quick hitch, punt. Yippee!  Hard licks, once the pride of the game, have become just another CTE crack in the wall. What Night Train Lane and Dick Butkus once did to make us pump our fists now turns our stomachs because we know every player is just human fodder with an expiration date on his brain, except he doesn’t know what year it says yet. We all sacrificed knees to football, but nobody told us that “practice in pads today” was just a couple of hours of killing brain cells for early-onset everything.  If you want to know how appealing baseball is becoming, relative to the NFL, just compare their problems. The NFL’s issues make you shudder. Baseball’s problems just make you think and have a nice debate about how to get better.  Were there “too many strikeouts”? Yes. Hitters are going to have to broaden their approach and not just settle for one swing, repeated endlessly, that “covers the plate” and produces power — a mode of attack as inflexible as a rattlesnake strike. You can’t tell a rattlesnake to “bite that guy behind you.” That’s not in its do-one-thing-well repertoire. And the big leagues are chockablock with players who can’t hit “the other way” or bunt to beat shifts. These guys, like poor, lost Dodgers super-rookie Cody Bellinger, who fanned 17 times in the World Series, are going to have to learn two brand-new words: “opposite” and “field.” Were there too many homers? Yes. But that’s the easiest fix in the world. Commissioners never tell you how and in what seasons MLB decided it needed to jack up the ball a bit, or encourage umps to call a wider, narrower or deeper strike zone to fine-tune the game’s scoring to aesthetically pleasing levels. But after they retire, they sure will. One ex-commissioner told me they used a juiced ball in spring training to see how it would work in season. After two or three days, so many pitchers had nearly been impaled by invisible liners that all the balls — they may have been called “The 10-X” — were taken out of “commission,” so to speak, though they’re probably still in a warehouse in Area 51.    This is the sport that has lowered the mound, added the DH for more offense, turned its eye away from PEDs (the only real sin along these lines) and gotten umps to reshape the strike zone to the point where Tom Glavine, by the end of his career, lamented the loss of his 22-inch-wide plate. Where did this built-to-code 17-inch-wide hideosity come from?  This World Series, and this entire postseason, which had six winner-take-all games, crystallized what baseball has become. It’s the sport where we talk about civilized issues such as how to improve pace of play by, maybe, holding each team to two mound visits per game.  Meanwhile, the NFL, with TV viewership down 18.7 percent from two years ago at the same season midpoint, waits each week for its latest current or recent star to announce the damage football has done to his whole life.  Baseball is the sport where we tsk-tsk about too many whiffs and, oh, isn’t it terrible that two players hit more than 50 homers. NFL teams keep the police scanner on 24/7 with lawyers at the ready. Baseball looks like it might have a pretty good commissioner. Football still has Roger Goodell and — this tells you everything you need to know — thinks that is the good news.  The NFL didn’t need another problem. Now it has to cope with 5-foot-6 Jose Altuve’s smile.

"Now that Fox News has officially given Bill O’Reilly the boot, another long-time star in the Fox lineup could be under fire.
This week, Jeremy Peters, a reporter at The New York Times, joined MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” to discuss the shakeup at Fox. He caught everyone off guard when he insisted that Hannity could be next on the hot seat. Peters argued that Hannity’s pro-Trump stance has put him at odds with Rupert Murdoch’s sons, who are now top executives at the news channel.
The response was prompted by Joe Scarborough, who asked if the Murdoch brothers intended to ‘remake’ Fox News and whether Peters suspected anyone else was in “the family’s crosshairs.”
“I think you have to look at somebody like Sean Hannity,” Peters replied without hesitation, “and question whether or not his almost propaganda-like attitude and programming every night is going to be acceptable in the minds of the family which is clearly trying to shift the network in another direction.”
“It’s also very confusing because he does it in Russian,” Scarborough joked, referring to the unproven allegations that President Donald Trump colluded with Russia to win the election.
There is no question that the liberal media dislikes Hannity, but it’s not likely he is going anywhere anytime soon. Getting rid of another popular prime-time star would be too risky a move for Fox News. Sorry to rain on your parade, Peters.",1
"No one's going to read Leigh Bardugo's newest book, Six Of Crows, without thinking about Ocean's 11. No one's going to hear the premise — six young criminals hired to break into (and then out of) the most secure prison in the world — without thinking of Danny Ocean and his crew. Certainly no critic is going to write about the thing without making the connection. It would be stupid not to.
Because Six Of Crows is a heist story. It is so purely and simply a heist story that comparisons to one of the best heist stories ever told are inevitable. If Ocean's 11 was a textbook exercise in plotting, character development and the ol' bait-and-switch reveal, then Six Of Crows is a thesis on how these lessons can be deployed in genre fiction.
We begin with Kaz Brekker, 17-year-old criminal prodigy and second in command of a gang called the Dregs. He has a mysterious past, a cool nickname (Dirtyhands), and Danny Ocean's knack for misdirection and covering all his bets. The first time we get a good view of him, he's having one of those brain-on-brain showdowns with another gang leader where he shows his mastery of the situation by never moving from the mark on which he stands while, all around him, a plan carefully laid off-page comes clicking together with clockwork precision. It's a nice set-piece, hobbled only by the fact that while it acts as the beginning of the tale, it isn't actually the beginning of the book.
No, Bardugo tacks on a long-ish (and dull) first chapter that serves both as a prologue and a gentle drop into her world for those not already familiar with the universe she writes in. And while I understand the utility of such a thing — particularly in the YA sphere, where this book ostensibly lives — it's one of those things that most readers will just have to suffer through in order to get to the good stuff that follows.
And yes, there is a lot of good stuff. I mean, how could there not be? Second only to submarine stories, the heist story is the most compact and driven of all possible plot frames. There's a thing in a place (in this case, a scientist/magician with the secret formula for a kind of magical super-drug, locked away in a supposedly impenetrable prison), then a team of thieves who have to go to the place and steal the thing. Complications, of course, arise.
Bardugo does not stray far from these mechanics — no good heist writer does. Where the joy comes is in the interaction between the team of thieves, the brains of the boss and the machinations of the law. There are courtships and betrayals among Brekker's crew, long-simmering lusts, dark motivations laid out one by one as Bardugo bounces from one narrator to the next to the next, handing off the point of view with each chapter. And, always and forever, there's the Big Job there waiting at the end of the long trail — breaking into the Ice Court in the far North, grabbing Professor Maguffin and getting out again in one piece.
So sure, Six Of Crows has a muscle car's drive and a cast that hangs with you like they were made of magnets, but the one thing that bothered me throughout? The characters' ages. Pretty much the entire crew are 17 years old (with, I believe, one notable exception). And that's fine. Bardugo is aiming straight for that YA sweet spot, and 17 is the magic number.
But if you're going to write about 17-year-old characters, it's your responsibility to make them think and act like 17-year-olds, which none of Bardugo's six crows do. Save the young demolitions expert (who is shy and easily embarrassed and mystified by pretty much everything happening around him), there's not one who couldn't suddenly age up to 32 and be more believable for that one cosmetic change. Brekker, in particular, talks (and thinks) like a 50-year-old criminal mastermind pulled out of retirement for one last job, his absolute surety of all human motives and seemingly bottomless bag of felonious tricks (and occasional murderous impulses) just way too hard-bitten even for this world.
But it's still an impressive world. Bardugo has created a grimy fantasy with a thin blank-punk veneer laid over the top. There are knives and rifles, magic and technology — everything mashed together in a jumble of influences that is wickedly attractive because (and not in spite of) the characters inhabiting it so fully. It's a slick trick of world-building that eschews the info-dump (save that first regrettable chapter) in favor of making the world simply the world, defined by the way the characters move through it. The smell of coal smoke in the morning does more to set a scene than 10,000 words describing the industry that produces it.
And Bardugo certainly knows how her world smells.

'Die of spite, America': ISIS says US is ‘being run by an idiot’
Eleven companies have  said their advertisements will no longer run during the 8-9 p.m. Eastern Time slot, when the ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" hosted by Bill O'Reilly, airs. (Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images)
More advertisers have removed spots from Fox News host Bill O’Reilly’s show in the wake of a New York Times investigation that found Fox News and O’Reilly paid off even more alleged sexual harassment victims than initially thought.
One of O’Reilly’s top advertisers, Mercedes-Benz announced Monday that it would not run any more commercials during O’Reilly’s show. The automaker instead “reassigned” its advertising to other Fox News spots.
“Yes, we had advertising running on ‘The O’Reilly Factor’ (we run on most major cable news shows) and it has been reassigned in the midst of this controversy,”Donna Boland, Mercedes-Benz corporate communications manager, said in a statement. “The allegations are disturbing and, given the importance of women in every aspect of our business, we don’t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now.”
Since the announcement by Mercedes-Benz, 10more advertisers have followed suit. Advertisers refusing to be associated with O’Reilly in the wake of the sexual harassment lawsuits include automakersBMW, Hyundai, and Mitsubishi; pharmaceutical manufacturers GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Consumer Products; email marketing company Constant Contact; men’s clothing line Untuckit; Ainsworth Pet Nutrition; insurance agency Allstate; and asset management firm T. Rowe Price, NBC News reported.
A representative for Hyundai clarified to CNN that it does not currently advertise on O’Reilly’s program, but that as a result of the “recent and disturbing allegations,” it has reversed its decision to run upcoming commercials.
The 11 companies have not withdrawn their money from Fox News altogether. The companies only said their advertisements will no longer run during the 8-9 p.m. Eastern Time slot, when the “The O’Reilly Factor” airs.
“We value our partners and are working with them to address their current concerns about the O’Reilly Factor. At this time, the ad buys of those clients have been re-expressed into other FNC programs,”Paul Rittenberg, executive vice president of advertising sales at Fox News, said.
The business decisions came just days after the New York Times reported Fox News and O’Reilly paid as many as five women up to $13 million to settle sexual harassment lawsuits. The five complaints were in addition to multiple allegations made last year against ousted Fox News chairman Roger Ailes. O’Reilly was named in one of the lawsuits against Ailes and the company, although O’Reilly was not a defendant.
O’Reilly, for his part, has pushed back on the allegations, but seemed to admit paying to settle at least some of the claims.
“Just like other prominent and controversial people, I’m vulnerable to lawsuits from individuals who want me to pay them to avoid negative publicity,” O’Reilly said in a statement released over the weekend, according to NBC News.
O’Reilly later added:“I have put to rest any controversies to spare my children.”
21st Century Fox, which is Fox News’ parent company, noted that none of the women who alleged sexual harassment called the company’s anonymous hotline but said it “takes matters of workplace behavior very seriously.” The network has renewed O’Reilly’s contract for an undisclosed period of time.
O’Reilly’s show generated more than $446 million in advertising revenue from 2014-2016.
“The O’Reilly Factor” is currently the highest-rated show on cable news, averaging around 4 million viewers per night.

"A little coffee shop called CUPS Coffee & Tea that’s located in Roanoke, Virginia has gone crazy viral for placing an offensive sign outside their shop.
The sign displays prices for coffee, but they’re not the normal prices you see. A small cup of coffee for me is cheaper than it might be for you.
Because if you’re rude in this man’s coffee shop, then you’re paying a high price. It’s basically an extra charge for having no manners. If you’re a pleasant customer who has nice manners and treats people well, then your coffee is cheap!
Of course some people threw a temper tantrum. Not as bad as the people in Milwaukee who rioted when a known criminal was shot by a black cop, but the attitude about the sign was just as unnecessary.
The sign is only offensive to people who are guilty of the behavior that the sign is charging extra for.
If you’re a jerk of a customer, then you’re going to pay more for a cup of coffee. Be nice, pay less. It wouldn’t hurt for us to be nice to each other once in a while. It might even put us in a good mood.
US Herald – The coffee shop’s owner Austin Simms explained that he never meant to get so much attention when he originally wrote the message on his sandwich board sign outside his coffee shop, CUPS Coffee & Tea in Roanoke, Virginia. Simms had grown tired with a certain type of behavior that he continued to see more and more of in modern society, so he decided to act and try to put a stop to it or at least keep it out of his store.
Simms reportedly put the sign out on Sunday and by Wednesday his shop was swarming with cameramen from multiple news stations looking to get the word out about the viral sign.
That’s a great sign with a wonderful message. We SHOULD be nicer to each other. A little bit of nice goes further than a lot of mean, that’s for sure.
Keep spreading the good vibes around the world and we will certainly benefit from it.
Of course, if Black Lives Matter could understand what it’s like to be nice and do things that encourage a positive change, instead of throwing temper tantrums, blocking traffic, and burning down stores, then we’d see an influential change there too.",1
"The future of President Donald Trump’s promised border wall lies in massive pieces in the California desert.
NBC News got an early look at the eight nearly-finished prototypes, assembled near the existing fence along the U. S.-Mexico border miles outside San Diego, ahead of Thursday's deadline for the sections to be completed.
Four of the prototypes are made from concrete and are competing for the chance to be used for the concrete portions of the wall.
The other four prototypes are made from non-concrete materials that are competing to be used for the stretches of barrier that can be seen through.
All are between 18 and 30 feet high.
After the Thursday deadline passes, each sample will be tested on several criteria, officials said.
“We're going to test it for breachability. For the subterranean aspect,” Roy Villareal, the Deputy Chief Patrol Agent of the San Diego Sector of CBP, told NBC News. “Can we dig under it? Can we cut through it? Can we scale over it?”
According to a rendering released by U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials, Trump’s wall has been envisioned as a multi-faceted barrier that features a concrete stretch facing the U.S. and a non-concrete stretch facing Mexico that would allow officials to see through it.
This image shows the concrete portion of the wall (E) would sit on the U. S.-facing side of an electronically monitored zone and another barrier (B) — which can be seen through — faces toward the Mexico. The monitoring zone would be about 150 feet wide and alert patrol agents if someone breached the initial border barrier.
But even with the prototypes nearing completion, the question over how the U. S. would fund the entire wall remains unanswered. Trump has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay for the wall; Mexico has said just as many times that it will not.
The White House’s proposed 2018 budget seeks $1.8 billion to begin building new sections of the wall and replace existing ones, which would include money to build 28 miles of levee wall in the Rio Grande Valley and 14 miles of new wall to replace fences south of San Diego. White House officials have suggested that the entire wall project could cost between $8 and $12 billion, but internal DHS assessments suggest the cost could be higher — as much as $21 billion.
Even bigger questions, however, surround whether a massive wall would be effective.
Villareal acknowledged “It's hard to gauge” whether a massive wall would cut historically-low apprehensions along the border.
“There's always going to be some form of crime, or in this case, illegal migration,” he said.
Residents of Mexico put it more bluntly.
“I don't know why Donald Trump is so obsessed with this unnecessary waste of money,” Pedro Murillo, a man who tried to cross the border as young man, told NBC News from the Mexican side of the border. “Because, there will always be a way to cross.”",0

"Clayton Cook had just married his wife Brittany, but he had to take one more leap— into a lake to save a drowning boy.
CTV News reports the Cambridge, Ontario, couple were having their pictures taken post-ceremony on Friday when a young boy was pushed into the water.
""While I was taking solo pictures of the bride this little guy was pushed into the river behind me by another child,"" read a Facebook post by the couple's photographer Hatt Photography. ""By the time the bride noticed and shouted out, Clayton had already jumped down and brought him to safety.""
BBC reported the incident happened at Victoria Park lake in Kitchener, Ontario.
Clayton described to CTV News what caused him to act.
""His face was underwater and he was fighting, like he was really fighting,"" he told CTV News. ""Luckily, he was only a little guy... and I honestly just sort of hopped him up.""
At first, Brittany thought her new husband was joking, she told BBC.
""We'd like to think most people would probably make the same choice,"" she told BBC.
For the Internet's sake, photographer Darren Hatt was able to snap some memorable photos of the heroic save.
""When I first saw what was going on, my first priority was to assess the situation and I saw that Clay had things under control,"" he said. ""But once I saw that the boy was out, I just fired off a few quick snaps from my hip, not even really expecting them to turn out. But they did, and I think they beautifully captured a moment that my couple will certainly never forget.”",0
"Taiwanese men have spent this weekend celebrating after the news broke that one of Japan’s leading producers of adult movies is planning to hold auditions in the coming months for male actors. Japan’s adult movie industry has long faced a shortage of male actors and an over-supply of female stars, and the imbalance has reached a critical levelin recent times. Having investigated every opportunity to recruit domestically, some of Japan’s major studios are now looking abroad to find sources of male talent, and Taiwan has been identified by a Tokyo-based producer.
According to reports by Taiwan’s local media, the JAV studio planning to hold auditions in Taiwan is黄金のペニス, one of the country’s first producers of adult films. Speaking with a Taiwan news channel, one of the studio’s executive producers,Nishi Botan, was positive on the prospects for sourcing male actors in Taiwan. “The history between our nations is, of course, favorable,” he pointed out, noting thatTaiwan was underJapanese rule from1895 to1945 before the Allied powers prevailed in World War II. “There is still plenty of positive sentiment in Japan towards Taiwan, so we don’t anticipate any backlash from our customers.”
Mr Botan explained that黄金のペニス’s earlier recruitment of a male Korean dramaactor to star in his studio’sJAV productions had not been met with enthusiasm from Japanese audiences. “Despite the man’s physical prowess and technique, many customers boycotted the titles he performed in, which we attribute to negative attitudes towards Korea. With Taiwan, we don’t anticipate any such issues.”

(Before It's News)Scientists from ITMO University in Saint Petersburg and Hebrew University in Jerusalem have found a way to recover a protein structure after its chemical denaturation. The method is based on electrostatic interaction between folded, or denatured, proteins and alumina, which unwrap them.
Proteins, especially including enzymes as accelerators of chemical reactions, are the basis of pharmaceutical and food industries. Meanwhile, 80% of these substances are lost during synthesis. Influenced by unfavorable factors like strong acids, alkalis or heating, proteins denature, that is they lose the native shape and simultaneously any chemical activity. Thus, the industry seeks for a universal method for recovering protein structure, which could make the production cheaper and more effective. To manufacture enzyme-based drugs and foods on an industrial scale it is especially important to find a way to recover mixtures of proteins as renaturating each particular type of enzymes separately takes a lot of time and is costly and inefficient.
Russian chemists in cooperation with foreign colleagues proposed a solution to this issue. They developed a technology process that gave a second life to proteins having returned their molecules to the original form after denaturation.
In the new research, the chemists unfolded molecules of three enzymes: carbonic anhydrase, phosphatase and peroxidase. Denatured by a strong alkaline, the proteins were mixed with nanoparticles of alumina in water. Due to electrostatic interaction, the enzymes attracted the nanoparticles and engaged them in forming a supramolecular complex with not chemical, but physical bonds.
This shell of nanoparticles protected protein molecules from aggregation enabling the scientists to easily extract them from the aggressive media. Washed from denaturing substances, the enzymes restored their structure by themselves.",1

"Disney earnings have been limp this year because of challenges at its vast television business, and the entertainment company’s fiscal fourth quarter results, expected after the close of trading on Thursday, will probably be no exception.

However, since you are now reading, you’ll almost certainly be interested in this research that looked into the clicking and sharing behaviors of social media users reading content (or not) and then sharing that on social media.
We here atDBL notice long ago that many of our followers will happily like, share and offer an opinion on an article – all without ever reading it.
Were not the only ones to notice this. Last April, NPR shared an article on their Facebook page which asked “Why doesn’t America read anymore?” The joke, of course, is that there was no article.
They waited to see if their followers would weigh in with an opinion without clicking the link, and they weren’t disappointed.

"Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg announced the social networking giant would strengthen its ad targeting policies after a recent scandal which let ad buyers target anti-Semitic categories.
In a blog post, Sandberg announced several steps the company is taking to make sure its ad-targeting policies and tools are strengthened.
""First, we're clarifying our advertising policies and tightening our enforcement processes to ensure that content that goes against our community standards cannot be used to target ads,"" Sandberg wrote in the post. ""This includes anything that directly attacks people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity, or disabilities or diseases. Such targeting has always been in violation of our policies and we are taking more steps to enforce that now.""
The tech exec also said the company would be adding more human review and oversight to a process that is largely automated.
Lastly, Facebook will create a program ""to encourage people on Facebook to report potential abuses of our ads system to us directly.""
""We hope these changes will prevent abuses like this going forward,"" Sandberg continued. ""If we discover unintended consequences in the future, we will be unrelenting in identifying and fixing them as quickly as possible. We have long had a firm policy against hate on Facebook. Our community deserves to have us enforce this policy with deep caution and care.""
Last week, news organization ProPublica said it paid Facebook $30 to display three ""promoted posts"" in the news feeds of people who expressed interest in topics like ""Jew hater,"" ""How to burn jews,"" or, ""History of 'why jews ruin the world.'""
ProPublica found that the ads were approved by Facebook in 15 minutes.
After being alerted by ProPublica, Facebookremoved the anti-Semitic categories. A Facebook spokeswoman told Fox News the anti-Semitic categories were ""self-reported based on how people filled out their profiles.""
""Essentially, users filling out their profiles may have added descriptions like 'Jew hater',"" the spokeswoman wrote, ""which then would appear to advertisers as potential categories of users to which ads could be directed, no algorithm involved.""
FACEBOOK UNCOVERS $100K IN FAKE AD SPENDING TIED TO RUSSIAN OPERATIVES DURING 2016 ELECTION
Earlier this month, Facebook uncovered approximately $100,000, spread across approximately 3,000 ads, in fraudulent ad spending across its network tied to the 2016 U. S. Presidential election.
As more advertising moves online, ad targeting has become an issue for the dominant players in the space, including Google.
Google’s ad targeting is also in the spotlight after a report that the tech giant allowed advertisers to run ads targeted to anti-Semitic and racist keywords.
BuzzFeedreportedtheGoogleadvertising platform let advertisers target ads to people typing racist and bigoted terms into its search bar. Google also suggested additional racist and bigoted terms, according to the report.
As part of its investigation, BuzzFeed found that typing “why do jews ruin everything” into Google’s ad-buying tool generated 77 keyword suggestions, such as “jews ruin the world.” When BuzzFeed typed “white people ruin” as a potential advertising keyword into the ad platform, it suggested running ads next to searches including “black people ruin everything.”
Google said that it has turned off the suggestions and any ads that made it through. ""Our goal is to prevent our keyword suggestions tool from making offensive suggestions, and to stop any offensive ads appearing,” explained Sridhar Ramaswamy, the company’s senior vice president of Ads, in a statement emailed to Fox News last week. “We have language that informs advertisers when their ads are offensive and therefore rejected. In this instance, ads didn’t run against the vast majority of these keywords, but we didn't catch all these offensive suggestions.”
According to research firm eMarketer, Google and Facebook account for nearly three-quarters of the projected $83 billion in digital ad spending in the U. S.

"ROME, Italy — He is perhaps the biggest online influencer of them all.
Pope Francis became the latest thought leader to give a ""TED talk"" late Tuesday, in a pre-recorded but surprise video message calling for a ""revolution of tenderness"" and for humility among the world's powerful.
During an 18-minute address, the pontiff also touched on other subjects close to his heart: the culture of waste, solidarity with the disadvantaged, and societies that are putting products ahead of people.
Francis spoke to an audience at the latest TED conference in Vancouver, Canada. TED, a non-profit media organization, shares online recordings of so-called TED talks from experts and key thinkers.
Bruno Giussani, TED's International Curator, wrote in a blog that it took over a year to coordinate the first pontifical contribution.
""It took many discussions to make the talk happen — and several trips to Rome over more than a year,"" Giussani wrote. ""When I first approached the Vatican, it's fair to say that not many there knew of TED. So there was a lot of explaining to do.""
The talk was recorded at Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican guesthouse where Francis lives. ""Of course Pope Francis decided by himself what he wanted to say in the talk,"" Giussani wrote.
Francis began by recounting his own humble upbringing as an Italian immigrant in Argentina.
""There is a saying in Argentina: Power is like drinking gin on an empty stomach. You feel dizzy, you get drunk, you lose your balance, and you will end up hurting yourself and those around you,"" Francis said in Italian. ""Through humility and concrete love, on the other hand, power — the highest, the strongest one — becomes a service, a force for good.""
He also called for a ""revolution of tenderness,"" explaining: ""Tenderness means to use our hands and our heart to comfort the other, to take care of those in need.""
On the problems of global consumerism, he told the audience: ""Only by educating people to a true solidarity will we be able to overcome the culture of waste,"" adding that the issue was not just about food and goods but also ""people who are cast aside by our techno-economic systems which, without even realizing it, are now putting products at their core instead of people.""
He concluded his talk: ""We all need each other. And so, please, think of me as well with tenderness, so that I can fulfil the task I have been given for the good of others, of each and every one, of all of you, of all of us.""",0

"Not only here in the United States, but in many countries around the world, the digital economy is something that is a huge focus for the future. Many of those countries lack the resources that we have here at home and so working online in a digital arena is the only hope they have for providing an income for a large portion of the population. Here in the USA, many workers lost their jobs as a result of the crash in 2008, and the ensuing Great Recession. Some of them turned to freelancing online and have become a major portion of the digital economy. Unfortunately, that begs the question: how will inadequate cyber security impact this sector? It’s still too early to tell, but one marketing agency, Single Grain, has some thoughts on the matter.
With computers being the very foundation of most advances in technology today, it would almost be unthinkable to go forward into the future without the benefits they provide. However, for every benefit, there always seems to be a disadvantage, and so it goes with the digital economy. That would be cyber security. Americans are asked to rely increasingly on the safety and security computers are supposed to provide, but with all the recent hacks, and major ones at that, it’s obvious that even the very technology we trust with our well-being are prone to attacks we can’t see coming.
In a recent article in welivesecurity.com, author Stephen Cobb asked this very same question. He noted that even at the dawning of this massive surge in Internet usage in the early days – the late 90s – people were already in tune with the potential security risks. He, like so many others, wonder why those concerned Internet users weren’t more vocal, forcing security to be a major issue with IT professionals. Perhaps if more people had spent more time keeping those worm holes closed in the very beginning, cyber security professionals wouldn’t have such a hard road ahead of them.
Once again, search giant Google is the forerunner in statistics. Here they sought to see just what people thought of cyber security and how great a risk they thought it would be. Here is what they said:
So you see, 68.5% of those surveyed understand the very real danger we face from breaches and hacks to all out attacks.
Our world is becoming increasingly reliant on technology and digital technology (the Internet) leads the pack. At this point in time, it is already a huge concern, but in the future, if more isn’t done in the line of security, it may bring the digital economy to a screeching halt. That future is getting closer by the minute. What are your thoughts? Do you think cyber security poses a great risk to the digital economy? If you do, you are with the majorit",1
"The decision by United Airlines to deny entry onto a flight to two girls who were wearing leggings has highlighted the changing culture of air travel in the U. S., aviation historians say.
The incident set off a wave of online criticism, with some calling out the airline for what they saw as sexist or old-fashioned dress code policies.
Actress and activist Patricia Arquette weighed in on Twitter on Sunday, saying the airline's dress code for friends and family of its employees was ""outdated"" and that a leggings ban ""disproportionately"" affected women and girls.
Even competitor Delta Air Lines weighed in on the controversy, trolling United with a tweet.
Aviation experts said the industry has transformed from the time when the act of flying itself was a special occasion and people donned suits and formal business wear to travel by air.
“Flying was glamorous, it was expensive and so it was generally done by primarily businessmen,” Janet Bednarek, an aviation historian and professor at the University of Dayton, told NBC News. “They flew on business and just as there was a dress code within the office when they were flying and representing their business they dressed accordingly.”
Bednarek added that there was a certain status that came along with flying, especially during the 1950s and 60s, as the travel method was not yet an option for many Americans.
“Flying was something that people did not do as an everyday occurrence like it is today,” she said. “It was a special occasion if you flew and people dressed accordingly.”
The online firestorm began when Colorado resident and anti-gun activist Shannon Watts took to Twitter to document what she said was an United Airlines gate agent refusing to let two girls board a flight on Sunday morning to Minneapolis from Denver International Airport because they were in leggings.
The airline responded to Watts on Twitter, saying in part that they had the right to refuse to transport passengers “not properly clothed” and that the girls were “pass travelers,” meaning they were relatives or friends of an airline employee and receive either free or heavily discounted air travel.
“There is a dress code for pass travelers as they are representing UA when they fly,” the company said in a tweet.
On Monday, United Airlines Spokesman Jonathan Guerin told NBC News that unacceptable attire for pass travel included “swimwear, see-through clothing, flip flops, slippers, anything with holes or tears, and anything that reveals your midriff or undergarments and form-fitting Lycra or spandex pants, such as leggings.” Guerin confirmed two teenagers traveling with an adult were not allowed to board the flight on Sunday.
“We regularly remind our employees that when they place a family member or friend on a flight for free as a standby passenger, they need to follow our dress code,” he said.
Related: After Richard Marx Episode, Airline Says More Men Will Help 'Beef Up' Security
The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA stood behind the airline's decision in a statement to NBC News on Monday.
""There is a policy for employee travel that includes a dress code out of respect for all of United's passengers,"" Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said. ""We believe this is the case of a communication breakdown and social media frenzy. As we say in transportation ... moving on.""
Seth Kaplan, managing editor of industry journal Airline Weekly, told NBC News that it wasn’t very long ago that pass travelers in particular were required to dress “quite formally.”
“Twenty years ago most passengers no longer had to get dressed up just to fly, but pass riders still had to get dressed up,"" he said.
“As far as customers, it has all gotten less formal over the years and for pass riders it has gotten less formal in tandem, but they’ve always been more formal,” he said.
But Bednarek warned that part of the issue with maintaining such dress codes in the modern era was the perception that dress codes were primarily aimed at women, not men, and could have unintended sexist outcomes.
""I think any critique of a dress code, and I think that critique is valid, is that it seems to set more stringent standards for women than it does for men,"" she said.
She noted that according to Watts' account, the man traveling with the teenage girls was wearing shorts, but was not given any trouble.
And as flights themselves have become less comfortable, with many airlines increasingly shrinking their seat size and no longer offering many amenities free of charge, the issue of dress codes on flights was likely to continue being an issue for airlines, she said.
“It’s a complex problem,” Bednarek said. “I am flying soon and I am looking for the most comfortable outfit I can find.”",0
"The USS John S. McCain, a guided-missile destroyer, was involved in a collision early Monday with a oil tanker east of Singapore and the Strait of Malacca resulting in damage to its port side aft (left rear), according to the U. S. Navy.
Search and rescue efforts are underway, U. S. Navy's 7th Fleet says. Officials say 10 sailors are missing and five are injured. They say that four of the injured were medically evacuated by a Republic of Singapore Navy Puma helicopter to a hospital in Singapore for non-life threatening injuries. The fifth injured sailor did not require further medical attention, according to officials.
The Singaporean Navy is sending assets to assist and the USS America is en route to help. The collision was reported at 6:24 a.m. local time, the U. S. Navy says.
""In addition to tug boats out of Singapore, the Republic of Singapore Navy ship RSS Gallant, RSN helicopters and Police Coast Guard vessel Basking Shark are currently in the area to render assistance,"" the Navy's statement read.
USS John S. McCain is sailing under her own power and is heading to port, the Navy added.
Senator John McCain sent the following message on Twitter in response: ""Cindy & I are keeping America's sailors aboard the USS John S McCain in our prayers tonight.""
President Trump reportedly was informed of the collision Sunday night after returning to Washington and responded by saying ""that's too bad,"" according to a print journalist part of the pool traveling with the commander-in-chief.
A couple hours later, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to offer condolences to those affected by the collision:
Also, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders wrote on Twitter that ""our hearts and prayers go out to all the brave men and women aboard #USSJohnSMcCain"":
Malaysia's navy chief Ahmad Kamarulzaman Ahmad Badaruddin tweeted that two Malaysian naval ships were deployed to help look for the missing U. S. sailors, The Associated Press reports.
In addition, images posted on Twitter purportedly show a gaping hole in the McCain's side near the waterline:
The ship was on its way to Singapore after finishing what the Navy called ""routine patrols"" in the South China Sea. One of those patrols was a Freedom of Navigation mission near contested islands which China has built and claims as their own in the South China around August 10.
The Navy says the USS John S. McCain was commissioned in 1994 and carries a crew of 23 officers, 24 chief petty officers and 291 enlisted sailors. It was named for John S. McCain, Sr. and John S. McCain, Jr. who were both Admirals in the U. S. Navy, Reuters news agency reports.
Senator McCain -- a Vietnam-era naval aviator who was shot down and held as a prisoner of war for nearly six years -- is currently undergoing treatment for brain cancer.
The vessel that was struck, Alnic MC, is a 30,000+ ton oil/chemical tanker built in 2007. It's 600 feet long and 105 feet wide and sails under the Liberian flag. Its owner according to searches is Energetic Tank Inc. and its operator is Stealth Maritime Corporation S. A.
The Singapore government said no crew were injured, but it did incur damage to a compartment at the front of the ship some 23 feet above its waterline, AP writes.
A crew member from the Alnic MC spoke with the Reuters news agency over the phone to say that there were nearly 12,000 tons of fuel aboard, but there was no spill.
""There is no oil spill. We were carrying fuel oil from Taiwan to discharge to Singapore ... We are proceeding to Raffles Reserved Anchorage where the owners will investigate the matter. There was some damage to the valve,"" the unidentified crew member told Reuters.
Officials say an investigation is underway. The extent of damage and personnel injuries is being determined.
Meanwhile, the 7th Fleet has setup phone numbers for family members to call: on base at 315-243-1728 and internationally at 011-81-46-816-1728.
AP writes that the Malacca Strait is between Malaysia to the northeast and Indonesia to the southwest, with the city-state of Singapore at the tip of the Malay Peninsula.
This collision comes on the heels of another incident involving the USS Fitzgerald.
The captain of the destroyer, two senior officers and at least a dozen sailors are being disciplined for thehorrifying collisionthat killedseven sailorsin June off the coast of Japan.
Thirty-five sailors were asleep in a compartment when the bow of the Philippine ship punched a 17-by-13 foot hole in the Fitzgerald's hull. Seven sleeping closest to the hole drowned but 28 somehow made it out alive, even though the entire space was nearly flooded within 30 to 60 seconds.",0
"A supercomputer built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be on board a SpaceX spacecraft when it launches on a resupply mission to the International Space Station Monday. The computer will be used in a year-long high-performance computing experiment during its time in orbit.
The Spaceborne Computer will be in the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft that is scheduled to launch from Kennedy Space Center on Aug. 14. Designed to eventually support astronauts’ computing and communication needs on missions to Mars, the technology will be closely monitored during its time on the ISS.
NASA SEARCHES FOR PLANETARY PROTECTION OFFICER TO SAVE EARTH FROM ALIEN CONTAMINATION
“We didn’t make any hardware modifications to these components; instead we created a unique water-cooled enclosure for the hardware and developed purpose-built system software to address the environmental constraints and reliability requirements of supercomputing in space,” explained Mark Fernandez, Americas technology officer of SGI at HPE, in an email to Fox News.
Factors that could impact computing during space missions include unstable electrical power, irregular cooling, radiation, solar flares, subatomic particles and micrometeoroids.
ASTRONAUTS GOING TO MARS COULD FACE BRAIN DAMAGE, STUDY WARNS
“Generally, in order for NASA to approve computers for space, the equipment needs to be 'ruggedized' – or hardened to withstand the conditions in space,"" Fernandez added. ""This physical hardening takes time, money and adds weight, so HPE took a different approach to ‘harden’ the systems with software.”
Mars is about 140 million miles away from Earth and astronauts could experience larger communication delays the closer they get to the Red Planet. It could take as much as 20 minutes for communications to reach Earth and another 20 minutes for the responses to reach astronauts, according to HPE.
HOW NASA CREWS COULD SLEEP FOR 6 MONTHS ON THE JOURNEY TOMARS
NASA’s long-term goal is to send a manned mission to Mars in the 2030s. The Spaceborne Computer aims to ensure that astronauts will have sufficient tech firepower and robust communication links when they eventually journey to Mars.
“This launch represents the first step into the next frontier of space exploration—a mission to Mars,” Fernandez told Fox News. “Mars astronauts won’t have near-instant access to high performance computing like those in low-earth orbit do.”
Estimates of a Mars journey’s duration range from six months to a year.
“Having a supercomputer onboard the spacecraft will allow our deep space explorers to access the data they need to meet any challenge in real time,” said Fernandez. “But first we need to figure out how to make a supercomputer function flawlessly in orbit. That’s what we aim to research through this experiment.”",0
"You would have to be living in a complete dream world if you still think that the mainstream media is unbiased. Maybe you grew up in the age of a dependable nightly news, but unfortunately, that has all passed. The old school networks that you remember watching are now a whole lot of sell outs, supporting the liberal agenda and willing to do anything to push you to that side.
We’ve been aware that the brainwashing has been going on, but you may not be aware until now, just how much of it was going on. Many online news networks, such as this one, have begun to question every single well-placed word that comes out of the mouths of the liberal media. Framing the facts in a way that supports your agenda is a bit underhanded, but not exactly prosecutable activity.
Somewhere along the way, someone began to wonder what would happen if we actually questioned some of the major network claims, out loud, chasing down their sources. Turns out, the layers of “journalistic integrity” and “protecting sources” were just another name for finding ways to lie about people in the Trump White House.
Check out what Breitbart News found out about CNN’s supposed groundbreaking story about Trump advisor (and son-in-law) Jared Kushner.
“CNN has admitted it printed what President Donald Trump calls ‘very fake news’ and retracted a demonstrably inaccurate hit piece on the President and his allies after a Breitbart News investigation uncovered significant inaccuracies and flaws in CNN’s work.
‘On June 22, 2017, CNN.com published a story connecting Anthony Scaramucci with investigations into the Russian Direct Investment Fund,’ CNN said in a statement late Friday night. ‘That story did not meet CNN’s editorial standards and has been retracted. Links to the story have been disabled. CNN apologizes to Mr. Scaramucci.’
The statement was sent out very late Friday evening on CNN’s Twitter account.
The retraction is a complete cave by a network that is notorious for trying to pick fights with President Trump and his allies. President Trump has identified CNN as a “very fake news” network. It comes on the heels of Breitbart News reporting on the inaccurate CNN hit piece, citing senior administration officials and sources close to Senate GOP leadership.
The thrust of CNN’s inaccurate piece, which is no longer available online, was a demonstrably untrue allegation that the Senate Intelligence Committee and Treasury Department were probing a Russian investment fund with ties to senior Trump allies like Anthony Scaramucci.
‘The source said the Senate intelligence committee is investigating the Russian fund in connection with its examination of discussions between White House adviser Jared Kushner and the head of a prominent Russian bank. The bank, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, oversees the fund, which has ties to several Trump advisers. Both the bank and the fund have been covered since 2014 by sanctions restricting U. S. business dealings.’
But that was not all that was wrong with the fake news piece from CNN. The CNN report continued:
‘Separately, Steve Mnuchin, now Treasury Secretary, said in a January letter that he would look into the Jan. 16 meeting between the fund’s chief executive and Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the transition team’s executive committee and a fundraiser and adviser for Trump’s presidential campaign. At the time, Mnuchin had not yet been confirmed as Treasury Secretary. The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for an update. Two Democratic senators had asked Treasury to investigate whether Scaramucci promised to lift sanctions — a policy shift that would help the fund attract more international investment to Russia.’
It turns out, as Breitbart News noted in the original investigation, that the two Democrats who pushed for the probe of Scaramucci’s supposed “meeting” with the investment fund executive—which was not really a meeting—were Sens. Ben Cardin (D-MD) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Scaramucci debunked the CNN fake news report in his original quote to the network, detailing how there was no such meeting to begin with.
CNN originally wrote, in the now retracted inaccurate hit piece:
‘Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, minimized his January meeting with [Kirill] Dmitriev in the resort town of Davos, Switzerland, at the celebrated annual gathering of the World Economic Forum. Scaramucci had met Dmitriev at previous Davos meetings, although at the gathering in January, Scaramucci was expecting to be named White House liaison to the business community.’
CNN also wrote that Scaramucci told the network in an email that Dmitriev “came over to say hello in a restaurant, and I was cordial. There is nothing there.”
The idea that the Treasury Department is investigating this is also completely baseless, as Breitbart News reported. “The matter has been reviewed and determined to be without merit,” a senior administration official told Breitbart News.
The inaccurate piece remained online for nearly an entire day, despite Breitbart News’s earlier inquiries to CNN about it. It was not until long after Breitbart News published its exposé on the fake news piece from CNN, hours later, that CNN finally retracted the piece and issued an “Editor’s Note” at 10:44 p.m. ET announcing the grave error. CNN’s Tweet was not until 11:50 p.m. ET.
CNN spokeswoman Emily Kuhn has not answered followup email questions as to whether reporter Thomas Frank, whose name appears on the byline, has faced any consequences for his actions—or whether he is still employed by the network. Kuhn has also not answered whether there have been any consequences that have befallen others involved in the publication of the demonstrably fake news piece, or exactly who at CNN was involved in this grave mistake.”
All of this is horrifying and slanderous and probably would make some people question a lot of what they believe if they were the kind to watch CNN. The disturbing thing is though, this is just one incident that was easily uncovered. If I had to guess, I’d say that CNN’s “editorial standard” that was broken wasn’t one of truth, but one of covering one’s tracks.
This particular issue was traceable, and CNN retracted because someone forced their hand, but what about all the times when someone like Breitbart isn’t looking? What about when they see the chance to influence popular opinion and they don’t expect to get caught? I know that freedom of speech is a precious thing, and we should protect it at all cost, but stories like this make you wonder if legal action should be taken. At some point, the American people need to take a stand. Maybe that should be through legal means, and maybe it should be through boycotting, but something has got to be done about the unrepentant lying.
Share if you think it’s time for the liars at CNN to go dark!

"Washington D. C. (November 3, 2017) —The term “fake news” continues to dominate headlines as the rise of fabricated news stories, websites and other forms of misinformation challenge the role of journalists and the facts around important civic conversations.
The PBS NewsHour Student Reporting Labs (SRL) turned to its network of teen reporters in urban and rural communities around the country to find out what young people really think about “fake news,” how it has affected their lives and the role that journalism plays in their communities.
The mosaic of voices demonstrate how a generation is navigating today’s digital ecosystem as institutions and communities search for solutions to help young people learn and understand the phenomenon of misinformation. The young voices highlighted in nearly 200 interviews shed light on how students deal with living in a world where their attention is competing with a variety of sources and the hazard of misinformation overload remains constant.
Teen reporters in 69 schools across the country revealed an awareness of a new responsibility to fact-check in the process of understanding the difference between information intended to inform and information that is intended to mislead or distort.
“If there is bad information going around, how can we make rational, informed decisions about what is true and what is not?,” said Henry Smith, a student at Royal Oak High School in Michigan.
Zoe Greenwald, a student at West Ranch High School in Santa Clarita, California said, “We spend more time in the media than any other generation ever has and with all of this information being circulated, we need to make sure that the information that is getting to the audience is factual and is correct.”
Student Reporting Labs provides middle and high schools with a unique video journalism curriculum, teacher professional development, mentorship and relationships with local public media stations to produce original stories that explore how critical national issues impact communities around the country.

"Americans were waitingon pins and needles to see if Alabama would elect a Republican or Democrat to the Senate on Tuesday. The special election was the most closely watched since the earth-shaking presidential election that landed political outsider Donald Trump in the Oval Office. His election has led to some pretty non-traditional moves by the White House and has made liberals filled with anger.
The Alabama special election was, in fact, due to President Trump’s election as well. The election was to replace Trump cabinet member and 84th Attorney General Jeff Sessions who left his Senate post to take that appointment. Republican candidate Roy Moore himself is a controversial figure because of both his career and the recent misconduct allegations that have been leveled against him.
As you probably know by now, the race has been called for the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones. As of late yesterday, news outlets across the nation had dubbed him the winner, saying that the number ofvotes not yet counted couldn’t make up the difference and give Jones a win. However, Moore is refusing to give up and concede, a move that many are calling just plain stubborn.
What the media probably isn’t telling you, is that one hugely important group of people haven’t even had their votes counted in this election. According to Breitbart News, the State of Alabama has decided to call this election without even counting the military votes:
“Republican Senate Candidate Roy Moore refused to concede the Alabama senate race on Tuesday, after his opponent Doug Jones declared victory.
‘God is always in control,’ Moore said during a short speech to supporters on election night.”
Moore’s campaign has been run on a platform of religion from the start. Moore first rose to notoriety when he stood against the 10 Commandments being removed from a courthouse in Alabama. That garnered him nationwide attention, and he has been known for that stand ever since.
During this run for office, however, Moore has been inundated with allegations of misconduct by a suspicious amount of women who seem to be just now remembering and recounting their interactions with Moore. Some have been proven to be out and out lies, and some are still being investigated, but regardless, the timing of these accusations was more than suspicions.
This race was always going to be a close one, and any votes not being counted could cause a false win. Election tampering has been a huge topic this year, and yet Democrats seem more than happy to just check this box as a win for Jones, and not give it a second thought. The men and women in the military might have a little different opinion though.
The question now is: are there enough military votes to swing the election in Moore’s direction?
“The current law in Alabama requires a mandatory recount when there is a half of a percent margin, but Moore remains 1.5 percent behind his opponent, Doug Jones, who was declared the winner with 99 percent in.”
To give a little perspective on that, current estimates have Moore about 22,000 votes behind Jones. That is 1.5%, with a potential 1% of regular votes (not the military votes in question) not having been counted yet. That means, that if the votes for Moore that haven’t been counted, plus any military votes cast in his direction make up even 1% difference, the election results could be invalidated.
If, as many suspects with elections like this, there was any misconduct on the part of Democrats to try and win this election the dirty way, and that gets out, Moore is almostassured the win in if it goes to a second round. He was close as it was, all there would need to be is a whiff of impropriety on the part of his opponent or their party to try and throw the election, and Moore would have it safely in the bag.
I waited patiently for the Lord. He inclined to me, heard my cry, brought us up out of a horrible pit out of the mirey clay and set my feet on the rock and established my goings and put a new song in our mouth.
‘Wait on God and let this process play out,’ Moore added.
A Moore staffer urged supporters to wait, noting that the military votes had yet to be counted. Moore is about 22,000 votes short, but it is uncertain whether the uncounted votes tally up to that number.
‘May God bless you as you go on, give you safe journey, and thank you for coming tonight,’ Moore concluded. ‘It’s not over and it’s going to take some time.’
The election is scheduled to be certified by the Alabama Secretary of State by Christmas, but a recount throws that result into question.”
No one knows what God’s will is for this election, and as it turns out, we might not yet know what the will of the good people of Alabama is either. It’s a sad day when we carry on with our election, ignoring those who can’t be home to vote because they’re out fighting for our freedom. Moore won’t stand for it, and we shouldn’t either.",1
"There has never been an assault against a documentary film in the history of America like the one we’ve just witnessed over the last 48 hours. The entire mainstream media waged a coordinated, simultaneous attack against the Tribeca Film Festival to censor a film none of them had even seen.
That film, of course, is called VAXXED: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe, and it documents the admission of the CDC’s Dr. William Thompson, who admitted taking part in a massive scientific fraud to conceal the truth about vaccines causing autism.
This is the first time in the history of film and media that the totality of the media establishment has condemned a film that none of them have ever viewed, desperately trying to make sure no American ever witnesses the hour and a half of film footage that is now “forbidden” to be viewed in a nation founded on free speech.
A statement has been posted on the VAXXED documentary website:
It is our understanding that persons from an organization affiliated with the festival have made unspecified allegations against the film – claims that we were given no opportunity to challenge or redress. We were denied due process.
We have just witnessed yet another example of the power of corporate interests censoring free speech, art, and truth.
Tribeca’s action will not succeed in denying the world access to the truth behind the film Vaxxed.
Robert De Niro was on a phone call before all this happened
Natural News can now report that Robert De Niro and his wife spoke directly with U. S. Congressman Bill Posey for approximately one hour on Friday, during which De Niro was given numerous assurances by Congressman Posey that the CDC whistleblower, Dr. William Thompson, really did confess to taking part in massive scientific fraud to conceal the links between vaccines and autism. It was based in part on this assurance that De Niro originally backed the film’s screening at Tribeca.
But hours later, somebody got to De Niro. Somebody powerful and connected whom we believe threatened Robert De Niro into silence. This mysterious conversation has not been revealed. De Niro has not released the names of those from the “scientific community” who threatened him, nor have the VAXXED filmmakers been offered any ability to respond to whatever accusations may have been falsely leveled against the film.
Total secrecy: Who got to De Niro, and what threats were made against him?
The silencing of VAXXED, in other words, was carried out with the same secrecy under which the entire vaccine industry operates. There is zero transparency, no due process, no discussion and no debate. Robert De Niro may have even been death threated by the vaccine establishment — an industry already steeped in the maiming and murdering of children worldwide. To silence this powerful film, they would stop at nothing… not even threatening Robert De Niro with destroying his professional career or possibly his life or family.
This is the vaccine mafia at work: Threatening people into silence, censoring a powerful documentary, leveling secret accusations in secret meetings, all while ridiculously claiming they alone have a monopoly on scientific truth which can never be challenged, debated or even questioned by anyone.
The mainstream media just committed credibility suicide… everybody knows they’re covering up the truth about vaccines
In the coverage of all this, we just witnessed the mainstream media committing CREDIBILITY SUICIDE. The entire media just followed in the footsteps of North Korea or Communist China, ordering a film festival to censor a documentary that’s so powerful, it threatens the cascade of lies propping up the fraudulent vaccine industry and all its hidden truths (that are about to be exposed).
The same Tribeca Film Festival that happily previewed films like “37 USES FOR A DEAD SHEEP” and “TICKED-OFF TRANNIES WITH KNIVES” has decided that the VAXXED documentary is too dangerous for the public to be allowed to view. But this was not a decision reached with rationality and truth: It was arrived at via the process of media totalitarianism — intimidation and threats aimed at Robert De Niro to force him to silence this film and withdraw it from the festival.
And so for daring to support freedom of expression on this monumental issue the vaccine-pimping media has desperately tried to conceal, De Niro finds himself in a firestorm of accusations and condemnation by the very same media that also blackballed every single story about CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson.
What’s so dangerous in this film that no citizen shall be allowed to view it?
Meanwhile, every thinking American has now come to the realization that the vaccine industry is run like a MAFIA and is wholly incapable of withstanding even a single low-budget documentary that, frankly, few people would have ever heard about if not for this outrageous censorship effort. Now, the American people are asking the commonsense question: “What’s so dangerous in this VAXXED film that we aren’t allowed to see it?”
Does the film show people being beheaded by terrorists in bloody machete scenes? Nope, for that you have to watch CNN and other mainstream media outlets.
Does the film feature lunatic quacks spouting total nonsense and gobbledygook? Nope, because if it did, the vaccine industry would want EVERYONE to watch it!
Does the film fabricate total lies and present them as truth? Nope, to see that, you have to watch all the leftist Hollywood revisionist history films like “TRUTH” (which is full of lies, paradoxically).
VAXXED, it turns out, is dangerous because it is credible. It is being attacked and censored precisely because it threatens to crumble the great scientific Berlin Wall of the vaccine industry… an industry built almost entirely on lies, cover-ups, censorship and systematic intimidation.
In fact, all this is on full display right now as you watch this story unfold. The media obediently attacks De Niro while vaccine totalitarians demand absolute censorship of a film they’ve never even seen. They can’t name in particular statement in the film that’s dangerous or false; they are attacking the entire film by essentially demanding that no questions ever be allowed to be asked about vaccine safety. Just the mere existence of the film is, all by itself, a serious threat to the entire vaccine industry.
All this, of course, is nothing short of “scientific intolerance” and cognitive bigotry on parade. For the vaccine industry to even claim that its products are backed by “science” is wholly laughable. Real science, as everyone knows, is unafraid of scrutiny and debate. Real science welcomes debate because real science can defend itself. Any industry claiming to have “science” on its side which is simultaneously terrified of a scientific discussion isn’t based on science at all.
We are now living in a scientific dictatorship run by the very same corporations that are systematically poisoning our children
If you ever needed a reason to see the VAXXED documentary, you now have the best reason of all: This is the film that you’re never supposed to be allowed to witness with your own eyes.
In a film industry filled with wanton violence, on-screen rapings, beheadings, bloody war scenes and scenes of torture, the single most dangerous film you’re not allowed to see is one that presents an idea.
That idea is based on a simple scientific truth about vaccine dangers, and it’s considered so dangerous to the vaccine establishment that it must be banned at all costs, even if it means threatening Robert De Niro with being destroyed or perhaps even physically harmed.
When the vaccine industry resorts to outright censorship and intimidation tactics against film organizers, you know they have something extremely damning to hide. It’s so damning that the mere utterance of a few words in the film apparently threatens to destroy the entire cesspool of lies upon which the vaccine industry was built. Words of truth are so dangerous to the vaccine industry that all such words must never be uttered on film, lest people wake up to the reality that their own children are being systematically poisoned, maimed and killed — knowingly! — by the vaccine industry and its toxic interventions.
Remember: If they can get to Robert De Niro, formerly a champion of free speech and freedom of expression, they will go after anyone and attempt anything that it takes. If they have to call in bomb threats against theaters to have them evacuated, that’s exactly what the vaccine industry will do. If they have to threaten film festival producers with murder — or threaten their families with bodily harm — they’ll do that, too. There is no tactic outside the bounds of an industry that already engages in the widespread maiming and murder of children. If they will kill your child with their vaccines, in other words, they’ll think nothing of threatening a guy like Robert De Niro to get him to participate in their cover-up.
Follow Natural News for breaking news update on all this. I am in direct touch with the film producers, and I am being kept informed of next steps in this epic battle for free speech and scientific truth.

"In large white letters against a navy background, the sloganon the campaign mailers made clear their objective: “MAKE EDISON GREAT AGAIN.”
Photos of two Edison, N. J., school board candidates — Jerry Shi and Falguni Patel — flanked the all-caps text, styled to mimic the “Make America Great Again” campaign posters used by President Trump.
Both Shi and Patel are of Asian descent. And both, on the fliers, have the word “DEPORT” stamped beneath their pictures.
The postcards targeting the school board candidates have been arriving in the mailboxes of Edison residents this week, just days before the town’s elections on Tuesday. They have provoked outragefor their blatant racism— and also sparked questions about how and where they originated.
Patel, a Democratic committeewoman who is running for a public office for the first time,told N. J. 1015 Radiothat some residents may not have embraced her as she was campaigning, but that she was shocked by the postcards’ outright racism.
“I’m obviously disgusted by it, to say the least,” Patel told the radio station. “I was born and raised in New Jersey. To see the word ‘deport’ on my picture — where are you going to deport me to? Really, it’s just outrageous.”
[Middle school student confessed to throwing wooden block at Trump’s motorcade, authorities say]
Edison Township is the fifth largest municipal area in New Jersey and one of its most diverse. Of the town’s nearly 100,000 residents, more than 43 percent are Asian, according to the 2010 U. S. Census.
Edison Mayor Thomas Lankey said Thursday he had notified law enforcement of the matter and vowed to expose whoever was behind the mailers, which he called “vile” and “racist.”
“Our community proudly embraces our ethnic, cultural and religious diversity,” Lankey, a Democrat, said in an email statement. “This despicable mailer, from an unidentified source, contains the Trump-Republican sentiments that Edison’s Republican mayoral challenger and some of his supporters have chosen to embrace. This mailer appears to be an act of desperation meant to misdirect and confuse voters.”
Keith Hahn, a Republican who is running against Lankey for mayor, also denounced the fliers.
“It’s shameful and disgraceful,” Hahn toldThe Washington Post. “This flier is nothing more than a political stunt to incite racial tension.”
The message on the postcards is unambiguous.
“Stop Jerry Shi & Falguni Patel From taking over our School Board,” the mailers state on the front.“The Chinese and Indians are taking over our town! Chinese school! Indian school! Cricket fields! Enough is Enough!!”
Shi and Patel issued a joint statement late Thursday afternoon, saying the people who sent the fliers should be held accountable, but that they wanted to continue focusing on their campaigns.
“We decided to run for the Edison Board of Education so we can improve educational opportunities for all the students of Edison, this is the only reason we got involved,” the statement said. “Edison is a wonderful community full of amazing people of all backgrounds, this is our strength. So, we will not be distracted by these unfortunate attacks. They are un-American and not the Edison we know.”
Shi is one of two incumbents running for one of nine seats on the school board for Edison Township Public Schools, while Patel is one of seven challengers. It is unclear why the two were targeted in the fliers, as the field of candidates includes other minorities as well.
[School district apologizes after students told ‘Make America Great Again’ shirts not allowed in class]
At least onelawmakerand national organization outside of New Jersey weighed in on the matter Thursday.Edison is a hub for the area’s large Indian-American community, saidSonny Chatrath, a resident of Freehold Township, N. J., about 25 miles away.
“Edison is like where pretty much everybody goes for [Indian] grocery shopping,” Chatrath said. “If there’s an event and you don’t have Indian clothes, you would rush to Edison because there are so many Indian stores there.”
Chatrath said a friend living in Edison posted a picture of the postcard their family had received in the mail Wednesday. Shortly after, several others followed suit.Shocked, Chatrath tweeted the image out, tagging as many politicians and news outlets as he could.
“They were pretty much all spooked out,” Chatrath said, of those who had received the postcards. He said he was distributing the image to the news media even though he doesn’t live in Edison because many who received the postcard did not want to draw attention to themselves. “The political climate is so volatile right now ... I just hope thatwho is perpetrating all this is apprehended soon because this should not go out of hand.”

"The free market victories against the sleazy biotech industry are coming at a rapid pace now, and the latest announcement is a real game changer: Chipotle Mexican Grill has outright rejected all GMOs and, as of today, is now serving all non-GMO ingredients in its foods.
“When it comes to our food, genetically modified ingredients don’t make the cut,” says an official announcement on the Chipotle website. “…The food we serve should be made with ingredients raised with care for animals, farmers, and the environment. We’re doubtful that the GMO ingredients that used to be in our food meet these criteria.”
The fighting words from Steve Ells very closely mirror the clean food mantra that Natural News has been advocating for years. He says, quoted in the New York Times:
This is another step toward the visions we have of changing the way people think about and eat fast food… Just because food is served fast doesn’t mean it has to be made with cheap raw ingredients, highly processed with preservatives and fillers and stabilizers and artificial colors and flavors.
Well said, Steve. You get it. Your customers get it. Your shareholders might even get it, too: people want clean food, transparent supply lines, ethical treatment of animals and no GMOs!
“While some studies have shown GMOs to be safe, most of this research was funded by companies that sell GMO seeds and did not evaluate long-term effects,” says the Chipotle website. “Evidence suggests that GMOs engineered to produce pesticides or withstand powerful chemical herbicides damage beneficial insect populations and create herbicide resistant super-weeds.”
For the first time, Natural News publicly endorses the leadership of a fast food restaurant chain
With this announcement, Chipotle makes history. It is the first fast food chain in the world to outright reject GMOs in a very public manner, making its stance a feature of its food offerings.
For this reason, Natural News is now publicly endorsing the leadership and clean food vision of the Chipotle restaurant chain, honoring the courage and pioneering spirit of this chain in staking out new territory in the clean food movement.
I don’t normally eat at fast food chains, but I’m now going to make it a point to visit a Chipotle soon and check out what they have to offer. If you happen to see me chowing down at a Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas, don’t be surprised… (and yeah, it’s totally cool to say hi!)
Why switching to 100% non-GMO is a remarkable achievement
In order to help you appreciate the difficulty of going 100% non-GMO, allow me to share some of what’s involved in this. I’m qualified to share this because I’m intimately involved in the product sourcing, certification and laboratory testing of raw materials for products sold via the Natural News Store. We are certified organic and GMP-compliant (FDA rules). I’m also the lab science director of the Natural News Forensic Food Lab, which is in the process of achieving ISO 17025 accreditation.
Sourcing non-GMO ingredients requires a tremendous supply line effort involving non-GMO certification and documentation, complex raw materials acquisition logistics, and laboratory testing of raw materials to ensure they are indeed free of genetically engineered ingredients. None of this is easy to accomplish, and it all requires a concerted effort (and additional cost).
“Ridding the supply chain of genetically altered components is difficult,” reports the New York Times. “They lurk in baking powder, cornstarch and a variety of ingredients used as preservatives, coloring agents and added vitamins, as well as in commodities like canola and soy oils, corn meal and sugar.”
It’s surprising to even see this printed in the New York Times, but it’s also very welcomed. Indeed, the NYT is correct on this point: GMOs are “lurking” even in many popular vitamins, protein powders and some superfoods! Almost anything made from corn — maltodextrin, corn starch, corn syrup and even ascorbic acid — is largely derived from genetically engineered corn.
That’s why sourcing foods made without GMOs is no walk in the park. It adds complexity and cost to the sourcing of those foods, and at times it can cause supply line shortages. On the flip side, however, it also creates enormous profit opportunities for farmers who wish to grow non-GMO foods. The demand for non-GMO crops is now at an all-time high in America, and more and more farmers and learning that they can earn far more revenue by ditching biotech seeds and growing organic or non-GMO crops instead.
The timing of this announcement by Chipotle is notable, as it coincides with McDonald’s declaring another miserable quarter of falling revenues and plummeting market share. McDonald’s is in desperation mode, scrambling to try to figure out why fewer and fewer people want to eat its factory-processed, genetically modified, artificially-flavored “fake foods.” (Is that a Chicken McNugget, or a tiny scrubbing sponge for my toilet?)
The idea that consumers might be informed enough to make holistic choices about food ingredients, food supply lines, the ethical treatment of animals and even the ecological costs of certain ingredients (such as palm oil) seems to absolutely baffle McDonald’s executives. They appear to be stuck in the 1950’s, believing that food marketing is all about social engineering — children’s playgrounds and emotional marketing slogans — rather than the food itself.
What McDonald’s has yet to realize is that food awareness is skyrocketing everywhere, in large thanks to the very same independent media outlets that McDonald’s can’t control (like Natural News). With independent organizations like Natural News now owning and operating its own high-level food forensics laboratories, the scrutiny of food can no longer be controlled by corporations doing things like pressuring universities or the FDA to remain silent about food toxins and contaminants.
In other words, the age of independent laboratory scrutiny of foods is now upon us… and food transparency will be forced into the open, even as fast food corporations like McDonald’s would likely prefer to keep their food composition a secret. Imagine what will happen when independent labs across the alternative media universe upgrade their laboratories to test for pesticides, hormones or even glyphosate contamination! At that point, factory food companies like McDonald’s will have their full chemical composition publicly revealed for the entire world to see. And it won’t take long for consumers to see why restaurants like Chipotle are a far healthier choice.
Watch the sleazebags of biotech now attack Chipotle
Now that Chipotle has taken a courageous and game-changing stance against GMOs, we’re all going to get to enjoy the entertainment of watching the “biotech sleazebag brigade” roll out its contrived attacks on Chipotle and anyone who endorses them.
These attacks will of course be staged by the so-called “Monsanto Discredit Bureau” which has now been utterly exposed and revealed to be a group of quackpot criminals and fraudsters, such as the felony criminal doctor running the American Council on Science and Health, an astroturfing corporate front group that was behind the recent attempt to smear Doctor Oz.
Biotech smear operatives work for publications like Vox.com, Slate and the Washington Post, where defamation and character assassination attacks are routinely waged against humanity and all those who defend humanity against the mass poisoning by pesticide corporations (and GMO companies). Increasingly, no one believes the biotech smear campaigns anymore. That’s why the science editors of the Washington Post and other mainstream media outlets are increasingly seen as being propaganda mouthpieces for Monsanto and Big Pharma rather than real journalists. “Journalism,” as they say, is printing what the corporations and governments don’t want printed. Everything else is just public relations.
What almost everyone is coming to realize is that nearly every single person defending the biotech industry is a paid corporate shill. Take a look at former Forbes.com writer Jon Entine, for example, who Natural News exhaustively exposed as being a violent wife abuser, according to these court documents. He was a key author for the ACSH, writing a booklet that ridiculously tried to claim atrazine was environmentally safe.
People who try to defend glyphosate, GMOs, atrazine, pesticides and mercury in vaccines only discredit themselves. The public is waking up, and they aren’t stupid. They know that GMOs are toxic, glyphosate is destructive to the environment, mercury in vaccines causes harm to children and, above all, corporations and the mainstream media are lying to them.
ACTION ITEM: Visit Chipotle this week and tell them why!
To celebrate this mass awakening, I’m now suggesting that everybody rush out to Chipotle this week and enjoy a non-GMO meal there. While you’re there, ask to speak to the manager of the restaurant and tell them you are a customer because of their rejection of GMOs.
Let ’em know as long as they take a leadership position in clean food, you will continue to reward them with your business. Vote with your dollars. Punish the poison-pushing corporations like McDonald’s, Kellogg’s and General Mills by simply denying them your business. Reward honorable, ethical companies like Chipotle, Nature’s Path and One Degree Organic Foods by purchasing their products.
You hold the power in your hands to change the food industry one purchase at a time. In fact, your power is enormous and lasting. Exercise it NOW… and you WIN!",1

"Dan Rather's career has entered a new phase. At age 86, he's speaking to millions of people every day not at CBS where he anchored the ""Evening News"" for more than 20 years. Instead, Facebook has given him a new audience where he writes about the news of the day. Now Dan Rather also has a new book. It's a collection of personal essays called ""What Unites Us: Reflections On Patriotism."" There are chapters about inclusion, the vote and service. I asked him to read an excerpt of the first piece called ""What Is Patriotism?""
DAN RATHER: (Reading) Our founding documents contain some of the most beautiful and noble words ever put on paper. I recite them often and love them with every fiber of my being. We the people - all of us - are living together in perhaps the greatest social and governmental experiment ever conceived. We are being tested. How can we prepare ourselves for the moment? Are we up to the challenge?
SHAPIRO: Did that make you emotional just now?
RATHER: Yes and without apology.
SHAPIRO: The book does feel very personal. And in it, you acknowledge that you came of age in a very different time. And one of the things you say is that your love of country may seem anachronistic in today's more jaded world. Today it so often feels as though patriotism is used as a bludgeon to hurt political opponents. Do you think that's reversible?
RATHER: I do, though we need to look to our history at least a little. We've been through some really difficult times before as a country, and now we find ourselves in a period of seemingly chaos and havoc at the very top of the government, particularly in the executive branch. So what we've done is we've descended into extreme partisan politics and set-in-concrete ideologies. But we're better than that.
And I remind myself and try to remind others that, you know, the country as a whole is stronger than any president and that if we just lower the volume and say, let's have civil discourse and to return, yes, to our core American values, take an attitude of - listen; we agree on so much. We agree on the right to vote. We agree on the need for empathy. There are fundamental things that we agree on. So concentrate on those things. And where we have disagreement, say, OK, we disagree about these things; let's discuss them in a very civil manner. Lower the temperature, and talk to one another.
SHAPIRO: In these essays, even though your optimism comes through, your alarm comes through as well. On the subject of empathy, you say, I worry that our nation today suffers from a deficit of empathy. On the press, you say, we have more people talking about news and less original reporting. On courage, you say the nation has careened into an existential crisis. I know you describe yourself as an optimist, but do you worry that you will leave the world in worse condition than you found it?
RATHER: I do worry about that quite a bit. I recognize that my time to shape the world in even a small way is receding. But I keep coming back to one of my father's favorite words, steady. Just hold steady. Do what you can. You know, President John Kennedy - ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.
And if we just hold ourselves steady and say to ourselves, let me do something today that helps my community and helps my country, we'll begin to crawl and claw ourselves back to a more reasonable state. And that way, going forward in the 21st century, we can have a better country than we have had. And let's face it. We have had a very good country.
SHAPIRO: You left CBS under circumstances that you would not have chosen after a 2004 report about George W. Bush's military service was called into question. And in hindsight, I wonder whether you feel that now on Facebook you are able to use your voice and have an impact in a way that you would not have been able to at CBS.
RATHER: That's absolutely true - totally unexpected and one of the great surprises of my life. Look; I was at CBS News for 44 years, 24 of them in the anchor chair. CBS News was part of my identity. I mean, Dan Rather, CBS News, was just in my own mind almost my name. And when I left there under those circumstances, you know, I said to myself when it was finally over, I don't know what I'm going to do.
I still want to work. I have a passion for reporting news. But is anybody going to hire me? Can I find anything to do? But to have this social media phenomenon happen, I do find it amazing and humbling. Granted, humbling is not a word usually associated with present or past television anchor people.
RATHER: But I do feel that way. I don't profess to understand it, but I am very grateful for it. You know, one of the things that has happened to me with age - I think it may happen to quite a few people - is that I'm deeper into gratitude, humility and modesty than I've ever been. That may be damning with faint praise.
RATHER: But I have learned - I have really learned the value of it. And I will say that, you know, part of what made this book possible was the, to me, still incredible response that we've seen on social media. And I see this book ""What Unites Us"" as an extension of that spirit but one that's broader in its mandate.
SHAPIRO: Dan Rather, I know that millions of people tuned in every night to hear what you had to say, and hearing your voice will be powerful for many of them. While you have their ear, is there anything you would like to tell them today besides buy the book?
RATHER: Well, I do want to say that. Forgive me if you must. There's a lot to be concerned about, a lot to shake us. But it's an essential part of the American character to, when the pressure is greatest, when they heat is hottest, to be steady. When we were attacked by the Japanese and faced with a huge, unprecedented world war, we were steady. When 9/11 - when we were attacked at 9/11, the country pulled itself together. We were steady. So just a gentle reminder that it's very much a part of our history and a part of our national character to be steady. And now is a time when we need it as much as we ever have.

"White House chief strategist and free market advocate Steve Bannon made newslate last month by allegedly floating the idea of regulating Google and Facebook like utilities.
In a familiar refrain, three anonymous sources who were involved in discussions with Bannon supposedly revealed this development to The Intercept.
Government intervention into the private sectoris usually and generally a bad idea, but assumingthis report really reflects Bannon’s thinking, it may be worth considering given the internal and external censorship allegations engulfing Big Social, i.e., the Leftist, politically correct Silicon Valley oligarchy.
Bannon’s basic argument, as he has outlined it to people who’ve spoken with him, is that Facebook and Google have become effectively a necessity in contemporary life….
Regulating a company as a utility does not mean that the government controls it, but rather that it is much more tightly regulated in what it is able to do and prices it is able to charge.And it doesn’t mean every element of the company would be regulated in that way. For Google…it may only be the search function that would be regulated like a utility.
The Intercept added that in years past, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg actually referred to his creation as a social utility.
Earlier this week, Google fired software engineer James Damore who wrote a 10-page essay from a centrist standpoint challenging thetech giant’s far Left, diversity-at-all-costs culture, a progressive agenda that simultaneously rejects intellectual diversity. This is, of course, the same organization that creates the search algorithms upon which almost every Internet user relies.
In an interview after his termination, Damore remarked that there are lots of libertarian, conservative, and anti-social justice warrior employees in Silicon Valley but they have to keep their opinionson the down lowto maintain job security, Breitbart reported.
As Natural News has detailed in a whole series of articles (with more coming), Google critics maintain that the giant search engine hasdown-ranked independent journalismand natural medicine sites — includingNatural Newsat one point — that don’t share its progressive worldview, and is destroying their web traffic in the process.
In June 2016, WikiLeaks founderJulian Assange claimedthat Google was actively engaged in trying to help Hillary Clinton become president. In a subsequently deleted video,SourceFeddemonstratedthat Google was allegedly manipulating auto-complete search results to bury negative information about Hillary Clinton.
Last year, Facebook found itself in a scandal over censoring conservative-oriented news from its news feed. As part of the “solution,” it now relies on far-left, third-party fact checkers to determine the difference between real and fake news. “We now live in a world where Facebook has the power and authority to flag and filter out what you can and cannot read,” Natural News separately explained.
Google-owned YouTube is currently demonetizingcertain political videos, the latest being those produced by longtime Trump backersDiamond and Silk,thereby choking off a revenue stream, whichis a form of stifling free speech.
As part of an expose with the “rebels” of Google, one formerengineerusing the alias Emmett told Breitbart that “he personally witnessed efforts from leftists within Google to bias YouTube’s algorithms to push anti-PC content off the platform’s ‘related videos”recommendations…and ‘it’s ‘only a matter of time’ before Google begins to bias its search results against the Trump movement, Republicans, and right-leaning politicians.”
Twitter has also been accused of suspending the accounts of Trump supporters and others on flimsy pretexts and shadow-banning tweets favorable to the president or that run counter to the Leftist, globalist worldview.
A New York Times Op-Ed subsequently seemed to agree with the Health Ranger about Google in general, suggesting that the government may needto regulate the search engine giant like a public utility given its gatekeeping sway over web traffic and e-commerce.
Given the revelations that seem to unfold on a daily basis, class-action lawsuits against these dominantsocial media platforms may also be on the horizon. In the meantime, free-speech advocates are planning nationwide protests, (#MarchOnGoogle) at Google offices around the country.
Parenthetically, the Health Ranger developed GoodGopher.com(which, unlike Google, doesn’t spy on the user), providing uncensored search results from thousands of independent media websites.
Any form of regulation would have to be carefully crafted to avoid any infringement on the First Amendment.
That said, taking all the circumstances into account, do you think it’s time for government, as flawed as it often is, to step in and regulate Google, Facebook, and Twitter like public utilities?",1
"Cars     Perspective  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events       With the Camry, Toyota gives a lesson in how to make a car people want            Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost.

The 2018 Toyota Camry is lower, sleeker — better looking, in fact — than its predecessors, Warren Brown writes. (Toyota)    The Toyota Camry has been sold worldwide since 1982. It was introduced in the U. S. market in 1987, and it has been manufactured here since 1988 by Toyota Motor Manufacturing in Georgetown, Ky. It has been one of the best-selling automobiles in the United States since the late 1980s, continues to be a top-seller today and, based on samples of 2018 Camry models recently driven in Northern Virginia, it promises to be one of the country’s best-selling cars for many years to come. Why? It is the magic of diversity — a Japanese-sponsored car designed and engineered by Japanese and Americans, manufactured by Americans and Japanese who have shown over the decades they understand the American motoring soul better than most of their competitors. The 2018 Camry proves they haven’t lost their touch. Toyota is to be congratulated for psychologically outmaneuvering its rivals, particularly those in Detroit. When I was a young automotive journalist knocking on corporate doors in the Motor City, I was trying to figure out why General Motors, Ford and what once was Chrysler Corp. steadily were losing so much market share to Toyota, which is now the world’s largest automotive retailer. It just didn’t make sense to me. How could Detroit allow this to happen? In later years, seasoned by lots of U.S. and foreign travel, I began paying close attention to what I call the “Toyota Camry Philosophy.” It works like this and continues to be manifested in the 2018 Camry models: ●Give people cars that work well all the time. Customers don’t want to wonder if a car will start. They want to know that it will start and perform to expectations all the time. ●“Fit and finish” is more than a marketing cliche. It is a product promise. If it is good, it is likely that the whole product is good. ●Most car buyers don’t care about “prestige,” which too often is a marketing term used to justify extravagant cost for over-the-top engineering and design. Look around any highway in any country. You won’t find that many Lamborghinis. You will find Toyota Camrys almost everywhere. The 2018 Camry cars are lower, sleeker — better looking, in fact — than their predecessors. Clearly, someone at Toyota has taken seriously the criticism that previous Camry styling was dull. The new styling is not dull. It is attractive inside and out. But it is not stupid. It is not Toyota pretending to be something other than Toyota; nor is it the Camry puffing up its grille or price tag to be something other than a good, middle-income car that any gainfully employed person can enjoy and be proud of. It is a front-wheel-drive car made available in five trim levels: L, LE, SE, XSE, and XLE. Hint: Get the popularly equipped SE trim with the Toyota Safety Sense package, which gives you blind-side monitoring, lane-departure warning and other capabilities. You have a choice of two gasoline engines — a 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter, four-cylinder model and a 3.5-liter, 301-horsepower V-6. You get more oomph with the V-6, which also delivers 267 pound-feet of torque. You save more fuel with the four-cylinder engine (184 pound-feet of torque). Both engines use regular-grade gasoline. A gasoline-electric hybrid model is available — a net 208 horsepower with about 52 miles per gallon on the highway. The four-cylinder engine will give you 30 mpg on the highway, and the V-6 will give you smoother going and more pep at about 26 mpg in highway driving.     Bottom line:I jumped in and out of all of the 2018 models at the Toyota ride-and-drive event in Mount Vernon, Va. I liked them all but would recommend the SE with Toyota Safety Sense.  Ride, acceleration and handling: You won’t be disappointed — good enough in all respects for motorists who take traffic laws seriously. Handling (in the SE) was surprisingly good on curves.   Head-turning quotient: The 2018 Camry probably is the best-looking Camry ever. But it is not so different that it will turn off traditional Camry lovers.  Engines/transmission: A 2.5-liter four-cylinder and 3.5-liter V-6 are available. Also available is a gasoline-electric hybrid. The gasoline-only models get an eight-speed automatic transmission.  Capacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity ranges from 14.1 cubic feet to 15.1 cubic feet depending on trim level. Same goes for fuel tank: 14.5 gallons to 16 gallons depending on trim level. Regular-grade fuel is fine.  Real-world mileage in the Camry SE: We (assistant Victoria Manglapus and myself) averaged about 30 miles per gallon.  Safety: Standard equipment includes ventilated front disc and solid rear disc brakes; four-wheel anti-lock brake protection; emergency braking assistance; stability and traction control; pre-collision safety system; blind-spot monitoring; lane-departure warning; and side and head air bags.  Pricing: Base prices for the gasoline models range from $23,495 to $34,950. Hybrid models range from $27,000 to $32,250. Dealers are willing to bargain.",0

"Bad news for fans of the colorful novelty drink called tapioca tea, or boba tea: The sugary specialty beverage, generally milk-based and filled with chewy balls of tapioca,may also include cancer-causing chemicalsknown aspolychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs, the Daily News reports.
German researchers from theUniversity Hospital Aachenhave reportedly found traces of the carcinogenic chemical in tapioca ball samples.The tapioca was taken from an unnamed chain in northwest Germany and originated in Taiwan, according to the Daily News.
“[What we found] includes in particular styrene, acetophenone, and brominated substances that shouldn’t be in food at all,” scientist Manfred Mller, of the Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicine at the University Hospital Aachen, told German newspaper The Local, notes the AFP.
According to the EPA, PCBs belong to a broad family of man-made organic chemicals manufactured between 1929 and 1979. The chemicals still exist in the environment despite their U. S. manufacturing ban. Ranging in toxicity,PCBs have been shown to cause cancer, as well as a variety of other adverse health effects on the immune system, reproductive system, nervous system and endocrine system, the government site continues.
Bubble tea has gained widespread popularity in recent years across Europe, and Germany in particular, afteralready converting young people across North America.German McDonald’s have even begun selling the dessert beverageas part of its recently revamped McCafe menu, the Independent reports.
The cancer concerns were compounded by another public health warning, released earlier in August by the country’s German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. German authorities warned that the beverage’s hallmark gummy balls,may pose a choking risk.
“Especially with children aged up to four years, there is a risk of foreign objects accidentally entering the lungs,” said Dr. Andreas Hensel in a press release on the Institute’s website. “And that is precisely what can happen when the bubbles are sucked up through a straw.”
UPDATE:According to Taiwan’s Central News Agency, a leading manufacturer of bubble tea drink ingredients has since disputed the researchers’ claims. Wang Chun-feng, chairman of the Possmei Corp., held a press conference Tuesday from his offices in New Taipei, to defend the safety of his products. Meanwhile, an official from Taiwan’s Food and Drug Administration also refuted the German safety warnings, calling into question the authenticity of the test results.",1
"The most important thing for the mainstream media is the trust that the public puts in the information they are receiving and the trust of the public in the cable news from news networks like CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News mean everything because if people don’t trust them they won’t watch them.
Without a good trust rating, the news network loses its ratings and then stops making money.
A new poll from Rasmussen just exposed the trust ratings of the mainstream media and it is practically fatal news for the likes of CNN.
75% of Likely U. S. Voters say they watch cable news networks for their political news at least occasionally.
Among those who tune in to cable news networks at least occasionally, 42% say Fox News is the channel they generally watch, compared to 35% who turn to CNN and 19% who prefer MSNBC.
Among cable news network viewers who watch Fox News most often, 50% say they trust the political news they are getting. That compares to 43% of MSNBC viewers and just 33% who tune in mostly to CNN.
So the lying liberal mainstream media that keeps getting busted sharing false and inaccurate reports is the least trusted. Can’t say that they can be surprised. The American people are tired of CNN’s lies and back door deals with the Democrats and that is being shown that by these numbers!
Share this everywhere before the mainstream media tries to cover it up!",1
"Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, said Sunday that lawmakers want the whole story on the mission in Niger that killed four American soldiers.
""At this point we have conflicting stories. We want to be able to get the full, accurate story and get it right,"" Lankford said Sunday on CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""
While the Pentagon is looking into the details surrounding the ambush, members of Congress, including Lankford, have called for more transparency on the events surrounding the attack. Lankford said the key aspect is finding out what actually happened.
His comments came after Sen. John McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, called on the Trump administration to be more forthcoming about the details of the ambush.
""We are coequal branches of government we should be informed at all times,"" McCain said on Friday.
According to Secretary of Defense James Mattis, the soldiers killed were not expecting enemy contact at the time they were ambushed earlier this month by a group of about 50 fighters affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
Lankford called the region in which the ambush took place ""extremely unstable.""
""A lot of weapons that came out of Libya are going down into this region,"" he said. ""They're being used by Al Qaeda and ISIS-affiliated groups. We've had well over 100 U. N. troops that have been killed in Mali. It's one of the deadliest places for U.N. peacekeepers in all of the world. And so there are a lot of issues with this region.""
Lankford said it's ""extremely important"" for U. S. forces to ""stay engaged.""
""We're advising and assisting all over  the world to be able to help put down Al Qaeda, and ISIS, and other radical Islamic groups that are around the world that are seeking to terrorize not only the local communities, but as we've learned from Afghanistan it's not just an isolated region of the  world that will never come after us. Obviously they have come after us before from these isolated regions,"" Lankford said.
The details of the Niger ambush have been slow to emerge, including the military's immediate response, CBS News' David Martin has reported.
The troops were on patrol about 120 miles north of Niger's capital. The risk of enemy contact had been evaluated as very low, so they did not have the kind of air cover that would be ready for a direct-action mission, in which the troops would have been prepared for direct combat. French aircraft were the first to respond, about 30 minutes after the ambush was reported.
Pentagon officials say an American reconnaissance aircraft was in the air but not watching over the patrol. It was only called in after the ambush started.
A U. S. law enforcement official confirmed to CBS News that the FBI is now assisting the military in its investigation into theambush.",0
"ANOTHER UNHINGED LIBERAL REPORTER JUST WENT OFF DURING A PRESS BRIEFING - However this time the TRUMP administration PUSHED BACK
ANOTHER UNHINGED LIBERAL REPORTER JUST WENT OFF DURING A PRESS BRIEFING - However this time the TRUMP administration PUSHED BACK
Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was giving a press briefing Tuesday when all of a sudden a reporter decided to go off on a unhinged liberal talking point rant.
The exchange started when Brian Karem, executive editor of The “Montgomery County Sentinel decided to push back on Sarah Huckabee’s claims that the news media had reported fake news in regards to the supposedAnthony Scaramucci Russia links.
SARAH – “If we make the slightest mistake, the slightest word is off, it is just an absolute tirade from a lot of people in this room, but news outlets get to go on, day after day, and cite unnamed sources, use stories without sources,”
BRIAN –“Dammit! Come on! You’re inflaming everybody right here, right now with those words, This administration has done that as well. Why in the name of heavens, If we don’t get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not read us,You have been elected to serve for four years at least. There’s no option other than that.”
Sanders disagreed with Karem’s outburst, though. “I think if anything has been inflamed it’s the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media,” she retorted. “And I think it is outrageous of you to accuse me of inflaming a story when I was simply trying to answer [a reporter’s] question.”
Democrats, progressive liberals, fake news media, and celebrities – they’re all losing their shit over every little thing PresidentTrump says and does.

"The future of Fox News is uncertain as one of Sean Hannity’s biggest fears comes true.
It was announced yesterday that Fox News stalwart and co-president Bill Shine is being forced to resign as the network attempts to restructure. (via Breitbart)
Sean Hannity warned about the potential firing of Shine in a tweet last week. He said if Shine leaves, it would be “the total end of the FNC as we know it. Done.”
Bill Shine was ousted one week after television giant Bill O’Reilly resigned.
Sean Hannity and Bill Shine have been longtime friends, and both have worked for Fox News since the cable channel started in October 1996.
Shine was a producer on the show Hannity and Colmes, which was later replaced by Hannity’s solo show in 2008 in the same time slot.
Shine proved himself as a capable producer and was able to work his way up in the company to become the deputy to Roger Ailes, the former CEO.
The firings of O’Reilly, and now Shine, prove that no matter how successful you are, you are never safe from political sabotage. Shine is being asked to aid in the transition to a new president.
It has been reported that the firings at Fox News are occurring as Rupert Murdoch’s sons are taking over the project their father started over 20 years ago. Fox News is the most-watched cable network, and O’Reilly was the most-watched anchor in the history of cable news.
However, Murdoch’s liberal sons are hoping to change the format to fit their ideology. The sons desire to shift their content to be more like CNN, and are hoping to hire Jeff Zucker, the current president of CNN, to replace Bill Shine.
Liberal ideology cannot survive the scrutiny of criticism, and left-wing elites are attempt to gain complete control of the media landscape.
It took 20 years to build the most successful cable news channel in history, and only two weeks to destroy it.",1
"The tiny nation of Singapore now has the most powerful passport in the world.
According to thePassport Index, which tabulates the number of countries that holders of passports can enter either visa-free or by gaining a visa on arrival, holders of the Asian city-state’s travel documents can cross borders most smoothly. TheNo. 1 spot comes after a recent decision by Paraguay to remove visa requirements for those carrying Singapore’s passport, meaning 159 countries can now be easily visited.
The index, which is an online tool that ranks the world's passports by their cross-border ease of access, was developed by Canada-based international residence and citizenship advisory firm Arton Capital.
In a statement, Philippe May, managing director of Arton Capital’s Singapore office, said the ranking “is a testament of Singapore’s inclusive diplomatic relations and effective foreign policy.”
Until Paraguay’s decision, Singapore, which is the first Asian nation to head the rankings, was tied withGermany with a score of 158. Germany is now in second place, followed by Sweden and South Korea at 157.
Meanwhile, the index brought bad news for American passport holders. According to Arton Capital, since President Trump took office, Americans have becomeless welcome across the globe, withTurkey and the Central African Republic beingthe most recent nations torevokevisa-free status, leaving the U.

"The Vegas shooting has been one of the most mysterious events in modern history. We know so little about the shooter. We don’t know his motives, and he didn’t seem to have any mental problems before the event. However, Ann Coulter exposed why NBC is lying or at least have no idea what they are talking about, when they talk about Stephen Paddock’s career.
“Reputedly serious news organizations are claiming that he made a living playing video poker. That’s like claiming someone made a living smoking crack. The media are either doing PR for the gambling industry or they don’t want anyone considering the possibility that Paddock was using gambling to launder money,” wrote Coulter.
“NBC News reports, with a straight face: “Las Vegas gunman earned millions as a gambler.” A Los Angeles Times article is headlined, “In the solitary world of video poker, Stephen Paddock knew how to win.” The story says that Paddock’s gambling “was at least a steady income over a period of years,” she wrote.
“I don’t know all the ins and outs of Paddock’s life, but that’s a lie,” she wrote.
She explained how it is impossible to make a living out of playing video poker, because it is set up to have you lose. That is the reason casino owners make millions. “The New York Times explained that the “top” video poker machines pay out 99.17 percent. That’s great that Paddock was only losing cents on the dollar (if true), but it’s still losing,” explained Coulter. Read her full articlehere.",1

Bex, a young lady, gave birth to a dead baby after five months of pregnancy in an unusual incident but what happened later have shocked everyone.
Bex and her husband Martine were expecting a baby with things going fine around them. They had already arranged everything for the baby from clothes to crib and every necessary thing.
One fine day, when they visited the doctor for regular treatment, reports revealed the baby had some heart problems demanding immediate treatment even though the woman was just five months pregnant. Doctors were shocked by the news and recommended an emergency cesarean right away
Mother Bex was reported to be fearful and doubtful about the process and to her astonishment, the baby did not cry after birth and she started screaming instead of embracing the divine moments of motherhood. There were unending screaming and a desperate hope to get her baby alive, and a miracle happened just eight minutes later even when there was no hope from the medical side.
To parent’s good luck, doctors did not leave the baby without making efforts and through electroshock treatment, managed to sustain her breath but there were chances of her brain, could have been damaged due to shocks and lack of oxygen.
The doctors placed baby in an incubator at minimum temperature for four days where parents could not listen to any voice of her, but they were hopeful for getting their daughter alive.
They named her Wilow and she managed to survive even after such complication.
Bex told that she did not cry for four weeks due to many tubes on her body that might heart her throat.
Now it’s been a year and a half since the baby is growing normally with no effects on her body growth so far.
Due to the advanced treatment technologies, a number of children like Wilow are breathing.
Let’s appreciate this team of doctors who didn’t give up on trying to save the girl who was born in the 5th month of pregnancy with a heart defect. For me, it is even horrible to imagine!
I hope that she makes to see plenty of springs of her life with her parents who struggled with her.

"So now it’s WRONG to stand for the anthem? What?!?
When addressing the media after their loss on Sunday, Steelers coach, Mike Tomlin seems to have taken a swipe at the lone Steelers player — former Army Ranger and current Steelers Offensive Tackle Alejandro Villanueva’s decision to take the field and stand for the anthem.
ClashDaily reported on Alejandro Villanueva’s awesome ‘protesting the protest’ by being the lone Steeler out on the field to show respect for the anthem yesterday.
Tomlin said that it wasn’t his decision, but then said that he wanted ‘100 percent participation’ from his players.
So, in his mind, the team is united in protest or in standing for the anthem.
Tomlin appears to be disappointed in Villanueva leaving the rest of his teammates in the tunnel because ‘we live in divisive times’.
He didn’t appreciate having the team politicized — but he doesn’t respect the right of a West Point graduate, Bronze Star recipient, and veteran to honor our flag and our anthem?
Having the whole team stay in the locker room does seem (to me at least) to be a form of protest — especially since the decision wasn’t unanimous.
He’d rather have ‘100 percent participation’ as a team as a sign of ‘respect for individual beliefs’?
Tomlin basically said that ‘respect for the football team’ is more important than showing respect for the anthem.
For Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin, being “respectful of our football team” trumped the right of Steelers offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva to show respect for the national anthem.
A former Army Ranger, Villanueva was the only Steeler to break from the team’s orders and come out of the tunnel Sunday in Chicago to stand for “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Tomlin told the media that, prior to kickoff Sunday, the Steelers held a team meeting and decided, though not unanimously, to not come out of the locker room for the national anthem. Tomlin added the intent was to have his team focus on the game and not President Trump’s comments blasting players who chose to protest during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
They didn’t unanimously decide to stay in the locker room, so how can Tomlin expect players that wanted to stand for the anthem to go against what they believed to be the right course of action?
Whatever happened to freedom of conscience?
Tomlin explains that it wasn’t his decision, but he heard rumblings and had a team meeting:
“Many of them felt like something needed to be done. I asked those guys to discuss it and whatever they discussed that we have 100 percent participation or we do nothing,” Tomlin said after the game. “They discussed it for an appropriate length of time and they couldn’t come to an understanding, so they chose to remove themselves from it. They were not going to be disrespectful in the anthem so they chose not to participate, but at the same time many of them were not going to accept the words of the president.”…
…“We’re not politicians. We’re coaches and professional athletes,” Tomlin said Sunday. “If those of us or individuals choose to participate in politics in some way I’m going to be supportive of that. But when we come out of locker rooms, we come out of locker rooms to play football games.”

"As millions of skywatchers prepare to witness the first solar eclipse to cross the entire continental United States in 99 years on Monday, here's how you can watch the coast-to-coast event on CBS from home or the office or anywhere that isn't going to have a clear view of the eclipse.
You can stream CBS News eclipse coverage for free on Monday, August 21. CBSN, CBS News' 24-hour online streaming platform, will begin coverage of the solar eclipse at 12 p.m. ET, followed by a CBS Special Report from 1 p.m. ET to 3 p.m. ET. The CBS Special Report will also be streamed on CBS News' Facebook page during the celestial phenomenon.
* Will total eclipse towns be able to handle huge tourist influx?
CBS News will use the hashtag #CBSEclipse to showcase coverage from in the field and encourages viewers to safely share photos and videos from their vantage point of the solar eclipse.
A solar eclipse is when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun. The darkness is the moon's shadow. During Monday's event, its 70-mile-wide path of totality will be in full view from Oregon to South Carolina. A partial eclipse will be visible in other parts of the country.
While the coast-to-coast eclipse will surely be a once-in-a-lifetime event, experts and doctors urge caution to avoid damaging your vision.
The only safe way to look directly at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed sun is through special-purpose solar filters or hand-held solar viewers, according to NASA. Homemade filters or ordinary sunglasses are not safe for looking at the sun.
* Solar eclipse glasses: What to wear to protect your eyes
Rainbow Symphony,American Paper Optics,Thousand Oaks Optical,TSE 17are the only four retailers of eclipse glasses and solar viewers on the market certified to meet international safety standards, NASA says.
Look for glasses certified to meet theISO 12312-2international safety standard. Be sure to inspect your solar filter before the eclipse, and don't use it if it's scratched or damaged.",0
"The President of Philippines Rodrigo Duterte has announced a potential ban that would be placed on social media in the Philippines.
Duterte made this known when he was complaining about biased reports from media houses on his activities, particularly the war on drugs.
According to Duterte, these news agencies and websites are able to spread lies quickly through social media and this he said “sabotages his efforts to put the Philippines in shape”.
“I will be meeting with the Telcos and discuss on how best we could block all the social media networks from being accessed in the Philippines” – Duterte said.

"(Before It's News)Climate change will force many amphibians, mammals and birds to move to cooler areas outside their normal ranges, provided they can find space and a clear trajectory among our urban developments and growing cities.
But what are the chances for fish to survive as climate change continues to warm waters around the world?
University of Washington researchers are tackling this question in the first analysis of how vulnerable the world’s freshwater and marine fishes are to climate change. Their paper, appearing online Sept. 11 in Nature Climate Change, used physiological data to predict how nearly 3,000 fish species living in oceans and rivers will respond to warming water temperatures in different regions.
Fish species in many river systems, including the John Day River pictured, will face the challenge of coping with warmer waters in the future.

“Climate change is happening. We need tools to try to identify areas that are going to be the most at risk and try to develop plans to conserve these areas,” said lead author Lise Comte, a postdoctoral researcher in the UW’s School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. “It’s important to look at the organisms themselves as we cannot just assume they will all be equally sensitive to these changes.”
The researchers compiled data from lab experiments involving nearly 500 fish species, conducted over the past 80 years by researchers around the world. These standardized experiments measure the highest temperatures fish are able to tolerate before they die. This analysis is the first time these disparate data from lab experiments have been combined and translated to predict how fish will respond in the wild.
The researchers found that overall, sensitivity to temperature changes varied greatly between ocean-dwelling and freshwater fish. In general, marine fish in the tropics and freshwater fish in higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere were the most at risk when water temperatures warmed, the analysis showed.
This figure shows the risk that freshwater fish (top) and marine fish (bottom) could exceed their thermal limits by the year 2070. Blue indicates a low risk and red shows a high risk.

“Nowhere on Earth are fish spared from having to cope with climate change,” said senior author Julian Olden, a UW professor of aquatic and fishery sciences. “Fish have unique challenges – they either have to make rapid movements to track their temperature requirements, or they will be forced to adapt quickly.”
Using years of data — and relying on the fact that many fish species are taxonomically related and tend to share the same thermal limits — the researchers were able to predict the breaking-point temperature for close to 3,000 species. Regional patterns then emerged when those data were paired with climate-model data predicting temperature increases under climate change.
For example, fish in the tropical oceans are already living in water that is approaching the upper range of their tolerance. They might not have much wiggle room when temperatures increase slightly. By contrast, in freshwater streams in the far north, fish are accustomed to cooler water temperatures but have much less tolerance for warming waters. Since the effects of climate change are acutely felt in high latitudes, this doesn’t bode well for fish in those streams that have a small window for survivable temperatures.
Fish will either migrate, adapt or die off as temperatures continue to warm, the researchers explained. Given past evolutionary rates of critical thermal limits, it’s unlikely that fish will be able to keep up with the rate at which temperatures are increasing, Olden said. The ability to move, then, is imperative for fish that live in the most critical areas identified in this analysis.
Currently, dams and other infrastructure may block fish from getting where they might need to be in the future; fish ladders and other means to allow fish to circumvent these barriers could be more readily used, although the effectiveness of these structures is highly variable.
Additionally, actions to restore vegetation along the edges of streams and lakes can help shade and reduce water temperature for the benefit of fish.
“Fishes across the world face mounting challenges associated with climate change,” Olden said. “Looking forward, continued efforts to support conservation strategies that allow species to respond to these rapid changes are needed.”

"A former domestic policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan said “virtually all racists belong to the Republican Party” and likened conservative news sources to the Nazi propaganda organs of the 1930s.
Bruce Bartlett — who recently wrote that he “helped create the GOP tax myth” — rippedconservative news outlets and those who frequent them during a Saturday interview with MSNBC host Joy Reid.
And Reid, no fan of conservatives, appeared to appreciate her unlikely ally’s viewpoints.
“There are two silos of information,” Reid noted. “The conservative silo where they’re getting their media from one place, and then everyone else getting their media from another. So how can people sort of protect themselves if they’re inside that conservative news bubble?”
Bartlett replied that such folks “never hear many facts” and apparently don’t care if they don’t.
“Well, I don’t think they want to be protected unfortunately,” he said. “I mean, you’ve got a huge number of people in this country who get virtually all of their news from Fox, or they listen only to talk radio where you really only hear the right-wing point of view from Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity. And if they’re looking on the internet, they’re reading the Drudge Report or Breitbart. They’re in a closed loop where they never hear many facts.”
Bartlett then likened what conservative news sources disseminate to 1930s Nazi propaganda.
“They hear lies,” he continued. “And so when they hear the same lie over and over again, we know this is called the big-lie technique that Joseph Goebbels invented back in the 1930s. And unfortunately it works.”
Reid then asked Bartlett to address the notion that Republicans “cuddle up to” neo-Confederates and racists, and Bartlett didn’t disappoint. Well, he didn’t disappoint Reid at least.
“Well, you know, it’s been said many times that not all Republicans are racists, but … virtually all racists belong to the Republican party today. And I’ll make the point as well … that these people used to be Democrats. The Democrats’ party used to be the party of the South, and now the Republicans are the party of the South. And a lot of people refuse to admit that there’s been any change.”
Bartlett went on to say he feels “sorry for establishment Republicans” who “have to be silent” and are “afraid to speak out in their own party for fear of being excommunicated.”
Reid doesn’t exactly score credibility points with her bit about the two silos of information: the conservative silo and the other silo, the bastion of truth where everyone else with brain cells gets their information. This is coming from a decidedly far-left pundit who uses screen time on a news network that’s known to lean left just a tad.
And Bartlett isn’t likely to woo new social media followers from the conservative perspective — if that’s his goal — by trotting out the tired “conservatives = Nazis” jag that hasn’t earned the left-wing anything except eye rolling and endless snickers.
But then there’s his “virtually all racists belong to the Republican party today.” Does Bartlett not Google? A cursory search would’ve unearthed a few gems right off the bat.
Again, that’s just scratching the surface — a skill with which both Bartlett and Reid seem intimately familiar.",0
"BAD News For 3 Anti-Trump Judges Who Allowed Obama To Wiretap, After Trump Finds BIG Secret They Hid

He is based in the city of Brussels in Belgium. He was formerly a programme presenter and correspondent for BBC News, presenting the Liquid News programme on BBC News 24 channel (now BBC News Channel) and Entertainment Correspondent for the BBC Six O'Clock News (now BBC News at 6). He became urope Correspondent in September 2011. Robert was educated at Highgate School, then a boys' independent school, in the Highgate, London, followed by the University of Bristol, where he studied history. He then studied for a postgraduate degree in journalism at the Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies in Cardiff. Robert spent several years at the BBC, mainly as a correspondent for BBC News but also as chief reporter on BBC Choice's entertainment news show Liquid News.[2] It was Robert who discovered the body of presenter Christopher Price after he died from a rare brain infection in 2002.[3] Following the end of Liquid News, Robert went on to present The Morning Show, a shortlived daytime show on BBC One with the Pop Idol judge Nicki Chapman, in 2003,[4] but that was cancelled after poor viewing figures. Robert joined Sky News in January 2005 as a special correspondent and reported on Live at Five and the former show, The Sky Report, filming a series of undercover reports including one featuring the controversial Kansas preacher Fred Phelps.

"We’ve all grown weary of FBI Director James Comey’s antics lately, as the elected official continues to play politics rather than simply doing his damn job. This was evidenced recently as he went along with the left’s narrative of a “collusion” between Trump and the Russians while under oath, even though there still remains zero evidence to back up this ridiculous nonsense. Well now in a sick story just making headlines, a young teenage sexual abuse victim is going public with the highly disturbing that that happened to her last year when the ‘Weinergate’ scandal was rocking Hillary Clinton’s campaign that’s sure to put Comey’s name on America’s $h*tlist even further.
For whatever reason, disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner just can’t stop snapping pics of his junk and sending it to underage girls. His latest victim was a 15-year-old girl that Weiner hadpreyed upon, knowing full-well that the girl was udnerage and still in high school. But not long after enduring being targetedby a nasty Weiner, she wasabusedyet again after what FBI Director James Comey did to her throughout the ‘Weinergate’ scandal. In a scathing letter, the teen said that Comey “victimized” her and through his reckless actions, “helped the abuse at the hands of Anthony Weiner to continue.”
After grilling the teenager for7 several long hours over the horrifying ordeal, rather than protecting her identity, Comey they released her name to the press, where she then became the target of their incessant requests for information. She was then the target of vicious attacks, having to relive the embarrassing ordeal over and over. Check out her scathing letter, which is now starting to go viral:
I am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators.
Your letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didn’t you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me.
In your letter, you chose to use a vague approach, meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how. Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my “story.” Why couldn’t your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle?
In his “cooperation” with you and with his love of the spotlight, Anthony Weiner has given information that led to the media finding me. You have assisted him in further victimizing me on every news outlet. I can only assume that you saw an opportunity for political propaganda.
I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters’ phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election.
Anthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my “story” the goal of every reporter? When I meet with my therapist next time, she will already know what we are going to talk about before I get there by reading Friday, October 28th, 2016’s New York Times article.
I may have been Weiner’s victim, but the real story here is that I am a survivor. I am strong, intelligent, and certain that I will come out from under this nightmare, but it will not be as a result of your doing your job to protect me. I hope that by making my letter to you public, you will think about how your actions affect the victims of the crimes you are investigating. The election is important, yes, but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me, is much more important. It’s time that the FBI Director puts his victims’ rights above political views.
— Girl that lost her faith in America

Just goes to show that these slime-balls in Washington have no interest in serving the American people, but protecting their own political endeavors.

"Over 100 Photos on Instagram? Prepare To Pay A Monthly Fee in 2015. Instagram users woke up to some not so favorable news this morning as they announced they will now be charging users for space on their servers. Instagram, which was purchased by Facebook in 2012, is one of the fastest growing applications on social media. As most know, it allows video sharing, photo sharing and social networking services that allow you to share one post across several platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Tumblr.
Facebook has come under some heat with business page owners lately, as Facebook begins to charge for likes and boosts, and limits the exposure to audiences in order for business pages to spend money. Now, after acquiring Instagram, they will now be charging users who have more than 100 photos on their account.
What happens if you don’t pay? You will simply be locked out of your photos. You will only have access to your most recent 100 photos. Not only will you lose the rest of your photos, but due to the Terms of Service you agreed to when you first signed up with Instagram, they will now be the property of the Social Networking Giant.
You can look at spending $9.99 per month for 300 photos, $14.99 per month for 500 photos, or you can choose the ultimate package for $29.99 per month for unlimited photos. Unlimited video will be included for an additional $9.99 per month on either package.
Instagram says they will be rolling out this new program January 1, 2015. You have until then to save any additional photos to your computer, smart phone or tablet, or risk losing them all.
If you do not plan to sign up for this program, and only keep the free program with 100 photos, it is recommended you delete all additional photos before January 1 or they will become the property of the parent company Facebook. Read your Terms of Service agreement carefully for more details.

"“There is a big controversy happening right now, about this election particularly, regarding Facebook. There is this claim – which hasn’t really been proved, substantiated, but it’s getting pretty popular – that Facebook rigged the election because they showed fake news,” Snowden said.
“If that was true, if that was possible, and Facebook just put on fake news, and we were persuaded [by it], I think that’s actually very sad indictment of our democracy that our voters could be so easily misled,” he added.
However, fake news isn’t the biggest problem on the table, Snowden thinks: if it’s true, then “this gets into a bigger challenge, which is the lack of competition.”
Indeed, come to think of it, can we imagine a Facebook replacement?
“There seems to be no alternative to the larger services. Because of this network effect, because the first mover advantage. When you get a Google or a Facebook or Twitter in place, they never seem to leave,” Snowden said.
“The Silicon Valley desire for massive, world-eating services, the scale that takes over not only our country but all others, it’s asking us to accept a status quo where we set aside that competition in favor of scale. We should be particularly cautious about embracing this and taking this to be the case.”
And big services entail big issues, if they mess something up, too – because they are giants that impact our views and opinions.
“When one service provider makes a bad decision we all suffer for it,” Snowden said.
“To have one company that has enough power to reshape the way we think, I don’t think I need to describe how dangerous that is,” he said.
When asked if support for third party candidates had led to Trump’s win, Snowden said, “People are wondering: ‘Was that a wrong thing?’ Should they have voted for Hillary Clinton, even though they didn’t believe in her, because it could have changed the election?”
In short, his answer was no, though he also pointed to an alarming trend in world politics.
“First of all, there are a lot of studies that say third parties would not [change] the election [results]. But even if they have, I think it would be inappropriate to say that people should vote for someone they do not believe in, for someone who doesn’t represent their interests, because we are now getting into a politics that is against choice, belief, progression. You must always choose between two bad options.”
Snowden’s talk comes as Facebook – and CEO Mark Zuckerberg in particular – are under fire for allegedly spreading fake news in the run-up to the US presidential election.
Zuckerberg first brushed off the accusations, saying at a news conference last week that it was “a pretty crazy idea” that Facebook could impact the result.
He followed up with a post on Saturday, claiming, “on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic”and that it was “extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election.”
However, the company’s employees have reportedly formed “an unofficial task force to question the role their company played in promoting fake news in the lead-up to Donald Trump’s victory,” according to Buzzfeed.
A few days later, Facebook and Google said they said they were changing their advertising policies to target fake news sites.",1
"The CNN shareholders’ meeting occurred one day after agunman opened fire on GOP lawmakers at an Alexandria, Va., baseball field.
David Almasiis a shareholder of CNN’s parent company, Time Warner. He is also vice president for the National Center for Public Policy Research. Almasi said he felt compelledas a shareholder to take TW executives to task for “CNN’s contribution to the increasingly uncivil environment in Washington.”
“Mr. Bewkes, we have urged you many times to make CNN more objective,” Almasi told the CNN chief. “But bias is apparently worse than ever. As shareholders, we are concerned about the reputational risk to our investment. Time Warner, as CNN, appears to be a key player in the war against the Trump presidency.”
“Are you concerned about advertisers leaving CNN?” Almasi asked. “Will you continue to ignore appeals for objectivity at the risk to our investment in Time Warner?”
“We will recommit. I’ll do it to you now. We will makean attempt to try to be independent,” the CNN chief said in response to Almasi’s questions. “I do understand from your questions that you’re skeptical that we’re achieving that. You think we haven’t.”
“I don’t want you to be skeptical of our effort. We’re very sincere to try to achieve that. That’s what we are trying to do,” he continued. “The decision on whether we’ve failed — you’re right — will be made by the viewer.”
“But we are trying to keep it balanced and fair.I understand that you’re thinking that we haven’t succeeded, but we are still trying,” Bewkes added.
Almasi believes it’s important for the news media to promote “vigorous debate that looks at all sides.” So he took deliberate issue with CNN trying to claim that they are“balanced and fair.”
CNN claims it’s right down the middle, somewhere between the left-wing MSNBC and the more conservative-friendly Fox News Channel. But an MRC study of an entire day of CNN’s coverage shows the network spent almost all of its time covering the Trump presidency, with a heavily skewed roster of anti-Trump guests and on-air commentators.
To get a handle on CNN’s news priorities during the Trump era, a team of MRC analysts reviewed all of the cable network’s programming on Friday, May 12, starting with the 4am ET Early Start and continuing through the 11pm ET CNN Tonight with Don Lemon, a total of 20 hours of material.
After excluding commercials, teases and promos, our analysts found 13 hours, 27 minutes of actual news coverage, an average of just over 40 minutes per hour. Of that, a whopping 92 percent (12 hours, 19 minutes) was devoted to the Trump presidency, with a mere 68 minutes — a little more than three minutes per hour — devoted to all of the other news of the day.
With the exception of about 21 minutes of live coverage of a White House briefing about the President’s upcoming trip to the Middle East and a smattering of coverage of Melissa McCarthy’s parody of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer in an upcoming SNL appearance, CNN used that time to endlessly analyze the President’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, then a three-day-old story.
So with Bawkes promising to “recommit” to “an attempt to be independent” will we see changes in the future? I guess we will have to wait and see.",1
"After lengthy meetings with journalists, editors, lawyers and constitutional scholars, the Trump administration has concluded that they can fight fake news right at the source. With an executive order aimed at the FCC, Trump has ordered that the broadcast licenses of organizations that broadcast the news be revoked unless they pass the muster of a special Presidential Review Panel that will decide if they tell the truth or not.
So far, only Fox News and One America News have made the cut. All of the major networks, CNN, MSNBC and several other small outlets will not be relicensed when the new season starts this fall. A spokesman for CNN said that the test was unfair and biased and that the fact that only outlets that agree with the President are getting renewed is very telling.
Jeff Derpinger of the WHOIP agreed:
<blockquote>”It is very telling. It shows you that there is opposition to the president in the form of lies from 99% of the news outlets out there.”</blockquote>
The fake news outlets will have until August 15th to appeal and resubmit with their new format to follow the president in a positive light if they want to remain in business. Derpinger said the newspapers will be the next targets and then before long they’ll start looking into shutting down the liberals on social media that do nothing but spread lies and mimic what CNN and Rachel Maddow tell them to say all day",1

""Disinformation is probably the greatest damage that the media can do, as opinion is guided in one direction, neglecting the other part of the truth,"" he said. ""I believe that the media should be very clear, very transparent, and not fall prey — without offense, please — to the sickness of coprophilia, which is always wanting to communicate scandal, to communicate ugly things, even though they may be true.

"More and more we are learning that Hollywood is completely full of scumbags. Director Oliver Stone tried to defend Weinstein over his accusations. “I’m a believer that you wait until this thing gets to trial. I believe a man shouldn’t be condemned by a vigilante system,” tweeted Stone.
“It’s not easy what he’s going through, either. I never did business with him and I didn’t really know him. I’ve heard horror stories on everyone in the business. So, I’m not going to comment on gossip. I’ll wait and see, which is the right thing to do,” said Stone. However, as soon as Stone wrote this the sexual allegations against him came flooding in.
“When I heard about Harvey, I recalled Oliver walking past me & grabbing my boob as he walked out the front door of a party. Two of a kind!” tweeted Playboy Playmate Carrie Stevens.
“He was really cocky, had this big grin on his face like he was going to get away with something,” she said. She claimed he “reached out and…honked [her breast] like a horn.” “That’s what’s going on in Hollywood. That’s why things have to change. He’s Oliver Stone. Nobody’s going to say anything. He walked up like he was entitled to grab anything he wanted. He did it because he wanted to,” said Stevens.
Right after these allegations came in, Stone apologized for his comments on Weinstein. “I’ve been traveling for the last couple of days and wasn’t aware of all the women who came out to support the original story in the New York Times. After looking at what has been reported in many publications over the last couple of days. I’m appalled and commend the courage of the women who’ve stepped forward to report sexual abuse or rape,” said Stone.",1

Getting tough on the Taliban: Trump admin said to be urging closure of the militant group's Qatar office
After years of failed peace talks and following one of the deadliest weeks of suicide attacks on Afghan forces, the Trump administration is said to be pushing for the Taliban’s Qatar-based office to be closed down in an increasingly ironfisted approach to defeating the militant group.
The move comes at a time when the U. S. has beefed up its military strategy —deploying thousands more troops to advise and assist the Afghan soldiers, providing them with more warplanes and giving the top U.S. commander Gen. John Nicholson a greater authority to go after Taliban forces —in a quest to turn around a “stalemate” in the 16-year war against terrorism.
“The Taliban office has not been successful in achieving its purpose, namely to act as a venue to facilitate Afghan-led negotiation and reconciliation,” Amit Kumar, president of AAA International Security Consultants, told Fox News. “Rather, it is just giving dozens of Taliban representatives a place to seek refuge.”
In 2013 —with support from American, Afghan and Qatari officials —the Taliban opened its first formal workspace after being ousted from power in the U.S. military intervention in 2001 in Doha. It was designed to be a reachable location for representatives to engage in peace talks in the conflict-riddled Afghanistan.
An estimated 25 Taliban members and their families reside in, and are given free passage, in the Qatari capital. This includes five former Guantanamo Bay detainees who were released by the U.S. three years ago, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.
Trump has openly denounced the office as a failed Obama administration initiative. Subsequently, the office has come under increased scrutiny by some U.S. officials who view it as providing the insurgents with unwarranted legitimacy, a sentiment echoed by Afghan intelligence.
“The Taliban considered the Qatar office political recognition for them and they erected the Islamic Emirate flag there. The office was supposed to be about ending violence but years after opening, it is used for fundraising and running private businesses,” Sunraise Kabuli, an official from Afghanistan’s chief intelligence agency, National Directorate of Security, alleged to Fox News.
Furthermore, critics have dismissed talks as a waste of time as it is unlikely the Taliban will agree to the terms of any deal that doesn’t guarantee the release of thousands of their prisoners from Afghan jails, and a prominent degree of parliamentary representation.
“The Talibs are Pashtun nationalists and want Sharia as the rule of law,” noted author and documentarian Robert Young Pelton, who has long spent time with Taliban and other insurgent groups in Afghanistan. “They are also out to build an Islamic nation like Pakistan, and see foreign influence as negative and destructive.”
PAKISTAN OFFICIALS ADAMANT THAT 'HERO' DOCTOR WHO HELPED CAPTURE USAMA BIN LADEN REMAIN BEHIND BARS
A U.S. State Department official told Fox News to “stay tuned” in the matter, but noted that if the office does close, the announcement won’t likely come from the U.S. In a briefing earlier this month, spokesperson Heather Nauert noted that the “office” in Qatar was more just “a Taliban presence there,” and that “all of that is under consideration right now.” Ultimately, the decision to shutter their safe space would need to come from Qatar officials, even with U.S. backing and a formal request from the Afghan government.
Other experts have expressed concern that closing the office would be a grave error and that a diplomatic peace deal is the only way forward.
“If the Qatar office is closed, it would disperse Taliban and it can deteriorate the already established relations between the Afghan government and Taliban. It can also lead Taliban to close its doors for negotiations,” cautioned Afghan security analyst, Aziz Amin Ahmadzai. “It is and should be the goal of both Afghan government and its international friends to secure peace deal and bring peace to this war-torn country otherwise peace is impossible.”
And while the fate of the Qatar office is likely to be determined in the coming weeks, international governments are attempting to revive talks elsewhere without their participation. U.S. officials last week met with delegations from China, Pakistan and Afghanistan on the matter. The U.S. wants Pakistan to work harder in destroying Taliban sanctuaries in the country and exert a stronger influence in encouraging them to come to the table and lay down their arms.
But for its part, Pakistan is continuing to deny protecting militants and claim their clout on the Taliban has diminished. According to Aizaz Chaudhry, Washington's Ambassador to Pakistan, they tried twice to bring them to the table but “those attempts were scuttled,” and the buck stops with Afghan officials —not them.
“Now we are going after the Taliban, so our ability to bring them to the table has been eroded to an extent. But we believe it is a shared responsibility,” he told Fox News last month. “And most of all, it is the Afghan government which must send unambiguous messaging to the Taliban that they have more to gain from the table than the battlefield. One day they call them brothers, the next day terrorists. The Taliban does not have a global agenda, it is an Afghan-specific agenda, so it is up to the Afghan government to work out a peaceful solution.”
Nonetheless, Afghans are expressing hope that Trump’s renewed attention somehow will bring an end to what has become an almost intolerable level of bloodshed.
“Almost 15 percent of our population has been killed or disabled, almost 20 percent of Afghans have become refugees,” Kabuli added. “Can you imagine?”

"“Disinformation” by the mainstream media for decades had always been assumed, however the left always attempted to dispute that premise, until this past campaign season when “FAKE NEWS” actually became a campaign issue, as those within the mainstream media doubled down and attempted to overtly rig the news in favor of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. And almost all of the mainstream outlets including New York Times, the Washington Post, MSNBC, CBS, and ABC, “all” to some degree manipulated the news in favor of the Democratic Presidential Candidate.
However perhaps the most egregious incident took place at one of the Democratic debates, when CNN actually gave questions to one of Hillary’s surrogates before the beginning of the debate with Bernie Sanders. And of course just a few weeks ago CNN again knowingly reported a bogus story from an unreliable source, attacking President Trump.
So once again this report by one of the major players of “FAKE NEWS” the Washington Post, should be taken with a healthy dose of caution.
The “information” obtained reportedly will “deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge” and set up standards for “determining whether an alien currently residing in the United States is deportable … for having become a public charge within five years of entry.”
The article points out that the underlying goal is designed to make our U. S. Immigration policy more “merit-based,” so that those immigrants who have exceptional skill sets and can contribute to the overall benefit of the country would be welcomed, while those who burden our welfare system are kept out, or deported
Sounds harsh? And yet most common sense Americans would agree that with a $20-trillion dollar debt and with a GDP at currently 2% and where better than 95,000 Americans are out of work, and where almost 55% of young African-American youths are unemployed.
America can least afford more drag on our economy…no doubt the Washington Post article, whether it’s “FAKE NEWS” or not, most relational and reasoned individuals would first attempt to get our own “house’ in order.

"The genetically modified food industry’s biggest player, Monsanto, is reportedly set to receive $40 million in U. S. dollars worth of financial support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development according to the website bankwatch.org.
The monetary assists/bailout will be offered for contracts made by the U. S. GMO giant with medium and large farmers and distributors in countries such as Bulgaria, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine and Hungary. It was not clear in the article what impact GMO bans in places such as Hungary and Russia would have on the situation. The funds will go to companies that cannot pay for either seeds or the wide variety of agrochemicals sold by Monsanto that they had originally committed to buy butaren’table to afford.
The news is not likely to be well received by the legions of GMO Freedom activists that currently populate Europe and other affected areas. Genetically modified organisms, aka GMOs, have been linked to various negative health effects including allergies and even organ damage and cancer. Russia banned American GMO imports following a French study showing massive tumors in lab rats that consumed the corn as well as Monsanto’s Roundup, its controversial, signature weed killing chemical that has also been linked to cancer.
Monsanto GMO Bailout in Europe A Sign of Things to Come?
The announcement is also the latest in a series of events and articles showing that Monsanto is seen as “too big to fail” by powerful government interests from the U. S. to Europe even as the movement for GMO freedom seems to grow by the day.
Wikileaks earlier revealed that United States diplomats essentially work for Monsanto to push their products and seeds around the world, a company that moved from producing Agent Orange during the Vietnam War to using their chemicals and other materials to take over the seed industry. President Barack
Obama has also appointed two former top Monsanto employees, Michael Taylor and Tom Vilsack, to high-ranking food/safety positions in the U. S. government.
European activists are known to march by the thousands against GMOs, as they wish to keep their food supply free of the lab-created U. S. crops despite best attempts by the European Union and other bodies to usurp the wishes of the people. Recently, French protesters burned GM soy that had been imported as animal feed and Italian protesters burned experimental GMO trees.
The French cancer study woke up thousands of people to the likely dangers of GMO foods, but perhaps most alarming is how they are crowding out virtually all other types of crops and food in general.
The media often refuses to mention that GMOs cross contaminate all other crops nearby, ruining biodiversity and hurting organic and conventional farmers who receive higher prices for their crops if they’re certified to be non-GMO.
Many farmers have even been sued for patent infringement by Monsanto when the company’s “intellectual property” i.e. patented materials are found within their plants, materials they never wanted in the first place. The organic farmers have argued in several lawsuits that the burden to prevent cross contamination should be on Monsanto, especially since they are the ones responsible for all cross contamination in the first place.
In response to news of the GMO bailout, CEE Bankwatch, “together with 157 NGOs from all over the world, are this week sending a letter to the management of the EBR Darguing against the approval of this financial aid package for Monsanto and also calling on the bank to reassess its approach to food security, from a focus on promoting large-scale industrial farming to encouraging more sustainable, biodiversity friendly and smaller scale farms,” according to the article.",1
"This has to be the feel-good story of the week!
I think now I have seen it all. A white newspaper “fake news” reporter from Missouri has set off a barrage of controversy after he published a fake opinion piece last month attacking Missouri sheriff’s deputies for pulling him over after he made multiple traffic violations.
According to Bill Clark’s column, he was pulled over for failing to signal at a stop sign, which he does often. That in its self is not news, but since the mainstream media now makes up news we all can imagine what happened next. Clark went on to write that he was lucky he didn’t get shot and that his very life seemed to be in danger during the traffic stop. He then continued on to write that he now feels like he fully understands what minorities go through when stopped by police. Huh?
After over three million miles of driving and using my turn signals religiously, Ol’ Clark was pulled over for not signaling a right turn, giving me a chance to better understand how minority motorists feel when they are pulled over for the most trivial reason, or no reason at all.
The intersection of Grace Lane and Lake of the Woods Road carries a heavy traffic load to major subdivisions all the way south to highway 63. Cars on Grace Lane can go either left or right at Lake of the Woods, where traffic does not stop. It can be a very dangerous corner.
On one recent evening, I left my gym half a block south of the intersection and, upon reaching the stop sign, I stopped and remarked to myself that I couldn’t believe there was no traffic in either direction. There was only a car a block behind me.
My stop had been total, not rolling. I turned right and headed toward Interstate 70. Within 100 yards, red lights flashed behind me, seeming to come from nowhere. I pulled over to allow an emergency vehicle to pass, stopping in the intersection with Bull Run Drive. Then I realized the lights were for me.
I was now blocking traffic onto Bull Run, so I rolled slowly forward to a shoulder wide enough for both vehicles. The move made sense.
I’m lucky I didn’t get shot. Sirens wailed and when I stopped, two officers were out of the sheriff’s vehicle. When I reached over to turn off the radio and then take my wallet out of my pocket to produce the driver’s license and insurance card, I realized my hands were not at the top of my steering wheel. Danger lurked and official arrogance was to follow.
I had no idea why I had been stopped. I rolled down the window and when the sheriff’s deputy approached, my question was, “Why am I being stopped?”
“Because you didn’t use your turn signal back at Grace Lane.” And she added, “And you don’t move your vehicle when we stop you.”
“Hey, I was blocking a major intersection because I thought you were an emergency vehicle and traffic couldn’t move.” No answer.
After surrendering my license and insurance card, here came the lecture while the second officer stood guard. Then I asked the question: “I normally am very good about using my turn signal,” I said, realizing that the deputy had probably heard that excuse too many times before. “Tell me, just how did that infraction interfere with the flow of traffic since there was no one except you behind me? How did I endanger others? What did I do to compromise the safety of others and the flow of traffic?”
The answer, “You didn’t use your turn signal. If you don’t agree, plead “not guilty.”
Why bother? It would be me against two officers. If they said, “no turn signal,” the cost of the ticket would be increased. I said: “Give me the ticket. If you say I’m guilty, I’ll be guilty.” I felt a warning would have been sufficient.
Now I’m charged with a moving violation, though I was stopped, by the deputy’s admission. I have no idea what the fine will be because there is no listed fine for not using the turn signal. I had to call the fine collection center in Jefferson City. The service agent there couldn’t tell me the fine because they had not received a copy of the ticket a week later. You tell me how this operates.
Now a note for the deputy and her standby partner. I was not wearing a seat belt at the time and that is a more serious offense. And, when the two officers turned off their red lights and pulled back into traffic on Lake of the Woods Road, they did not turn on their left turn signal to let traffic know they were changing from the shoulder to the right traffic lane. Whatever fine I pay should be less than what these sheriff’s deputies should pay. I was at least stopped when I allegedly violated.
I can fully understand how easy it is for police to make random stops. I have a rear bumper full of liberal bumper stickers and a dent. My car is old, with 425,000 miles, which probably makes me an aging hippie with a weed habit. So why not pull me over?
I’ve just come to appreciate even more the words of those minorities when they speak of harassment and police arrogance. I had a good dose of arrogance on this evening and, in my rear view mirror, the image of the second officer out of the car, his hands ready in case I made the wrong move. My life seemed to be in danger.
I fully understand how a person can lose their respect for law officers. When you are in the shoes of the minority, you learn a lot more about their journey.
Bill Clark’s columns appear Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Reach him at 474-4510.
The day after Clark’s column was published, Boone County Sheriff Dwayne Carey saw the column and began questioning Ol’ Clark’s claims by writing a response to Clark’s lies. He wrote, in response to the column, that the Boone County Sheriff’s Department’s motto is “treat people like you would like your mother to be treated.” But in a move that completely rendered Clark’s narrative a complete lie, the Sheriff added a dashcam video of the incident.
In the video above you can clearly see Clark’s car roll through the stop sign and then turn right without signaling. The officer’s car then signals Clark to pull over as he goes through another intersection. The officer’s car siren sounds briefly before Clark’s car comes to a complete stop. The deputy then gets out of his squad car and the rest seems like your typical routine traffic violation stop without any controversy whatsoever.

"Have you ever thought about regrowing new teeth in your mouth and avoid dental implants? Dental implants are a great technology that allows us to fill the void where the tooth was taken out without having to resort to dentures or just live with the new gap, but they come with their own set of drawbacks.
Now, one researcher has made an amazing breakthrough in dental implant technology that is far superior to typical dental implants or dentures, and allows you to regrow new, real teeth in your own mouth.
Before I get into the details of how exactly you can regrow your teeth (in as little as 9 weeks), you need to be aware of the potential issues with dental implants.
Normal dental implants can be a wonderful way to functionally and aesthetically replace a lost tooth. However, like any sort of implant, there are a variety of factors that cause complications or failure of the treatment.
Here are some of the issues with dental implants:
– Dental implants are expensive.
– Dental implants run the risk of being rejected by the body as a foreign object.
– The implant may fail to fuse together properly with the jawbone.
– An infection of the gum and/or the bone around the implant. In many cases the implant must be removed.
– An inexperienced dentist can cause damage to the tissue surrounding the implant, specifically the nerves around the area.
The above issues can mean that a huge investment of both time and cash will result in nothing but disappointment and pain.
Dr. Jeremy Mao, the Edward V. Zegarelli Professor of Dental Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center, spearheaded the research leading to the discovery of this awesome new grow-your-own-tooth technology.
He has created a “scaffolding” for lost teeth that contains the body’s own stem cells, allowing for the regrowth of your own teeth, using your own DNA. This technology is the first of its kind, and offers exciting prospects for the future of dental care.
Rather than going through the lengthy process of tooth extraction and implantation—which can take the better part of a year to fully recover from—this technology allows you to grow your own natural new tooth in only 9 weeks – a fraction of the time it takes for an implant to be placed and accepted by the body as a stand-in for a tooth.
It is also a natural technology, and involves no foreign materials to replace the lost tooth.
Your body’s own stem cells go to the scaffolding and replace the tooth that was lost, and the new tooth merges with the surrounding tissue—it’s that simple, and that natural. This procedure also eliminates the need to regrow the tooth in a Petri dish and results in faster recovery time
It is not clear how soon the technology will be available but I am going to follow it as this technology can be a game changer in dentistry.
The patent on this new technology is currently pending, and assistance in its implementation as a cost effective treatment in dental clinics is still needed.
For decades, dental implants have been the best available technology for people who want to replace an extracted or lost tooth. Dr. Mao’s research allows for a better, more natural option that involves a shorter recovery time and less chance of rejection and depends on your own body rather than a foreign object.
This is exciting news for anyone who has ever worried about what they’ll do if they lose a tooth!
Another technological breakthrough that supposed to be available next year is healing small cavities without drilling!
A Japanese team has developed a groundbreaking cavity-filling method using a paste which is molecularly similar to tooth enamel. The paste bonds with the tooth without the need for drilling, saving the tooth’s owner time and pain.
However exciting these new technologies are, they are not substitute for good oral hygiene. Brushing daily using a good toothpaste and regular flossing is the best way to keep your mouth free from dental problems.
You don’t necessarily have to buy commercial toothpaste which may contain toxin potentially linked to cancer, but you can use natural alternatives like this DIY 2 ingredient toothpastes or natural coconut paste and you can even try the Ayurvedic technique of oil pulling.",1

"“Muslim refugee riots ignored in U. S. media blackout,” By Leo Hohmann, WND,
Europe’s model of multiculturalism goes up in flames
Bookstore in Stockholm suburb had its windows smashed by rock-throwing refugees. Cars were torched and buildings burned but a media blackout is in place in the U. S., which plans to step up its own importation of Muslim refugees under President Barack Obama’s recently announced plan
Sweden, seen by many American progressives as the model of multiculturalism and tolerance, has erupted into an orgy of violence as gangs of rioting immigrants took to the streets for a fifth consecutive night Tuesday in Stockholm.
The latest reports indicate the riots are now spreading to the country’s two other major cities – Gothenburg and Malmo.
Sweden, along with Germany, make up Europe’s two most generous welfare states. They are also the most welcoming of Islamic immigrants, more than a million of which have flooded into the continent this year from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and North Africa.
The unrest and destabilization in Sweden, which has received zero coverage in the U. S. media even as PresidentObama plans to ramp up his own refugee welcoming program, is exactly the type of upheaval that the global elite have planned for all of Western Europe and America, as predicted by analyst Paul McGuire in a Oct. 6 article by WND.
Hundreds of cars were torched, shops had their windows smashed, a police station was set ablaze and fire departments kept from a major blaze by rock-throwing mobs.
The globalists in charge of Europe and the United States are using Islam and Muslim refugees to “break down social cohesion all over the world,” McGuire, co-author of “The Babylon Code: Solving the Bible’s Greatest End Times Mystery,” told WND, setting the stage for mass unrest. When the violence becomes unbearable, the solution will be police-state crackdowns.
Germany has also seen increasingly violent protests and demonstrations on both sides of the refugee issue, scenes that, again, are never shown on the nightly news in America.
“They’re using refugees in Germany to take over towns and cities. And here in U. S., they’re using refugees to wage war on the social cohesion of our society. So they’re going to slam-dunk the global government, and it will be a terrorist attack or financial crisis that triggers it,” McGuire said.

"The liberal media has been pushing the narrative that Rush Limbaugh didn’t believe Hurricane Irma was really going to happen. This is completely false. But since when has that stopped the media from pushing a narrative? Rush Limbaugh spoke out against these accusations on this show.
“This is all over the place that I told people there’s no storm, that I told people you don’t have to run away from Florida, you don’t have to evacuate because I said the storm wasn’t coming. I did not say that. I didn’t say the storm is not big. I didn’t say the storm was going somewhere else,” said Limbaugh.
He did say, however, that he did not join in with the climate alarmists and group think. “I did not join in the panic. I specifically didn’t join the idea that global warming or climate change was causing this,” said Limbaugh.
He said that this recent attack against him is “one of the greatest smears of my career.” Then he went after the media for causing a panic.
“You can accomplish a lot just by creating fear and panic. You don’t need a hurricane to hit anywhere. All you need is to create the fear and panic accompanied by talk that climate change is causing hurricanes to become more frequent and bigger and more dangerous, and you create the panic, and it’s mission accomplished, agenda advanced,” said Limbaugh. Check out the video below.",1
"The governance structure used by companies such as Facebook, Alibaba and Volkswagen is going global, and not everyone is happy. Dual-class shares, as they’re known, give company founders super-sized power over their businesses even if they only hold a small slice of the stock. While the formula is popular,especially among technology firms -- it blends public shares with the private-equity model -- many investors bristle at its undemocratic nature. Proposalsby exchanges in London, Hong Kong and Singapore to allow dual classes mean they’re likely to become more common, despite complaints.
Opponents say they subvert the traditional one-share, one-vote system that’s designed to give equal treatment to all shareholders.Dual shares challenge the bedrock notion that those who provide the capital should get a say in how the company is run, by conceding that some investors (usually the founders, their families and the venture capitalists who provide seed money) matter more than others. The rest have little clout -- none at all, in the case of Snap Inc. -- though they do usually get the same amount of dividends. Facebook’s dual-class model gives company founder Mark Zuckerberg less than one percent of the social-media giant’s publicly traded stock and 60 percent of its voting rights. That’s how he could buy messaging app WhatsApp for $22 billion with little shareholder or board input.
Such shares, also known as weighted voting rights, are permitted by many bourses around the world, including in the U. S., Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Russia and Finland. Rules and formats differ.
London, Hong Kong and Singapore, all of which fear they’ll lose their status as financial hubs if they don’t allow dual classes. The U. K. regulator in February floated thepossibility of loosening its restrictions in a discussion paper on the effectiveness of its markets. Hong Kong’s exchange operator, which lost out to the New York Stock Exchange on Alibaba’s listing in 2014,is proposing to create a new trading venue to allow such structures. In Singapore,dual-class shares were included in a wider plan to remodel the economy for the next decade.
In short, because Wall Street is bagging the hottest listings. While dual-class shares once were used mostly by family-owned firms (Ford Motor Co. and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.) and media companies (the New York Times Co.), the floodgates opened in 2004 with Google’s dual-class initial public offering. The model was quickly followed by LinkedIn, Groupon, Zynga, Facebook and Fitbit. These companies’ shares are included in major indexes, tracked by big money managers.That makes it more likely that such stocks are held by mom-and-pop investors in retirement accounts.
They’re increasingly raising alarms. They see risks, including abuse of management power and discouragement of takeover offers, which can dampen share prices. They also see a slippery slope: Google, for example, went on to offer shares with no voting rights at all in 2014. In April, the Asian Corporate Governance Association, whose members include Fidelity International and Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, came out against Singapore’s dual-class plans, saying any benefits would be short-lived. In the U. S., the Council of Institutional Investors, whose members oversee more than $23 trillion, wants to bar non-voting shares from stock indexes. Still, many institutional investors end up buying shares in these companies, some of which are too big to ignore.BlackRock Inc., for example, has spoken against such share structures but is one of the largest investors in Facebook and in Google’s parent, Alphabet Inc.
Businesses with dual-class shares say they enable executives to resist the short-term expectations that often come with being publicly traded and constitute a defense against hostile takeover bids. There’s no clear, consistent proof that the shares of such firms fare better or worse.

"Bill O'Reilly was the first to get the ax at Fox News. Now, conservative news commentator Sean Hannity has been accused of misbehavin'.
Are you starting to see a pattern here?
O'Reilly's denials to the contrary, Fox News ditched the popular host of ""The O'Reilly Factor"" last week following new claims of inappropriate behavior by Fox News employees.
Fox News and O'Reilly reportedly paid $13 million to settle five sexual harassment claims since 2002 before the company decided to cut O'Reilly loose.
According to The Daily Beast, during a interview with Tulsa, Oklahoma-based radio host Pat Campbell, Debbie Schlussel ""accused Hannity of inviting her to his hotel room before and after a debate with a pro-Palestinian guest in Detroit. Schlussel said she rejected Hannity’s alleged advances and that she was never invited on his show again.""
Turns out Schlussel, an attorney, can't get her story straight now. She's denying that she was ever sexually harassed by Hannity.
LawNewz.com reported in a radio program that while Schlussel, an attorney, sticks by her ""description"" of the incident, ""Schlussel told us that she doesn’t believe what happened between the two amounted to sexual harassment by any legal definition.""
“I would never accuse him of that. Sexual harassment has a special meaning under the law, and I would never accuse him of that,” Schlussel said.
Schlussel said the incident took place in the early 2000’s when Hannity was in Detroit taping a show.
Nearly two decades after the alleged incident Schlussel decided to come forward. How convenient. Kind of like candidate Donald Trump, who faced multiple allegations of sexual harassment during the final days of his presidential campaign.
Schlussel told LawNewz that Sean Hannity “tried to get me to go back to the hotel after the show after he and his executive producer Bill Shine treated me horribly. I never thought I was sexually harassed by Sean Hannity, I thought he was weird and creepy not someone I liked.""
We're confident weird and creepy do not meet the legal standard of sexual harassment. They're more on a par with cooties and icky, both of which are not actionable offenses either.
It's beginning to look more like a case of blood in the water and the female sharks are on the prowl, searching for easy meat at Fox News.
To his credit, Hannity hit back against the ""serial harasser"" Schlussel and vowed to fight if Schlussel filed a lawsuit.
We don't think she will, because Schlussel's story doesn't have any teeth.
Please share this on Facebook if it appears there is a concerted effort to target conservative pundits at Fox News with allegations of sexual harassment.",1
"As the latest reports indicate, USAA who ousted ads from Sean Hannity’s Fox News Show this previous week has announced that they will bring the ads back.
As reported by APNews, the USAA financial services firm is bringing back the advertising on Sean Hannity’s Fox News Channel program after getting vocally bashed for its first decision, from the bulk of the military members and veterans that it works for.
The San Antonio, Texas-based company stated Tuesday, that it will also begin advertising again on other programs where it had dropped ads, in which “Hardball” and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC, and Jake Tapper’s “The Lead” on CNN.
After Hannity’s reporting on an almost forgotten conspiracy theory regarding the death of a Democratic National Committee staff member, the liberal advocacy group Media Matters this past week posted a list of his show’s advertisers — and USAA was one of the 10 who declared they are dropping the ads. Back then, the USAA stated the company’s policy was to stand aside from politically oriented shows.
However, many of USAA’s customers were immediately triggered, and all of that was topped off with the announcement that the company is advertising on different opinion shows.
“We heard concerns from many members who watch and listen to these programs,” USAA said in a statement on Tuesday. “Our goal in advertising has always been to reach members of the military community who would benefit from USAA’s well-known commitment to service. Today, the lines between news and editorial are increasingly blurred.”
Brent Bozell, president of the conservative Media Research Center, stated he wasn’t shocked by USAA’s move, “given the avalanche” of protests. His group was responsible for the conceptualization of that backlash, and stated its members gathered no less than 1,600 phone calls to USAA in the span of 48 hours.
“They did the right think in going back on that show,” he stated, “and so long as the other side isn’t participating in personal smears, they should participate on those shows, too.”

"New York, NY – Over the past 15 years many highly respected academics and experts have come forward to challenge the official narrative on the collapse of the WTC towers forwarded by the U. S. government. The official government position holds that the collapse of all three towers was due to intense heat inside of the buildings.
But a new forensic investigation into the collapse of the three World Trade Center towers on 9/11, published in Europhysics News – a highly respected European physics magazine – claims that “the evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that all three buildings were destroyed by controlled demolition.”
While many in the mainstream have attempted to label anyone questioning the official narrative as “tin foil hat” conspiracy theorist, many highly respected experts have come forward to lampoon the idea that the buildings collapsed due to the intense heat and fires following two terrorist-directed plane crashes.
The new study is the work of Steven Jones, former full professor of physics at Brigham Young University, Robert Korol, a professor emeritus of civil engineering at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, Anthony Szamboti, a mechanical design engineer with over 25 years of structural design experience in the aerospace and communications industries and Ted Walter, the director of strategy and development for Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, a nonprofit organization that today represents more than 2,500 architects and engineers.
The comprehensive study in Europhysics Magazine directly challenges the official narrative and lends to a growing body of evidence that seriously questions the veracity of the government narrative.
In 2002, the National Institute of Standards and Technology remarked that the case was exceptionally bizarre. There were no other known cases of total structural collapses in high-rise buildings caused by fires and so it is deeply unusual that it should have happened three times in the space of one day, noted NIST.
Official investigations have never been able to thoroughly and coherently explain how this might have happened and various teams tasked with examining the collapse have raised difficult questions about the veracity of the government’s story.
Perhaps most damning of all, the experts claimed that after a thorough forensic analysis of video footage of the building’s collapse, it revealed signs of a controlled implosion. Additionally, Jones has co-authored a number of papers documenting evidence of unreacted nano-thermitic material in the WTC dust.
The authors of the study note that the buildings fell with such speed and symmetry that they there was no other feasible explanation for the sudden collapse at free fall speeds – directly refuting studies that attempted to debunk the idea that the building fell without resistance. These respected experts’ new forensic analysis only adds to the growing movement of people calling for a new and impartial investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center.
Revealing the scope and breadth of public disbelief in the official government narrative surrounding the events of 9/11, even presidential candidate Jill Stein has recently called for a new investigation.",1
"A prominent figure withina Virginia school district decided to ask a simple question of Muslims in a post on her personal Facebook wall, and you’ll never guess what ended up happening as a result.
Chesapeake School Board Chairwoman Christie New Craig merely shared a meme to her personal wall last month, which she fully acknowledges, but she never made any further comments about it. However, that didn’t stop an outrage from ensuing within her community, according to PilotOnline. Craig said she wasn’t out to offend anyone with the meme, but that didn’t seem to be enough for members of the Muslim community, who are upset that a member of the school board would ever post something so horribly “offensive.”
It reads, “Muslims hate pork, beer, dogs, bikinis, Jesus, and freedom of speech. My question is, what the hell do they come to America for?”
The president of the Muslim Community of Tidewater, Mhammed Abdous, doesn’t think that Craig should have exercised her First Amendment rights in such a way, which is rather ironic, given the meme actually lists freedom of speech as one of the things Muslims hate, wouldn’t you say?
“I found it saddening and disappointing that kind of language came from someone involved in educating children,” Abdous said.
Abdous is demanding that Craig apologizes for the meme, but her problems don’t end with him. Of course, nothing Muslim-related can happen without the known terror group the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) getting involved, and they’re quite upset over Craig exercising her freedom of speech. The Washington-based branch of the group sent out news releases recently, decrying Craig’s actions and demanding the Chesapeake school district conduct a thorough investigation into the post.
In a written statement to the district, CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper didn’t mince words when expressing how he felt about it, and he accused the district of supporting “anti-Muslim bigotry” if they didn’t take swift action:
The Chesapeake Public Schools Board’s silence on this issue will inevitably be viewed as acceptance and approval of anti-Muslim bigotry. We therefore formally request that the board take up this important issue at its next meeting on Monday, September 14. The board must send a message to students and parents of all faiths and backgrounds in the district and the state that they deserve equal respect and support.
Only by addressing this issue can the board uphold its stated commitment ‘to the principle of equal opportunity for all and does not permit discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, military or veteran status, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.’
Despite the negative backlash that Craig has received, she’s offering to sit down with anybody who is concerned and have a chat. However, she’s still amazed that a Facebook post, of all things, has received so much attention.
“I merely shared it. I did not make a comment, and I’m just shocked with everything going on in our country – police officers are losing their lives, people are homeless and people don’t have jobs – that a political cartoon would cause this much stir,” Craig said, according to WAVY News.
As of this writing, Craig has retained her position with the district, which she was elected to in 2010. However, the next board meeting comes on September 28, and things could quickly go downhill for her, as I’m sure most of you already expected.
I can’t help but see the irony in this entire situation, considering what the original meme had to say. We watch daily as Muslims around the world try to limit others’ free speech rights, so that they’re not offended, then when a woman shares a meme pointing it out, Muslims step in and demand that she be punished for exercising her right to free speech.
To think, we let nearly a million of these people into the nation annually, and Barack Obama just announced that an additional 10,000 are going to be allowed in from Syria. As it is, they’re already trying to encroach on our freedoms, so imagine what it’s going to be like as their population grows.
Muslim Brats Attack Man, Realize They Messed With The Wrong Infidel [Watch]
VIDEO: Muslim Smacks Girl, Instantly Learns What She Was Hiding All Along",1
"Missouri Democratic Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal made herself infamous by calling for the assassination of President Donald Trump. Despite narrowly being fired, the pompous Democrat has most recently reignited the flames of racial tension by comparing Trump to Hitler – but she wasn’t too happy after getting a brutal surprise just a few seconds later.
There’s no arguing that some people love attention, and Chappelle-Nadal is a prime example. Of course, she made national headlines after openly calling for Trump’s assassination on Facebook but quickly deleted it, as Mad World News previously reported.
At first, she tried to remain firm while facing a major backlash, saying that she meant what she said – but the pressure for an apology kept mounting. “Whenhe apologizes for all of the statements he’s said on behalf of white supremacists and the KKK and neo-Nazis, when he apologizes,I’ll apologize,” she said, doubling down on the remarks.
However, it seems that she wasn’t prepared for the consequences. At first, Secret Service showed up to have a little chat with her. From there, her fellow State Senators said that they were actively seeking to have her officially removed from her position.
For reasons unknown, that never came to be, and the woman is still in office as a public official despite being a huge embarrassment. As if that wasn’t bad enough, Chappelle-Nadal is back at it again, this time sharing an image comparing Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler, according to IJ Review.
Chappelle-Nadal claimed she posted her race-baiting meme because she was upset over a Trump tweet stating the obvious: That the U. S. military and FEMA staffers cannot stay in Puerto Rico “forever” to help with its hurricane-relief efforts….
Maria Chappelle-Nadal told the AP the Puerto Rico crisis is “very personal” to her because hermother is from Puerto Rico. Um, okay. [Source: BizPac Review]
In the meantime, she’s not only effectively giving a big “eff you” to all the other Americans suffering from hurricanes, flooding, and fires currently, but those who have already been providing relief in Puerto Rico for weeks and would like to return home, such as first responders.
Unfortunately for Chappelle-Nadal, it wasn’t long before the backlash started to roll in again and – yes, you probably guessed it – a nasty surprise just a few seconds later. Of course, there were quite a few creative responses via Twitter that got nearly as many likes as her original post, showing just how many people she has pissed off:
However, the worst news came just a few seconds later as everyone reminded her what almost happened last time. Of course, she called for the death of a man previously, but seeing how she was already on thin ice, it wasn’t long before everyone was saying that she should have been fired the time before but really needs to get the ax right now.
Americans can only take so much, and after all, elected officials are the employees of the people. We are a country of the people, for the people, and by the people, and therefore, we control who gets to keep an elected position and who doesn’t. Even better yet, sometimes it’s not required for people to wait until the next election cycle as enough pressure on others surrounding her can force them to squeeze her out – which looks to be what is happening.
Chappelle-Nadal had a close call last time, and you’d think she would be keeping her head down these days, but that’s not the case. However, the irony here is that she wants someone else fired, but it looks like she’s actually going to be the one removed from her position because she doesn’t know when to keep her fat trap shut.",1
"Tarek El Moussa has fought many battles over the years.
The 36-year-old star of HGTV’s popular house-flipping series “Flip or Flop” has faced both thyroid and testicular cancer in 2013 after a fan noticed a lump on his neck and reached out to his show’s producers.
The viewer, who happened to be a nurse, warned El Moussa he might have cancer and should consider getting examined. The popular television personality received a diagnosis, which resulted in the removal of a malignant tumor. But just weeks later, El Moussa was diagnosed with testicular cancer.
El Moussa has since beat his cancers and is now determined to save lives. He’s teamed up with the Movember Foundation to raise awareness about men’s health, as well as encourage early cancer detection.
Fox News spoke to El Moussa about his public health ordeal and how lives can be saved:
Fox News: What was going through your mind when you realized you were going to be battling cancer again?
Tarek El Moussa: Well, actually it wasn’t again. It was at the same time! I’ll never forget the day when I found out I was also diagnosed with testicular cancer. The first thing I thought was I’m going to die and what is my family going to do? That’s how I dealt with it, but you know, the next day, I woke up and felt better and I tried to stay positive. I was just prepared to move forward and do whatever it is I needed to do to fight them and beat them.
Fox News: Testicular cancer is more private and personal in nature. Why did you choose to open up to fans?
El Moussa: I was very open with the thyroid cancer. I got a lot of messages through Instagram and Facebook where people were telling me that because of my story, they found out they had cancer because they got checked. So I may have saved some lives. And then my stepfather got diagnosed with testicular cancer, which obviously hit very close to home. When that happened, I thought it would be a good idea to create exposure, share my story and help save some lives.
Fox News: How did battling cancer twice change your life?
El Moussa: Obviously, I look at things a little bit differently, you know. Obviously, before the kids were the most important thing. But now, the only thing that matters are my children, being healthy, and being the best dad possible. Taking a set back from work, taking better care of myself, eating healthy, taking vitamins, taking more cardio exercises, hot yoga, things like that.
Fox News: Tell us about this movement happening this month.
El Moussa: The Movember Foundation is obviously really, really cool. They promote Movember, which is when you grow a moustache to raise awareness on men’s health, but not everybody can grow moustaches! So there’s the MOVE campaign, which tells people to get out there and move. Get out there, improve your health and be as healthy as possible.
Fox News: Will you be growing one this year?
El Moussa: Unfortunately, I can’t due to my show filming. Although I would love to, I just don’t have that capability. But I will be exercising!
Fox News: How important has it been for you to reach out to fans like that nurse did for you?
El Moussa: You know, it’s very, very important. A lot of people have told me that my story has encouraged them to get checked. Some of them didn’t even know they had cancer. The further along it goes, the worst stage you’re in. So, if I was able to help people catch it in early than that might have saved their lives.
Fox News: Have you stayed in touch with her?
El Moussa: Yeah, we’ve definitely talked in person. We’ve met in person a few times. And every now and then we do check in. I remember when I went through my surgery, I was actually texting her back and forth in my hospital. She’s a very, very special person to me. I’m very lucky.
Fox News: How did she find you?
El Moussa: It wasn’t even social media... She was watching the show in Texas. She emailed my production company. Then they sent me an email. The gist of it was I’m sure if this is a joke or not, but we’re going to send this to you anyway. And it turned out she was right.
Fox News: How has your lifestyle changed since battling cancer?
El Moussa: My exercise before just used to be weight-lifting. I’ve changed my exercise to be more cardio-based, which in result has lowered my heart rate, lowered my blood pressure, and it’s improved my overall health. On top of that, I try to eat very healthy. I take a lot of vitamins and just focus on myself and what’s best for me.
Fox News: How are your children?
El Moussa: They’re doing great! They’re growing so fast. My daughter, she just turned seven. It’s just been amazing to watch how they transform every single day. They say one day you open your eyes and they’re 18. One day I opened my eyes and she’s 7… it’s exciting. I just spend so much time with her. I’m trying to expose her to so many different things, like dirt biking. We go to the lake, we go surfing. We’re just having a blast and I can’t wait to do that with my son.
Fox News: We hear you're working on Season 7 of “Flip or Flop.” What should fans expect?
El Moussa: We’re... probably going to be airing early spring or summer of next year. But you know, we definitely have a good season. We’re doing a lot of different styles of houses. We are going a bit further with design. We’re getting cooler designs. On each property, we’re picking one specific thing that will really stand out. It’s still the same show, but it’s a little more design-based. It’s been a lot of fun filming it.
Fox News: As a public figure, how do you find that balance of keeping your personal life private?
El Moussa: I really don’t get to keep a private life. For me, I’m just a guy who lives a normal life. I go work with my friends; I film my show; I come home; I hang out with my buddies; I go golfing; I go dirt biking, so for me I just live my life.
Fox News: How are you doing these days?
El Moussa: I’m doing great. I lowered my heart rate, I lowered my blood pressure, my cardio is better. Overall, I’m feeling great. It’s the best I’ve ever felt.
Fox News: What’s next for you?
El Moussa: I’m going to continue spreading the word about cancer. People need to get checked. People need to take care of themselves. I’m working on a book. I love public speaking so I’m looking to do more motivational speaking where I can share my story about my health issues, as well as the financial ups and downs I’ve gone through. Hopefully, by sharing my story I will motivate people to change their lives.",0
"The swathes of celebrities who threatened to leave the US if Donald Trump won the Presidency have yet to pack their bags, and most are likely not to. Does that make them liars? Or was it just empty threats designed to make people vote for Hillary (good luck with that).
But perhaps the US might be better off without them. The very principle of Democracy is that people are given a vote which they cast in favor of someone they believe will represent their ideals. If you’re going to leave when you don’t get the result you want, then perhaps you’re not really a good advocate of democracy.
Rosie O’Donnell was one of the celebrities that threatened to leave, and the latest news suggests that she may actually be following through on her promise. We should applaud her commitment to keeping her promise, and encourage others who don’t believe in practicing the democratic process.
True democracy works best when the losers go away and try to either refine their ideas, find a better way to present their ideas, or come up with new ideas that fit their principles. Running distractions, making threats, frustrating the process of government is not the way to win a vote. Be better, and you might just win.

"Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly is flaming mad at how the mainstream media treated the case of the two immigrant teens. One of them is in the U. S. illegally and was accused of raping a Maryland high school student.

“We all know why,” O’Reilly said. “Illegal immigration is a political issue.”
O’ Reilly then warned that “many Americans now have had enough of illegal immigration.” He is right. We the people are tired of these lies from our politicians.
“[There] comes a time when citizens of any country have to demand justice, have to demand protection, demand the law be respected,” O’Reilly said. “We have not, have not, come to that time yet in America.”

"Now is the time of year when we start fantasizing about tropical islands and those fun and flirty drinks that are decorated with umbrellas. It’s the time of year, when just a minute of sun exposure makes you long for those summer days on the water. If you focus deeply enough, you may even be able to hear the waves crashing against the shore or the sound of birds chirping away on a lakeside morning.
Well, if you live in an area of the world that is currently frigid and snowy, then this video may make you a tad envious, however; on the other hand, it will give you something to look forward to in the summer months that are just around the corner.

The silver and white masterpiece is as sleek and sexy as you would expect, based on the name of it. Do you feel the envy growing inside you yet? You just may, when you realize that the boat that is parked in the underneath garage is probably nicer than anything you can afford right now…and we haven’t even gotten to the good part yet.Smooth wooden walls and seductive lighting provide stunning framework and appeal as you pull into the boat’s garage.
Now let’s get to the rest of the flawless design. The top of the yacht is all smooth surfaces with a staircase that leads up to a cushioned lounge area, complete with an array of scattered pillows for the ultimate passenger comfort. And let’s face it…a yacht wouldn’t be complete without a built in rooftop hot tub, in the event that you don’t find yourself naturally relaxing just by stepping on board.
On one of the lower levels, there are several tables and couches, where diners can get cozy, along with several bars that all appear to be filled with fresh bottles of champagne. Because, why wouldn’t you be celebrating every second of the day if you owned this baby, right?
This isn’t your average dinghy and you never have to worry about not looking and feeling your best on board, as there is a modern shower and bath enclosed in crystal clear glass.
For those special occasions, there is a long dining room table for several guests to make toasts and enjoy a five course meal.
One of the other many rooms, contains a white baby grand piano surrounded by distressed coffee tables and couches adding to that oceanside appeal. All rooms are decorated to perfection, with dark wood, sleek white furniture and splashes of lime green to brighten up all the nooks and crannies. And you never have to worry about being deprived of an oceanfront view, as each bedroom contains sliding glass doors that overlook the water, framed by curtains in the event that you want more privacy.

Rep. Trey Gowdy from South Carolina went on Fox News’ Tucker Carlson Tonight and then discussed on Tuesday the person that leaked the details of national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn. He said that he, in essence, broke the law.
“That’s the felonious dissemination of classified material,” Gowdy told host Tucker Carlson. “[House intelligence committee] Chairman [Devin] Nunes’ point is, I want to know whether or not other people have been unmasked, even though you don’t know about it publicly yet.”
Rep. Nunes is being told by both Democrats and Republicans that he needs to recuse himself of ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign. This week Nunes showed that he met with a source near the White House to review documents that will blow the case wide open.
“I think they’re both of national interest,” Gowdy told Carlson. “One happens to be a felony, so I was a little surprised and a little disappointed that [Comey] can’t at least tell us, ‘We are investigating the felonious dissemination of classified material.’”
“So, if there were an evidentiary basis for that, it’s pretty easy to lay that out,” he said. “There’s a paper trail.”

The link has since been restored and is now visible on the groups page, but a spokesperson for Unicorn Riot believes the livestream was censored.
The crude oil pipeline is the subject of protest, in part, because environmentalists and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe claim its construction is destroying sacred sites and natural resources or risks damaging them.
In an emailed statement to RT, a member of the Unicorn Riot said, “our collective members immediately noticed that the full Livestream event URL (https://livestream.com/unicornriot/events/6340986) was being blocked from Facebook.”
“Posts and comments with the URL both immediately triggered popup security alerts,” the team member continued. “We tried putting the same URL through Bitly shortening and that official Unicorn Riot page post was deleted by Facebook within a few minutes. Finally we went with sharing our ‘Live Channel’ URL on our own website which had the embed included on it.”
The statement went on to clarify that “the ‘Facebook Debugger’ warned that our live video URL violated ‘community standards.’”
In its response, Facebook offered little more than words to make up for blocking the news content.
“The link was removed in error and restored as soon as we were able to investigate. Our team processes millions of reports each week, and we sometimes get things wrong. We’re very sorry about this mistake,” a Facebook spokesperson toldMotherboard.
Blaming “both Facebook and law enforcement” for blocking their media distribution, the collective member vowed, “we will not let them stop our mission to amplify the voices of people who might otherwise go unheard, and broadcast the stories that might otherwise go untold.”
“Also, as one member of the collective, I should point out it is obviously concerning when a large media conglomerate blocks URLs to competing video platforms,” the Unicorn Riot member concluded.",1
"Ankara’s office has reportedly emailed a number of Turkish organizations in the European country, urging their employees to warn the consulate of any “insulting” messages received via personal online accounts.
Turkey’s Consulate General to Rotterdam asks Turks in Netherlands to be informer about people who insult Erdogan! pic.twitter.com/JwfDSdVget
According to the letter shared on Twitter, it said:
“To whom it may concern,
If you or the employees working in your NGO or their relatives or the people around you received messages from people who are insulting our president, the Turkish nation or Turkey in general in to your mailboxes or social media accounts, we would kindly ask you to send the names and the quotes that they put to the mail address of our Rotterdam Consulate General.“
The campaign is “aimed against everything that’s being shared on Twitter, Facebook and even in private emails,” Dutch freelance journalist and author Frederike Geerdink told RT, adding that Ankara’s move has “immediately caused big discussion in Holland.“
“Politicians in Holland worry, they say this is what in Holland is called ‘the long arm of Ankara,’ meaning that the government in Ankara tries to get a grip on their diaspora communities” in various European countries, including Germany, Britain, Belgium, and now in the Netherlands, Geerdink said.
“They try to influence how Dutch Turks behave,” she added, saying that the European officials “will talk with the Consulate about this and express their worries.” There will be a debate on the matter in the parliament as well, the journalist told RT.
On Wednesday, the Dutch government announced its plans to scrap legislation which makes insulting a friendly head of state a criminal offense, Dutch News reported.
Following the Consulate’s call, Ankara’s consul should be called to The Hague to explain it, the Dutch news source reported, citing an MP from the country’s right-wing VNL party. “Turkey needs to be reminded of the right to freedom of speech,” Joram van Klaveren was quoted as saying.
There has been no official comment from the Turkish Consulate. When it was approached by Dutch journalists asking as of what the information the officials were aiming to receive would be used for, “the Consulate played it down saying there is not much to worry about, [as they] only want to make an inventory of what is being said in Holland,” Geerdink told RT.
While the state of freedom of speech and expression in Turkey has been questioned by a number of international organizations and governments in recent months, Ankara also aims to control of what’s being said about its president in other countries. Recently, Turkey reportedly tried to pressurize Germany into removing a satirical clip aired by a German broadcaster criticizing President Erdogan. In a separate episode, the Turkish leader has submitted a personal complaint against another German comedian for libel.",1

"5 myths and truths about kids' Internet safety
The concern: I can't keep up with all of the media my kid is into, so I don't know what games and apps to keep my eye on.
The facts:
According to the New England Journal of Public Policy, contact with online predators happens mostly in chat rooms, on social media, or in the chat feature of a multiplayer game (Roblox, Minecraft, Clash of Clans, World of Warcraft, and so on).
Most games meant for kids -- like Roblox and Animal Jam -- have built-in features and settings that are designed to prevent inappropriate comments and chat. Though they're often imperfect, they do help.
Games that aren't designed only for kids have fewer controls, settings, and safeguards.
Any app or online space that allows contact with strangers without moderation or age verification can allow contact between kids and adult strangers.
Teens sometimes visit adult sites, chat rooms, and dating apps out of curiosity about sex and romance.
What parents should know about videochat, live-streaming apps
The strategy: First, stay on top of what your kid is doing online by asking them which apps, games, and other tech they use. If they're on social media, friend or follow them. Set rules about times and places for device use -- for example, banning phones and tablets from bedrooms. Find out how they chat -- is it through an app or through their phone's SMS texting? (If they're using an app, it won't be easy for you to see it, so ask to do occasional spot checks.) Make rules around who they can chat with -- for instance, only people they know in real life. If your kid's a gamer, use these questions to probe deeper: Do you like multiplayer games -- and why? Do you chat with others while you're gaming? What's been your experience so far? What would you do if someone you didn't know contacted you? Help them set privacy settings to limit the contacts in their games.
The concern: I don't even understand how this works -- does an adult pose as a kid, then ask to meet?
The facts:
Only 5 percent of online predators pretend they're kids. Most reveal that they're older -- which is especially appealing to 12-to-15-year-olds who are most often targeted.
Some predators initiate sexual talk or request pictures immediately and back off if refused. They're in it for an immediate result.
In contrast, some predators engage in ""bunny hunting,"" which is the process of picking a potential victim for ""grooming"": They'll look at social media posts and public chats to learn about the kid first.
Once they've selected someone, they may begin the grooming phase, which often involves friending the target's contacts, engaging in increasingly personal conversations to build trust, taking the conversation to other platforms (like instant messaging), requesting pictures, and finally requesting offline contact.
Sometimes if a kid shares one compromising picture, a predator will engage in ""sextortion,"" which involves demanding more pictures or contact under threat of exposure or harm.
Here's how to tackle cyberbullying
The strategy: We often tell kids not to talk to strangers or share personal information, but a kid's online relationships can feel just as real as their offline ones. So before they start chatting with anyone online, kids need to know some basic digital citizenship and online privacy information. For instance, kids should never share a phone number, address, or even last name with someone they've never met. Also, sharing sexy pictures or being overtly sexual online leaves an unwanted legacy, with or without creepy adults, so we need to teach kids about being mindful about their digital footprint. Plus, having nude pictures of a minor -- even if you are a minor -- is against the law and teens can get into legal trouble as a result. Finally, it's important to teach kids that if someone is asking a kid for sexy pictures or chat, that person is not a friend, no matter how cool or understanding they seem.
Apps to help keep track of what your kids are doing online
The concern: How would I even know if this is happening to my kid if they don't come out and tell me?
The facts:
Predators target kids who post revealing pictures, divulge past sexual abuse, and/or engage in sexual talk online.
There's some conflicting research about what ages are most at-risk, but 12 to 15 seems to be prime time, and girls are more frequent victims.
Teen boys who are questioning their sexuality are the second-most targeted group because they often feel talking about it online is safer than sharing in real life.
Sometimes, teens egg each other on to pursue contact with strangers online, and it can feel like a game.
Teens want to feel special, validated, attractive, and understood at a time when they're separating from their parents, so an older ""friend"" who's very interested in them can feel exciting and special.
Most often, teens engage in relationships with predators willingly, though they often keep them secret.
If your kid withdraws and becomes secretive around a device (hiding the screen, clicking from a window suddenly), it could be an indicator.
Phone calls and gifts from unknown people are possible signs.
Porn on the device your kid uses might be a sign.
Brutally Honest: Is it OK to spy on your kids?
The strategy: The tricky part is that most tweens and teens withdraw and are sometimes secretive; it's part of their development. If, however, you notice these in the extreme, that's a concern -- no matter the reason. Spot checks on the devices your kid uses to monitor for sexy posts and pictures and knowing some lingo can help, but open communication -- without accusation or overreaction -- is usually the most effective.
7 reasons parents should care about kids and online privacy
The concern: This already happened to my kid, and I don't know what to do next.
The facts:
Your kid told you.
You saw something on his or her phone or social media.
Join the conversation
See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.
The strategy: First, don't panic. Instead, gather evidence: Take screenshots, save communications, and so on. Talk with your kid about the details without making them feel like it's their fault or that they're in trouble. Then report it to the platform or service your kid is using, block the person, and find the reporting features on other apps and games your kid uses together. Finally, contact the police. Even though it may seem like a one-time thing, that it's over, or you don't want to make it a big deal, it's best to let the authorities know in case the person is a known offender and to prevent them from doing it to other kids.",0
"A mobile game developer in Toronto, Ontario, is seeing a wave of backlash after announcing a new app called “Dirty Chinese Restaurant.”
The game, developed by a company called Big-O-Tree Games, tasks players with assuming the role of Wong Fu, a restaurateur who inherited the titular “dirty” establishment from his brother. The objective is to turn the restaurant into a thriving establishment, but players are allowed to run the business as ""honest or dishonest"" as they desire, and they have the option of killing stray dogs and cats to serve to customers, or running the kitchen like a “sweatshop,” reports the International Business Times.
BAR OWNER ACCUSED OF RACISM AFTER USING LYNCH, KAEPERNICK JERSEYS AS DOORMATS
A preview of the game also shows Wong Fu digging through trash cans for provisions, as well as an Immigration Officer deporting one of his employees.
New York Representative Grace Meng (D) has since come out against the game, and urged Google, Apple and Android to refrain from offering it on their platforms.
“This game uses every negative and demeaning stereotype that I have ever come across as a Chinese American,” wrote Meng in a Facebook post. “From the names used for the characters of the game, to the types of food they cook, to the disturbing depiction of their faces, this game epitomizes racism against Asian Americans.”
SMOOTHIE CUSTOMER DEMANDS ANSWERS AFTER BEING CALLED 'BLACK CHICK' ON RECEIPT
A number of Canadian politicians — both liberal and conservative — have also denounced the game, including Markham, Ontario mayor Frack Scarpitti; Kathleen Wynne, who serves as the Premier of Ontario; and Canadian Parliament member Bob Saroya, who called the game ""disgusting.""
China’s Global Times added that citizens of both China and North America are upset about the game, with one telling the China Press that “putting out such a racist game is ridiculous.”
According to Big-O-Tree’s website, however, this kind of controversy may be exactly what they intended. The landing page for Big-O-Tree Games currently features a message reading “being politically correct is so … boring,” and the company also writes that it aims to make “offbeat games we know you want to play, but you didn’t think anyone had the cojones to make!”
In a subsequent statement posted to their website and shared with Fox News, Big-O-Tree games addressed the backlash directly, writing that they “Dirty Chinese Restaurant” is meant to be “mainly satire.”
“It has come to our attention that our small, independent game, ‘Dirty Chinese Restaurant,’ has upset some people due to its content,” the statement reads. “Our game is mainly satire and comedy influenced by the classic politically incorrect shows we grew up watching, such as: ‘South Park,’ ‘All in the Family,’ ‘Sanford & Son,’ ‘Family Guy,’ ‘Simpsons,’ and ‘Chappelle’s Show.’ We also listen to Jay-Z. Our game in no way is meant to be an accurate representation of Chinese culture.”

"No matter what you turn, it seems the world is burning and chaos reigns supreme. War, threats of war, racism, violence, hatred, and division populate the news cycle and leave us few options but to hang our heads in hopelessness, despair, and increasingly, rage.
While there certainly are countless reasons to be concerned about humanity’s trajectory, however, positive thingsarehappening, and it’s important to be aware of them to keep things in perspective — and to keep your sanity. Here are some recent and long-term developments to remind you there is still hope for the human race.
Let’s start with some antidotes to the most depressing news of the past week:
Last week, many Americans worried nuclear war was upon us after Donald Trump and North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un exchanged violent threats. Media reports that North Korea possesses dangerous weapons capable of reaching the U. S. persist, but other reports have suggested the threat is not what the hype has led us to believe.
For one, many South Koreans havedeclinedto fall victim to the hysteria and continue to live their lives. Various military-oriented news outlets have alsoreportedthat American troops and defense institutions are not moving forward with war operations. South Korea’s presidentsaidthis week that there will be no war.
Further, respected MIT professor Theodore Postol, along with two other atomic experts, published anarticlelate last weekindicatingthey believe fears of North Korea’s nuclear capabilities have been exaggerated by the North Korean government, adding that the West’s fearful reaction is exactly the intention the regime hoped to incite.
After a week of chaos regarding North Korea, the U. S. news cycle upped the ante with the disturbing protests and subsequent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday. Some protesters waved Nazi flags and dressed in KKK regalia, chanting “White lives matter” and “Jews will not replace us.” Some counter-protesters showed up ready to fight and waving communist flags. Ultimately, a car driven by a white supremacist smashed into counter-protesters,killing three individualsand injuring many more. While the event certainly displayed the deep divisions currently plaguing American society, they also served to highlight fringe elements. In reality, most Americans arenot Nazis or communistsand completely reject the behavior on display this weekend, even if they succumb to more mainstream partisan divides.
Further, the market has responded to the displays of hatred in a variety of ways. Nazis are beingoutedon social media, and the white supremacist website, Daily Stormer, has beenshut downnot only by their GoDaddy server but also Google, which cited violations of their terms of service. Discord, a chat service for gamers, alsoterminatedthe accounts of white supremacists. Intolerance for intolerance is everywhere.
Further, it’s worth noting that at this point in time, the Nazi presence in the United States is not as strong — or accepted — as it was in the 1930s. At that time, American Nazishelda massive event at Madison Square Garden andbuilt a bunkerin preparation for after Hitler conquered the world and the United States collapsed.
But focusing solely on these two events, even if the goal is to demonstrate that they haven’t wholly doomed human progress, fails to do justice to the wide variety of other positive developments taking place.
For one, Bitcoin has continued torisein value, bolstering opposition to the current central banking fiat currency monopoly. It surpassed $4,000 late last week and continues to grow. The FDA, which last year recommended that the DEA keep cannabis a Schedule I drug, is nowtaking public commentson the potential benefits of cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive ingredient cannabinoid showing increasing promise for use as medicine.
They are expected to present these comments, which may also focus on a variety of other drugs, to the World Health Organization (this is far from an indicator they will legalize it, but it’s undeniably a trend in the right direction). A recentsurveyof beekeepers recently found that the bee population is starting to rebound after years of decline.
Musician Bruno Mars hasdonateda million dollars to combat Flint’s ongoing water crisis, Chance the Rapper justgave30,000 backpacks to school children in Chicago, and a new organization in San Diego, called Eat San Diego,launchedan effort this year to plant free food gardens around the city.
Long-term developments are also helping humanity, from apps tomake it easierto feed the homeless totiny homesand3-D printed houses, which can be used to help give them shelter. Emerging 3-D printed meatmay eventuallyreduce dependence on factory farming, and consumers are increasinglydemandingcleaner food options.
Despite President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, Morgan Stanley recentlyreleasedan analysis contending that the U. S. will meet climate goals, anyway. Alternative forms of energy arebecomingmoreaffordabledespite the fargreater subsidiesthe fossil fuel industry still receives. The rise in cannabis use isunderminingthe pharmaceutical monopoly, alcohol industry, and police and prison guard unions.
Despite its shortcomings, the independent media is thriving and challenging official narratives, and corporate news sources are increasinglyexposedfor their biases and political loyalties.
People are ever moreinterestedin expanding their own consciousness, and some are starting young — in Baltimore, for example, the Holistic Life Foundationteachesstudents the power of meditation and yoga whileencouragingthem to take part in their communities, maintaining gardens and cleaning up trash.
Though it’s easy to get caught up in the media’s constant barrage of negative news, it helps to remember that that’s what sells — that fear and outrage get more ratings than community and progress. “If it bleeds, it leads,”goesthe long-standing newsroom trope.
While we may be a long way off from world peace, saving the planet, and ending the corporate-authoritarian state, progress is all around, and in times like these, it is vital to pay attention to it.

The “Anti” in our name does not mean we are against the media, we are simply against the current mainstream paradigm. The current media, influenced by the industrial complex, is a top-down authoritarian system of distribution—the opposite of what Anti-Media aims to be. At Anti-Media, we want to offer a new paradigm—a bottom-up approach for real and diverse reporting. We seek to establish a space where the people are the journalists and a venue where independent journalism moves forward on a larger and more truthful scale.

"The Liberals target anyone for sexual impropriety when they disagree with their fake news practices. They are doing their best to slowly knock down any conservative on Fox News along with the current owners of FOX NEWS.
After Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly, Bill Shine and Charles Payne, Fox News’ host of news show “The Specialists” Eric Bolling is yet another one from Fox News Network who is accused of sexual impropriety. According to the Huffington Post, Bolling sent pictures of male genitalia to at least three female colleagues. The website cited 14 unnamed sources in its report, including the women who allegedly received the lewd text messages. The strange thing is that Bolling sent the unsolicited graphic messages several years ago. However, all three women, whose identities were not revealed, say they recognized his number from previous interactions.
On Friday evening Bolling’s attorney, Michael J. Bowe said: “The story is based on anonymous sources and not true. No such unsolicited communications occurred. Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made.”
Fox News said it plans to investigate these claims. We were just informed of this late Friday afternoon via a Huff Post inquiry and plan to investigate the matter.”
A former commodities trader and CNBC anchor, Bolling has worked at Fox News and Fox Business since 2007. He currently serves as host of news show “The Specialists” on Fox News. Bolling’s contract with Fox News was renewed in June.
But still, if this thing happened years ago, I wonder what took these woman so long to come forward. You don’t get to wait years then claim you’re offended. Should have spoken up when and if it occurred. Some of this is not believable.
It now looks to me that another Trump supporter is being assaulted by the progressive media. Can’t they think up any other accusations? This is getting old and we all recognize it for what it is.

"When customers across the country flood into Walmart stores on a daily basis, they feel as though they are supporting an all-American business. The nation’s largest retailer has profited in the billions from this belief. However, the retailer just royally enraged the wrong part of theircustomer base with a sign that popped up inside that’s cause for a boycott.
Among the store filled with everything people need for a cheap price, was a little white sign with black writing that appeared near the entrance. It was to alert incoming shoppers hopeful of taking advantage of some of the other services offered in the store, that they are going to need to make other arrangements — that is unless you’re Muslim.
After eight years of political correctness and excuses for the so-called “religion of peace,” it’s become the only religion in the country that’s given precedence over all others when followers pitch a fit. Walmart is now added to the list of safe spaces for Muslims after what one employee took upon themselves to make a statement on behalf of a Muslim woman in the store.
Like Minnesota, Michigan has become another Muslim “Mecca” of the United States where towns like Dearborn are completely overrun by Islam and operate under their own rules. This mentality has seeped out of one city and into others as was just seenin Taylor, Michigan.
If men in Taylor were hoping to get a quick and inexpensive haircut at the Taylor Walmart on this day, they got some bad news on arrival. One Muslim woman put everyone in the store out, by taking over the entire SmartStyle salon that afternoon with what she feels was her religious right.
Although management of the Walmart in Taylor did the right thing by firing the employee who posted the sign without permission, some feel it was more reactionary than proactive.
As the demand for acceptance of Muslim culture spreads, we are seeing more and more instances of people creating situations that should never be acceptable. A Taylor, Michigan hair salon employee did exactly that. In order to let a Muslim woman feel “comfortable” while getting her hair done, the employee put up a sign saying “no men please.”
The incident happened at a SmartStyle Family Hair Salon inside a Wal-Mart. The employee, who has not been identified, was fired after the picture of the sign went viral. Naturally, management claims the employee did not have permission to post the sign and that she was scheduled to leave the job before the whole thing took place.
The sign was posted on July 10 but the management claims they did not know about it until 15 days later when the photos were posted online. Store manager Erika Van Etten says the anonymous man called, claimed the sign was posted that day and gave a false name and phone number.
While it should seem obvious that a store employee is not allowed to dictate their own rules for any reason without permission, this SmartStyle salon worker learned the hard way.
Immediately catering to Islam at the cost of turning away countless customers, this employee decided to isolate an entire section of society so one person could get their hair cut.
The fact that this was solely based on the customer’s religious beliefs should be reason for the ACLU to get involved, but it’s the only religion they seem to protect, so it’s silent on that front. However, had this employee done the right thing and denied this unreasonable request, we would have all heard from CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) about it by now.
“We are not allowed to close the salon under any circumstances for anyone. If someone has a head scarf we are to let them know that we cannot close the salon and if a man comes in we cannot stop them,” the store manager said, according to the News-Herald.
“I was not here for this incident and this was the result of a former employee taking it upon herself to do her own thing,Van Etten explained. “I reiterate that this is a former employee that has been taken care of. As far as what happened. I apologize for anyone who gotoffended by this sign however again I was not here for the incident.”
The corporate office chimed in with their own politically correct statement:
“SmartStyle welcomes all guests, and we apologize to anyone who was offended by the piece of paper taped to the salon window,” they said. “The message was inappropriate and it does not reflect our standards or beliefs; our goal is to offer a quality experience to all guests. Again, our apologies to anyone who was offended.”
It’s only a matter of time before liberals start losing their minds that the woman who put up the sign was “discriminated” against and shouldn’t have lost her job. Regardless if the now former employee had planned to quit or not, she broke the rules of the store with the sign and that of the country by catering to one religion over all others while also isolating an entire gender. If it wasn’t for the benefit of Muslims, this is what the left would be irate about.",1

For most Republicans, what matters most about Donald Trump is that he's demonstrated resolve against the enemy—not the Islamic State or the Taliban, but the media.
The media has become for the right what the Soviet Union was during the Cold War—a common, unifying adversary of overwhelming importance. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, religious conservatives and libertarians could agree that, whatever their other differences, godless communism had to be resisted. This commitment was the glue of the GOP coalition, and the basic price of admission to conservatism.
Now, a policy of containment, preferably rollback, of the mainstream media occupies that central role. Trump may not know how to get anything done, may not have a well-developed philosophy, may not be delivering on his agenda, may not be an admirable person, but he's a righteous, unyielding warrior against the media. And this is the one non-negotiable. To put it in terms of the famous Isaiah Berlin essay, the fox knows many things; the hedgehog knows one thing — CNN sucks.
The right’s hostility toward the media is long-standing. It has always represented the liberal establishment and the coastal elite and, therefore, an obstacle to be diminished and worked around. In fact, over the past 50 years, no one has improved on what Spiro Agnew said in a famous speech in Des Moines, Iowa, in November 1969, or even really said anything new.
The media is biased. Agnew complained that on TV after President Richard Nixon gave a speech on Vietnam, “his words and policies were subjected to instant analysis and querulous criticism.”
The media is too powerful. Agnew rued how “a raised eyebrow, an inflection of the voice, a caustic remark dropped in the middle of a broadcast can raise doubts in a million minds about the veracity of a public official or the wisdom of a government policy.”
The media is in a bubble. “To a man, these commentators and producers live and work in the geographical and intellectual confines of Washington, D. C., or New York City” and “talk constantly to one another.”
The media is due for a fall. It’s time to question why such power is “in the hands of a small and unelected elite.”
Anti-media politics isn't hard to pull off. Even the courtly George H.W. Bush got it right in a contentious exchange with Dan Rather during the 1988 campaign. According to the New York Times, the offices of CBS and the Bush campaign were swamped afterward with calls “overwhelmingly supportive of the vice president and negative toward CBS.”
More recently, Newt Gingrich demonstrated the transformative potential of theatrical attacks on the moderators in his show-stopping performances in two debates before the South Carolina primary in 2012. He wouldn't have won the state without them.
Trump’s insight was basically, “What if every day were like that?” After witnessing the fate of two candidates who got savage coverage in the general election, despite being a media darling in the case of John McCain and being an earnest, well-meaning man in the case of Mitt Romney, Republican voters were ready for harsher stuff. The famous George H.W. Bush bumper sticker from 1992 was, ""Annoy the Media: Re-elect Bush."" In 2016, it became in effect, “Drive the Media Out of Its Ever-Loving Minds: Vote Trump: Elect Trump.”
Trump had long had his own problems with the media, not that it was too liberal, but that it wasn't nearly favorable enough to Donald Trump. With his talents as a showman, his knack for branding (“fake news”), his taste for combat, his instinct for what energizes an audience, and his high tolerance for controversy, he was ideally suited to transfer his long-developed personal sensitivity to slights from reporters to the ideological realm of Republican presidential politics. Almost as much as anything else, he rode his mutual enmity with the media to the White House.
It remains a lifeline. Most commentators saw Trump angrily saying indefensible things about Charlottesville at the news conference last week; most Republicans saw him gamely standing his ground in front of a group of braying reporters. At his rally in Phoenix, Trump upped the rhetorical ante against the media and used its lack of credibility to try to undermine the critique of his Charlottesville remarks.
He’s pushing against an open door with his audience because the media is, indeed, worse than ever before. As the media environment has fractured, organizations feel less obligation to try to cultivate a broader audience. And as politics becomes more culturally charged, the divide between the heartland and the coasts where the media lives and works becomes even more stark and important. Then, there's the reaction to Trump himself. Since he is genuinely outrageous, especially to coastal sensibilities, the media feels justified in its unremittingly harsh coverage, perhaps even believing that if it is breathlessly hysterical enough, it can drive him from office.
Some in the media are happy to play along with the role Trump allots them, as long as it serves the twin goals of self-referentiality and ratings. CNN at times appears to be a network devoted to covering things that the president says about the network. Prior to Trump’s rally in Phoenix, CNN relentlessly promoted the event. Then it took the whole thing, and devoted the rest of the night to blow-out coverage of commentators pronouncing themselves outraged and dismayed. At the end of the day, what had really happened? Nothing much, but at least something entertaining had filled the air.
Trump might well have been hate-watching much of it, pleased somewhere beneath his anger and disgust that he had, once again, proved to have the right enemy.

"Science magazine has unveiled its 2015 ""Breakthrough of the Year"" and the winner is a gene-editing technology that experts say will change life as we know it -- potentially revolutionizing medicine, basic science, and agriculture.
The gene-editing tool called CRISPR -- derived from a bacterial protein -- lets scientists cut and paste specific portions of DNA, offering a path to new treatments or cures for genetic diseases.
Science managing news editor John Travis said while the technique was first developed in 2012, CRISPR came into its own this year and has begun to transform science and spark public debate, making it the most outstanding scientific development of 2015.
It's an ""unprecedented selection,"" Travis told CBS News. CRISPR has appeared twice before as a Science ""Breakthrough"" runner-up. It's the only runner-up to later be elevated to ""Breakthrough of the Year"" status.
CRISPR nudged out this year's Pluto space mission for the top vote, Travis said. In July, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft sent back images of ice mountains, nitrogen glaciers, and an array of tumbling moons.
The selection process is a careful one, Travis said. ""Throughout the year, we try to keep track of major developments and then after Labor Day, we collect a short list of 40  to 45 possibilities and begin a winnowing process,"" he said.
Discussion and debate ensues until the top ten choices are made.
""As the year went on, CRISPR had done so many new things that were profoundly affecting how science is conducted and profoundly affecting how society is going to have to have to deal with CRISPR that in the end we felt we couldn't deny its elevation to the top choice,"" said Travis.
He said this year was special for CRISPR for a number of reasons. In the December 17 issue of Science, Travis highlights two stand-out examples: the creation of a long-sought ""gene drive"" that could eliminate pests or the diseases they carry, and the first intentional gene editing of DNA in human embryos, controversial work by Chinese researchers who used nonviable embryos from a fertility clinic.
The embryo work spurred a gene editing summit, convening top experts from around the world in Washington, DC, in early December.
""The summit confronted a fraught -- and newly plausible -- prospect: altering human sperm, eggs, or early embryos to correct disease genes or offer 'enhancements,'"" Travis wrote in his article.
This year, researchers were also able to conduct a CRISPR-driven deletion of 62 copies of a retrovirus' DNA in the pig genome, which could have major implications for humans who need organs, Travis said. The Science paper was published in early November by Harvard researchers.
CRISPR's ability to deliver a gene to precisely the right location, compared to the techniques that came before it, and its affordability and relative ease of use in the lab, make it a desirable tool, scientists at the summit said earlier this month.
""It's only slightly hyperbolic to say that if scientists can dream of a genetic manipulation, CRISPR can now make it happen,"" Travis said.
""We -- the world, science, patients and our descendants -- need gene editing to be pursued and if possible, to be made safe enough to be used in humans,"" said John Harris, professor of bioethics and director of the Institute for Science, Ethics and Innovation in the School of Law at the University of Manchester. Harris spoke at the gene editing summit earlier this month.
In an accompanying editorial in Science, Marcia McNutt, editor-in-chief of the Science family of journals, said, ""In two years' time CRISPR will have brought to many diverse fields in biology the enduring level of excitement and optimism that immunotherapy has brought to cancer patients.""
CRISPR research has already begun in somatic (non-reproductive) cells. ""The earliest ones are going to be somatic interventions with various kinds of blood stem cells,"" Pilar Ossorio, professor of law and bioethics at the Morgridge Institute for Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told CBS News at the gene editing summit in Washington, DC.
""For instance, if you wanted to try and increase somebody's pancreatic islet cells' production of insulin, you might want that gene editing, or 'gene therapy,' to go right to the pancreatic islet cells,"" Ossorio said. Theoretically, the therapy could help people with certain types of diabetes whose pancreas cells don't make enough insulin.
""You'll see a bevy of CRISPR uses in editing the DNA of cells that have been taken outside of the body and then returned to a person,"" said Travis.
And CRISPR will be used in agriculture as well, he predicts. ""The ease with which we can manipulate plant DNA with it -- we are going to see a lot more genetically modified plants and there's going to be controversy about how to handle them in the regulatory sense.""
Science readers had the chance to weigh in and vote in a separate people's choice ""Breakthrough"" poll, and Pluto won its moment in the sun, taking first place with 35 percent of the popular vote. CRISPR came in second with 20 percent of the public's vote.",0
"On the heels of major shakeups at the Fox News Network, an alternative conservative network is being actively discussed amongst conservative fat cats.
A well-placed source close to the proposal tells Mediaite that serious discussions are underway to create an alternative conservative cable network on the belief that the Fox News Network is moving too far to the left. The source, who is engaged in the talks, says a meeting is planned for today with two prominent high-powered television executives, some underperforming conservative networks and people who have an interest and the ability to fund a new network.
The potential aim? Putting “the old band” back together. There are certainly plenty of (out-of-work?) conservative powerhouses to pick from that could star on a new network, and perhaps even some executives from within Fox News who might be lured by the new opportunity. Could the new channel include stars like the ousted Bill O’Reilly, who didn’t waste much time hitting the podcast waves after he was fired amid a sexual harassment scandal? Could Tomi Lahren, the conservative mega star, who was recently sidelined at The Blaze also take on a prominent role? The exact “who” won’t be clear until the deal is more defined but the source says the pitch is that the network could immediately reach at least 85 million homes.
This news comes on the heels of a long profile in last weekend’s New York Times which paints a picture of a changing Fox News Network with Murdoch’s sons, James and Lachlan, CEO and co-chairman of parent company 21st Century Fox, at the helm. The piece struck fear into the minds of some Fox News’ hardcore conservatives with talk of the sons wanting to rid the company “of the old-guard culture on which their father built his empire” and bringing “a warmer and fuzzier workplace” that would move away from an “anti-politically correct environment.”
On Thursday, New York Magazine‘s Gabe Sherman, a constant thorn in the side of Fox News, reported that “sweeping management changes” may be coming to the network as well. Sherman’s report cited three anonymous sources that contend that the network’s co-President Bill Shine recently asked the Murdoch sons to release a statement in support of him amid the roiling lawsuits and scandals. Both Fox News and 21 Century Fox have vigorously denied that Shine made such a request but the report by Sherman prompted a rather mysterious tweet about the “total end of the FNC as we know it” by the network’s biggest remaining star, Sean Hannity:
Gbe i pray this is NOT true because if it is, that's the total end of the FNC as we know it. Done. Best Sean https://t.co/W3BJ2wjzRD
— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 27, 2017
“I just don’t see Fox News and Sean having a long relationship. If Sean becomes available, you have 100 percent turnover in primetime and a huge opportunity,” a television executive, who didn’t want to be identified, but is involved in some of the talks, told Mediaite.
“I’m working on it (the new conservative channel) hot and heavy,” the source said. “It’s live, it’s real.” The new channel could come to fruition within the next 10 to 12 months, the executive said.
It is no surprise that a savvy investor would see the turmoil within Fox News as a major opportunity. As The Times piece noted, analysts estimate that Fox News produced 25 percent of 21st Century Fox’s operating income last year or a whopping $6.6 billion. Conservative news remains a cash cow for investors, but the media landscape is quickly changing with younger viewers “cutting the cord” and turning to alternative over-the-top live streaming platforms like Hulu, Amazon, Roku and YouTube TV. Could a conservative alternative channel with some big names have an edge on the 20-year-old conservative network? Stay tuned. Our source is convinced it can happen.
Update 12:58 p.m: This article has been updated with a quote from a television executive who is involved in the talks.

Russia Goes Ballistic After US Provides 14 Web Pages As Their Evidence To Bomb Syria
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
An absolutely astonishing Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that both President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov were angered beyond belief after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson turned over to Russia the United States evidence that Syria had used chemical weapons against their citizens that consisted of 14 printed web pages and 3 videos (marked Top Secret)all of which were created by a not Top Secret social media website called the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR)that is a one man operation based in the United Kingdom, and though relied on exclusively by Western mainstream propaganda media sources, has always refused to share its sources, raw data or methodology with anyone.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, at the same time Secretary Tillerson gave this evidence to Minister Lavrov yesterday, the White House then released a document accusing Moscow of disseminating conflicting accounts in order to create confusion and sow doubt within the international communitybut that the Security Council denies by pointing out that all President Putin had done was call for an international investigation of this incident as there were more than one possible reason for its occurringwith the least likely of them being that the Syrian government was responsible.
Not just President Putin has expressed extreme skepticism over the Trump regimes evidence either, this report continues, as after an unnamed US official secretly briefed the media yesterday, he was left shaken when journalists noted the many lies he was tellingmost particularly his failing to provide any logical reason as to why Syria would even do such a thing.
Want to know the truth?  Click HERE.
Joining these now confused Western journalists failing to understand what exactly happened, this report notes, are numerous American and European experts who previously had warned that the 2003 US invasion of Iraq was all based on lies, and who are all now exposing this false flag event tooincluding Hans Blix, the former head of the UN Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission, who said merely pictures of victims that were held up, that the whole world can see with horror, such pictures are not necessarily evidence of who did it and two dozen senior US intelligence and military officers who yesterday wrote:
Our U.S. Army contacts in the area have told us this is not what happened. There was no Syrian chemical weapons attack. Instead, a Syrian aircraft bombed an al-Qaeda-in-Syria ammunition depot that turned out to be full of noxious chemicals and a strong wind blew the chemical-laden cloud over a nearby village where many consequently died.
Likewise joining President Putins assertion that the Trump regimes attack on Syria was a violation of international law, this report says, is Stefan Talmon of Oxford University (one of the Wests own top international law experts) who in an interview about the Trump regimes unprovoked attack stated: An airstrike, like any other attack on a state, requires a mandate from the UN Security Council. According to the UN Charter, all five great international powers, must, as permanent members, approve of a military attack. Or in exceptional cases - if there is no UN mandate - a case must be made for self-defense.
With President Putin further slamming NATOs support for the Trump regimes blatant violation of international law in bombing Syria saying they are all nodding like bobbleheads, this report continues, he again urged the international community to check information about this chemical attack thoroughly, stressed that the Kremlin is curious what ephemeral intelligence sources the US has, and called the American demand for Russia to abandon Syrian leader Assad absurd.
Like what is now occurring in the Kremlin with it being attacked by the Trump regime for simply asking it to provide real evidence, this report says, so too in America are that nations citizens being attacked for wanting to know the truthand that the hugely popular Fox News host Tucker Carlson noted the other day on his programme by stating that news coverage has never been faker after the Obama-Clinton-Trump supporting communistic media began calling anyone not supporting this illegal war action white supremacist racists.
By Russia choosing to use the same criteria used by the Trump regime in bombing Syria, this report concludes, the Security Council has unanimously agreed that Federation military forces are now able to start bombing, if not outright invading, the Nordic nation of Sweden as numerous social media web pages and videos are now showing that country is so under siege by Islamic terrorists that its women and young children can no longer walk its streets due to fears of being gang raped, its postal service has had to suspend service to Muslim neighborhoods for our staffs safety, and one of its major newspapers, Aftonbladet, is calling for the total banning of all cars so they cant be used in terror attacksbut that once Russian military forces begin to act, like the US in Syria, the whole Western world will then be able cheerexcluding, of course, the hundreds-of-thousands of Swedes who will have to die in order to keep their country free.

"Pat Robertson — longtime televangelist who founded the Christian Broadcasting Network and former presidential candidate —weighed in Monday night on the recent allegations of sexual harassment levied against Fox News Network’s Eric Bolling.
Defending Bolling, Robertson suggested that a liberal conspiracy was at the heart of those bringing such allegations against those at Fox News.
Robertson bolstered his defense of Bolling and Fox News with comments that he’s “not a conspiracy theorist,” and noted that there is a way to destroy a company in a clandestine way.
“If you wanted to destroy the Fox News, you really wanted to destroy them, what would you do?” Robertson asked. “Well, you would send some salacious material, ostensibly from one of their popular co-hosts or hosts and you’d send it out and then get it publicized and then you have some woman complain that she had gotten this salacious material from this co-host and then she would come to Fox, and Fox is so averse to any kind of legal action that they would immediately take the person off the air, so before long you would have decimated the prime-time lineup of all the Fox hosts. Easy to do? Absolutely. Is it being done? Probably.”
Robertson continued, “The latest attack is against a guy named Eric Bolling, who I think is a straight arrow. He was on this program. He’s a dedicated Catholic, goes to mass every day, very nice man. They’ve pulled him off the air because someone sent some pictures ostensibly over his name.”
Robertson then compared the treatment of Bolling to that of Bill O’Reilly and Roger Ailes.
“[T]hey got rid of O’Reilly who was the top getting of audience, the most popular host they had. Of course, they got rid of Roger Ailes, the architect who put it all together,” Robertson mused. “It’s so easy to do now. I’m not a conspiracy theorist but it’s so easy to see what’s being done. I think it’s a terrible shame. Fox had better sync up, gird up their loins; people are going after them. Anybody can send a salacious piece of literature.”
As for who Robertson believed was at the heart of the scandal, the televangelist had some ideas.
“It came from Sean Hannity, it came from anyone,” he offered. “Totally bogus.”
Bolling himself made a public statement on Monday, defending himself from the allegations of sexual harassment.
On Twitter, Bolling wrote, “Overwhelmed by all the support I have received. Thank you I look forward to clearing my name asap.”
The accusations were confirmed to the Huffington Post by 14 past and current Fox News employees, and were followed upon by corroboration from a former Fox News guest who made similar accusations against Bolling.
Bolling’s lawyer had previously released a statement threatening to sue false reports, but it didn’t make clear what portion of the report he was denying.
“Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications,” the statement read, “does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made.”
The Trump-supporting host of “The Specialists” was then suspended by Fox News as they investigate the matter.
Occidental College associate professor Caroline Heldman posted on Facebook that she had experienced what she claimed were questionable interactions with Bolling.
“Bolling would also contact me via phone and text after shows,” Heldman alleged, “sometimes to apologize for his behavior (and then do it again), and sometimes just to talk. He said he wanted to fly me out to New York for in-studio hits and to have ‘fun.’ He asked me to have meals with him on several occasions, but I found excuses not to go.”
“Once, he took me up to his office in New York,” she continued, “showed me his baseball jerseys, and in the brief time I was there, let me know that his office was his favorite place to have sex. I know other women have had similar experiences with Bolling, which means that lots of folks at Fox knew about his behavior well before 2017.”
See Robertson’s full comments in the video below.

"CNN has been full of fantasy throughout the entire campaign and to this day when reporting on Donald Trump and his campaign but now they have completely lost it!
Their President is now claiming that their credibility rating is higher than ever!
That is after a report came out saying that they were actually the LEAST Credible cables news source and people trusted them the least! See our previous story on this here.
75% of Likely U. S. Voters say they watch cable news networks for their political news at least occasionally.
Among those who tune in to cable news networks at least occasionally, 42% say Fox News is the channel they generally watch, compared to 35% who turn to CNN and 19% who prefer MSNBC.
Among cable news network viewers who watch Fox News most often, 50% say they trust the political news they are getting. That compares to 43% of MSNBC viewers and just 33% who tune in mostly to CNN.
CNN President Jeff Zucker is claiming that the only problem CNN faces is that Donald Trump is trying to dirty their name and “delegitimize journalism.”
He went on to say from The Hill:
“It doesn’t worry me that Donald Trump hasn’t done an interview with CNN in eight months. I think our credibility is higher than ever, and our viewership is higher than ever, and our reporting is as strong as ever. … Continuing to have an adversarial relationship with that network is a mistake.”
Zucker is only scared that by Donald Trump continuing his campaign to label CNN for what it really is, Fake News, then they are going to eventually have to shut their doors down.
Zucker and CNN are crazy if they believe this or they are using their own polls and we all know how well that worked for them during the election.
Share this everywhere to show who the real fake news are!",1
"Bill O’Reilly received the worst news, career-wise, a month ago after a string of sexual harassment accusations against him surfaced. Now, it looks that he is already back in the game and in a big way to say the least.
New York Daily News informed that O’Reilly is currently on demand by numerous conservative media outlets who wish to become a potential match for Fox News.
“Bill O’Reilly has been nothing short of a powerhouse in cable news. We have received thousands of requests to add Mr. O’Reilly to our team,” stated Charles Herring, CEO of San Diego-based One America Network. “I’m sure several national cable news networks have expressed strong interest in Mr. O’Reilly, and One America News is no exception, but we have no further comments at this time.”
Sources reveal that O’Reilly is also wanted by Sinclair, a massive right-leaning broadcaster that is the owner of 170 TV stations, which includes Chicago’s superstation WGN. Sinclair got himself a $3.9-million contract this month to purchase Tribune media and its 42 stations, and executives are attempting to turn WGN into a conservative all-news network that could actually compete with Fox.",1
"It’s painful for eyes and ears to see how Republican Fox News host Shepherd Smith continues to serve as a liberal mouthpiece on the network, reciting the Democratic party’s line about Donald Trump verbatim.
On his show, he said one of the most lowest smears ever about Trump of course,“There were lots of ways Russia tried to sway our vote. He testified that Russia used cyber attacks to target the Democratic National Committee — we know that. He said they also used propaganda and disinformation, including fake news.”
“Fake news that the Kremlin-commissioned and generated. In other words, a pack of lies packaged up as news of the day in an effort to saw the minds of the American electorate. We don’t need a dictionary to figure out what he’s saying. He’s saying, ‘Putin knew this, Putin directed this. This is all about Putin,” Shep added.
Then he continued, “And then today, Trump said he’s a big fan of ‘intelligence.’ Apparently not this intelligence. He’s made that clear. Because this intelligence says that Vladimir Putin and the Russians tried meddling with the U. S. election to help him, Donald Trump, get elected. But why? Does Donald Trump not trust the intelligence agencies? Or is this a thank you to the Russians for all their help? We do not know. But it’s one of those.”
Unluckily for Smith, Fox News close the doors for this kind of leftist nonsense. They proved that when the showed the door to Megyn Kelly.
According to unknowns source, the network plans are to replace her with a “Trump-supporting conservative.”
Shep just got a big Warning. His days in Fox News are numbered from now on right?",1
"Max’s parents say he loves the country singer so much that they play Bryan’s music to motivate Max to do just about anything.
“We clean the house to Luke Bryan. We get dressed in the morning to Luke Bryan. [We] brush our teeth and get out the door to Luke Bryan, and [Max] takes a Luke CD every day on his bus to school,” Max’s father, Paul Bird, told ABC News.
Max, who lives with his parents and his brother Mitchell in Iowa, has trouble with his speech, so his mother, Jaimi Bird, and Sarah Sitzmann, who are both speech pathologists, work with Max to help him communicate better. Jaimi Bird says her son has apraxia of speech.
“Many children have difficulties with certain speech sounds, and we work with them all the time as well,” Jaimi Bird told ABC News. “Apraxia of speech is a little bit more than that. It's a little more complicated in the sense that it's more a motor planning problem. And so that's why the [letters] ‘K’ and ‘G’ were so hard.”
“I help him say certain sounds,” Sitzmann told ABC News. “Pretty much after every single session, we always watch a Luke Bryan video. All I have to say is, ‘Max, what are we working for?’ And he’ll say, ‘Luke!’ So then I’ll say, 'OK! Let’s keep going.'”
One day while working with Sitzmann, Max was finally able to pronounce the sound of the letter “K,” which he wanted to accomplish so he could say, “Luke Bryan.”
“We’ve worked for over a year, and, so, I mean, I didn’t know if it would happen, and actually he got the ‘K’ on my last day working with him,” Sitzmann said.
“I can’t even tell you how it made me and Paul feel when he got a sound! I mean, we’ve been working on it for so long!” Jaimi Bird said.
Sitzmann posted a video on social media of the session when Max successfully pronounced Bryan’s name, and the clip quickly became viewed by thousands of people, including a reporter from the Des Moines Register, who wrote about Max and his love for Bryan.
Luke Bryan said he was browsing through social media when he first came across Max’s story.
“When you think about -- he’s used saying my name as one of his goals and motivation through life, it’s the highest form of flattery,” Bryan told ABC News.
Bryan and Max finally got to meet each other at Bryan’s concert in Boone, Iowa, on Sept. 30, 2017.
“When I meet a kid like him, it always puts it into perspective. I think we can get in our daily routine,” Bryan said. “But when you meet somebody like Max and the other kids I’ve met, I mean, that’s when you’re like, alright, this is good stuff.”
Bryan asked Max to say his name, and the two did a quick duet of Max’s favorite song by Bryan, “Here’s to the Farmer.”
“We all have goals; everybody has challenges. Some peoples' are bigger than others’. Max has worked really hard,” Jaimi Bird said. “He has a lot to say, and sometimes, I think people don't get that; they don't see that he has so much knowledge and so much to give and share, because they can't understand him. Now, he's a little bit closer to being understood better.”
“I'm just glad I have the ability to be out there and hopefully putting smiles on people's faces and doing positive things,” said Bryan.

"If Trump is ‘encouraging violence against reporters’ with this silly clip what were those now-fired CNN employees doing?
Or the other ‘journalists’ that are telling anti-Trump stories that even THEY are calling BS on?
Remember way back before Trump was our duly-elected President?
It seems like a long time ago already, doesn’t it? Of course, it would, what with the networks ringing the alarm bells since, basically, November 9th.
Before that, he was a celebrity in the more ordinary sense of the term. Fabulously wealthy, sure. But also knew his way around the media, to work it to build his brand.
One time, he was even involved in a promotional Wrestling match, where he gave Vince McMahan ‘a beating’. Those video clips still make the rounds sometimes.
After the credibility beat-down CNN has had between inauguration day and now — headlines are now mocking CNN’s slogan as ‘The Most Busted Name In News’ someone online put those two ideas together, with CNN on the losing end of the matchup. The guy Trump ‘beat’ has his face covered, with the CNN logo in its place.
Wrestling — as we probably need to remind anyone who still takes CNN seriously — is completely Staged. Or to say it in anther way ‘fake news’.
Journalists are now fearing for their lives. Or something.
“We will keep doing our jobs?” They say? That’s hilarious.
How do they square that with: the “that’s adorable. That’s adorable. This is business” in the context of Journalistic Ethics?
If you WERE doing your jobs, instead of pushing an endless assault on the duly-elected President who happens to oppose the person YOU tried to get the public to vote for.
We know about all the connections between the networks and the CNN. That’s why we call you fake.
They hardly bat an eye when Michael Moore tries to call for an uprising.
Or when Democrats make transparent attempts to ACTUALLY usurp power and disenfranchise half the country by undoing the results of the last election. Again, and again and again.
Or when Hollywood uses the language of war in their Resist movement. Or mock executions of Trump — including beheadings. Or the very realistic one in Shakespeare in the Park.
But let Trump tweak the media with a silly meme, and they lament as though Ceasar has just marched an army across the Rubicon.
Grow up, CNN. Do your jobs. Report the news instead of inventing it whole cloth. Hit BOTH parties equally hard and we will treat you like a news network.

"Silicon Valley goes to Washington this week. Officials from Facebook, Google and Twitter appear before Congress to talk about their social platforms and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. NPR will be bringing you stories on this all week this morning to kick things off. NPR's Laura Sydell reports on social media that was created to cause divisions in the United States linked to Russia.
LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: The first thing to know about Russian propaganda is that it doesn't say it's Russian propaganda. It might simply be a social media post, a tweet or a Facebook page about a topic that you find interesting. M'tep Blount is a supporter of Black Lives Matter. One day, she saw a group page that might have been affiliated with the movement. It was called Blacktivist.
M'TEP BLOUNT: It was on my news feed. It was, oh, you have a friend who's a part of this group. And I was like, all right. I'll look into it. It definitely had a big following...
SYDELL: ...As in over 400,000 followers in late August. The Blacktivist page was sharing information about police brutality. And videos often appeared on the page of police beating African-Americans in small towns.
BLOUNT: It was like, wow. This is happening in this community, too. I really hope they do something about it. But they probably aren't going to do.
SYDELL: As it turns out, the Blacktivist page was linked to Russia. And Facebook took it down. It doesn't seem as if the Blacktivist group was trying to change Blount's mind about anything. And it was carefully crafted to attract people like Blount whose behavior on Facebook made it clear that they mistrusted police and were concerned about civil rights.
JEFF HANCOCK: Propaganda can actually have a real effect. Even though we might already believe what we're hearing, this can heighten our arousal or our emotions.
SYDELL: Jeff Hancock is a psychologist who heads the Stanford University Social Media Lab. Hancock has studied the ways people are affected by seeing information that confirms their beliefs. In his study, he asked people how they felt about an issue before showing them stories. So he says if someone thought Hillary Clinton was corrupt, he showed posts confirming it. If people were worried about police brutality, he showed them posts of police brutalizing civilians.
HANCOCK: If I'm worried about police brutality then, you know, the more times I'm exposed to that, the stronger it makes me feel about it.
SYDELL: Hancock says this kind of propaganda is designed to enhance divisions...
HANCOCK: ...And by doing that, reduce the will to vote. The anger within each other - it really truly is just a simple divide-and-conquer approach.
SYDELL: It's an approach that Russia has frequently used around the world, says former Russian Ambassador Michael McFaul.
MICHAEL MCFAUL: They think that that leads to polarization, that leads to arguments among ourselves. And it takes us off the world stage.
SYDELL: The Russian campaign spread across all forms of social media. Take a Twitter account like @TEN_GOP, which had more than 100,000 followers. It called itself the unofficial account of the Tennessee Republican Party. But it wasn't. It was reportedly set up from Russia. The account, which has been shut down, sent out a stream of fake news such as a tweet falsely stating that there was voter fraud in Florida. The fake news got plenty of amplification. There's no evidence that President Trump or his supporters knew about the accounts linked to Russia. Still, it was retweeted by Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump Jr. And then Trump himself thanked the account for its support. Clint Watts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, has been investigating Russian use of social media.
CLINT WATTS: It has been retweeted, cited many, many times by people in the Trump campaign or Republican operatives and even in the mainstream media. And so that shows how just one account with just a lot of effort can actually influence the discussion and be cited in the debate.
SYDELL: Watt says this kind of media propaganda campaign is not exclusive to the Russians. This is simply how it works in the digital age. After every major news event, the social-media sphere starts filling up with conspiracy theories and fake news. Under pressure from Congress, Facebook has handed over a $100,000 ad campaign with 3,000 ads by Russians to Congress. It's promised more transparency about who is behind advertising campaigns. Twitter says it will no longer take ad money from two Russian media outlets. And there's still a lot we don't know about the use of digital platforms. But we may have a chance to learn more when Twitter, Facebook and Google sit down to answer questions in front of Congress later this week. Laura Sydell, NPR News.

"When the media rushed to the scene of the attack at Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, photographer Furkan Temir took a moment to mentally prepare before going in.
Temir was born and raised in Turkey and has become all too familiar with these catastrophic scenes of violence. He has been photographing the aftermath of terrorist attacks since he was a teenager.
“I feel the responsibility,” said the 21-year-old. “I would like to tell our story.”
An employee at Istanbul's Ataturk airport cries after hearing an explosion.
At least 44 people were killed in the airport attack, and nearly 240 were wounded.
This is starting to become a grim reality for the people of Turkey, where there have already been at least seven other deadly attacks this year.
Some, like the airport bombings, have been linked to the ISIS militant group. Others have been linked to a Kurdish insurgency that the government has been fighting since July.
A man rides a ferry across the Bosphorus. Photographer Furkan Temir says many people tend to stay home in the immediate aftermath of terror attacks.
Temir spoke about this constant threat, saying many Turks are holding their breath, just waiting for the next attack.
“Right after these bombings,” he said, “the whole country is in shock. … Most of the time, people don’t go outside for the next few days because they are afraid.
“After one week, normal life is starting to (return), but after one month (people fear) another (attack) is coming and everything turns back again.”
Just six months ago, 13 people were killed in a suicide bombing here at the Sultanahmet Square in Istanbul.
A nurse rides public transportation into work.
The entrance to the Vezneciler subway stop, where there was a deadly explosion earlier this month.
Temir spent two days photographing Istanbul and its people in the aftermath of the airport tragedy.
Like many of his peers, he is well-equipped to tell these stories as he knows the context, history and cadence of daily life in Turkey. When breaking news hits close to home, he does not frantically dart into the fray of coverage; he thoughtfully approaches people, talks with them and earnestly asks how they are feeling before he raises his camera.
He arrived at the airport early Wednesday, hours after the attack began, and the premises were already being cleaned to reopen for business.
Passengers wait for their delayed flights.
Some of the airport security, many of whom just lived through the traumatic experience, were asked to stay and continue working. One airport worker was heading home when she heard another blast. Temir witnessed her breakdown as she screamed and crumpled to the floor. “Enough!” she sobbed. “I just want to go home.”
Temir said the government temporarily blocked social media for security reasons. But this also inhibited people from being able to communicate.
“We were not allowed to use Facebook, and because of that we couldn’t easily get the news,” he said.

In the aftermath of the attack, many media organizations broadcasted live from outside a hospital.
The next day, Temir went to two different funerals — one for taxi drivers who were killed and another for airport workers. Many of the airport employees left work for 30 minutes to attend the funeral.
Temir said the experience was emotional, as close to 500 people crowded next to one another shoulder to shoulder, tears streaming down their faces and palms turned upright in prayer as officials spoke and read passages from the Quran.
Funerals are held for some of the taxi drivers who lost their lives in the attack.
One of the worst parts in the aftermath of a terrorist attack is the weight of suspicion burdening innocent people in Turkey, the photographer said.
“People are looking at each other like suspects. If you are wearing a leather jacket in the summer, or if you have a beard … it’s so confusing because everybody is afraid of everything and everyone.”
Even as Temir travels around for assignments, he sees police become stressed as they eye his bulky bag, slung over his shoulder, carrying his camera equipment and laptop.

He can’t remember the last time he felt light and at peace out in the streets of Istanbul. He points back to a few years ago before the Gezi Park protests.
But even then, he says, it was not really freedom. “It’s complicated.”
He knows ISIS is the whole world’s problem and that Turkey isn’t fighting that battle alone.
“When something happens in Turkey, I always see it in the magazines and newspapers,” he said. “When the attack comes from ISIS, the world reacts.”
A memorial is held for airport personnel who lost their lives.
Many parts of the airport were damaged in the attack.
Flowers are seen at the memorial for the airport workers.
And he is not worried about devout Muslims whose faith remains unshaken from the terrorists who try to twist it.
When asked what his hope was for Turkey and where people would go from here, Temir was silent for a moment and then drew breath slowly.
“At this moment, it’s really hard to say anything because we are almost sure that next month will be another suicide bombing,” he said.
“I don’t know how it will end, but hopefully it will end.”

"The family of the still-missing first wife of infamous millionaire and murder suspect Robert Durst has taken a step toward a wrongful death lawsuit against the real-estate heir, it was revealed Thursday.
The brother of Kathleen McCormack Durst filed a petition to become administrator of her estate, according to his lawyer and court documents obtained by NBC News.
Kathleen mysteriously disappeared one night in the winter of 1982 while she was married to Robert. She has never been found and no one was ever charged in connection with the case.
James McCormack is seeking authority over Kathleen's estate in place of their 102-year-old mother, Ann Catherine McCormack.
""The reason James McCormack wishes to be appointed administrator at this time is to commence a possible wrongful death action against the decedent's husband, Robert Durst,"" Alex Spiro, McCormack's lawyer, wrote in the petition filed in Surrogate's Court of New York County on Thursday.
""He did it, and we can prove it,"" Spiro told NBC News.
Durst was widely suspected in Kathleen’s disappearance in January 1982. The two had a tumultuous marriage, and in 1981 Kathleen accused him of physical abuse and filed for divorce.
Durst reported his wife missing and was questioned, but never charged in her disappearance.
Michael Struk, a New York police sergeant at the time, told NBC News in 2008 that while Durst was suspected, ""there was never any conclusive evidence as to whether a crime had even been committed.""
A body has never been found in the case, but Kathleen was legally declared dead in 2001.
Robert Durst is no stranger to being at the center of mysterious deaths and disappearances. He was arrested this March in Louisiana on an out-of-state warrant in connection with the 2000 murder of confidante Susan Berman in Los Angeles.
""Anybody can file a lawsuit, but you have to have evidence and there is no evidence. There's a craftily edited television show and there’s nothing else.""
Durst was arrested the day before the finale of the six-part HBO documentary ""The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst."" The series delved into his possible connection to Berman's death, as well as Kathleen’s disappearance and the 2001 death and dismemberment of his neighbor Morris Black.
Durst, who became a fugitive and then was caught before the trial, claimed self-defense in Black's death and a jury found him not guilty.
In the finale of the documentary, Durst appeared to confess to the killings as he wore a hot microphone.
While Durst was in the bathroom, he was recorded by HBO saying to himself, ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.""
Durst's defense attorney, Dick DeGuerin, told NBC News there was no evidence linking his client to the death of Kathleen.
""Anybody can file a lawsuit, but you have to have evidence and there is no evidence,"" he said. ""There's a craftily edited television show and there’s nothing else.""
Durst remains in Louisiana federal prison on gun and drug charges stemming from his March 14 arrest.",0
"Now that she’s no longer feeding debate questions to Dear Leader in advance, suddenly she’s disposable.
This is why the Liberal ‘us and them’ game is so corrosive to society.
If you are a ‘person of color’ they LOVE you. Right? Even a wannabe ‘person of color’ who happens to have the right politics. They love”Pocahontas” (Elizabeth Warren). They love Talcum X (Shaun King) who had to call his mom a slut to try to push the claim that — no really — he IS black. And of course, Rachael “race is a social construct” (but I’m still going to be a race-baiter) Dolezal. She sued Howard in 2002 for discrimination ‘because she is a white woman’ but somehow later would run the NAACP. In October 2016 Dolezal legally changed her name to Nkechi Amare Diallo.
Well, they love you unless you are one of those no-good, low-down slugs who disagree with the party line, and are obviously unfit to be considered one of ‘us’ by the guardians of the clubhouse.
That’s why people like Larry Elder, Herman Cain, Condoleeza Rice, Dr. Ben Carson and other high-profile RIGHT-leaning Personalities.
And God forbid you are someone of special prominence like Clarence Thomas or Thomas Sewell. You get called all sorts of mean names.
Uncle Tom is one of the LEAST cruel names of the bunch.
What happens as soon as you are a liability to the cause?
You don’t need to look any further than Dolezal. By February of this year, Dolezal was on food stamps. Why? She was no longer a useful voice for The Cause. She had become a liability. Dead weight.
And she was thrown overboard by the ‘compassionate’ party. Just like so many unionized blue-collar workers had been forgotten and neglected before her, as they gathered around shiny new ’causes’.
Donna Brazile — having turned on Hillary, and thrown her under the Campaign bus — just received the same treatment herself.
And if she had been treated by the GOP the way she was treated by her fellow Democrats, it would be headline news Just imagine how these quotes would be reported:
She also said she “got sick and tired of people trying to tell me how to spend money” as DNC chair, when she “wasn’t getting a salary. I was basically volunteering my time”.
“I’m not Patsey the slave,” Brazile said, referring to a character in the Oscar-winning film 12 Years a Slave.
Source: The Guardian
Can you imagine if a whistleblower on the Republican side were making claims like this? It would be denounced on every news show as proof of racism.
Does ‘racism’ rightly describe the Democrats’ harsh treatment of Donna Brazile?
Does your grandpa go off on paltry politicians, whether they be Democrats or Republicans? Does he get misty eyed when he talks about God and Country and America’s future? And have you ever heard him scream, ‘Awww … Hell no!’ when Rosie O’Donnell starts yapping on television? If you answered yes to one, or all of the above, then your gramps will love Doug Giles’ latest book, My Grandpa Is A Patriotic Badass.
Don’t be fooled by the title — this ain’t just for Grandpa.
The Snowflake Generation — and the rest of America — needs a good ol’ dose of ‘Grandpa wisdom’.
Especially if that Grandpa is Doug Giles.
You’ll love My Grandpa Is A Patriotic Badass just as much as Grandpa will.
Even Mark Twain wanted to drain the swamp!

"The television reporter who claims Harvey Weinstein exposed himself in front of her says the Hollywood giant ordered her to ""just stand there and be quiet"" while he masturbated.
The encounter happened a decade ago, said the reporter, Lauren Sivan, and is the latest accusation of misconduct against Weinstein. Sivan was in her 20s at the time, anchoring for a cable channel, News 12 Long Island, and she said she told friends about it when it happened — but was hesitant to go public before now.
""I didn't know what going public would do for me,"" Sivan, who is now an anchor for Fox 11 in Los Angeles, told Megyn Kelly on Monday on ""TODAY.""
But Sivan says she decided to share her story following a New York Times report last week that detailed decades of accusations of sexual harassment by the powerful producer. Actress Ashley Judd is among those who spoke to The Times.
Sivan first spoke to the HuffPost about the incident, which she said happened after she met Weinstein and others at Manhattan's Cipriani restaurant. She said Weinstein pulled a chair up to her and was ""complimenting me, telling me how impressed he was with what I do.""
""It was this really warm conversation,"" Sivan told Kelly. ""I was just a local reporter at the time, and to be able to talk to this huge Hollywood mogul at the time — it felt great.""
The group then went to a restaurant Weinstein owned, where he offered to give her a tour of the kitchen, Sivan said. Instead of finding a bustling kitchen when Weinstein and Sivan got down there, Sivan said there were just a couple people sweeping — who Weinstein shooed away. Sivan said ""red flags"" went up.
""That's when he cornered me in this vestibule and leaned in and tried to kiss me, which I immediately rebuffed, and said, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, I had no idea what this was, I'm sorry, I have a very serious boyfriend and I'm not interested,'"" Sivan said. ""I thought it would end there.""
Instead, Sivan says, Weinstein refused to let her leave.
""That's when he blocked the entrance,"" she said, ""And said, 'Just stand there and be quiet.'""
Shocked, Sivan said she ""stood there dumbfounded"" as Weinstein exposed himself and began masturbating.
""I could not believe what I was witnessing. It was disgusting and kind of pathetic, really,"" she said. ""But more than the disgusting act itself, which of course was gross, the demeaning part of it all — that just 20 minutes earlier, he was having this great conversation with me, and I felt so great and flattered by it.""
Weinstein was fired from the studio he co-founded on Sunday. He has not responded to NBC News, which has not confirmed the allegations published by the New York Times. In a statement issued last Thursday following The Times article, Weinstein has said, ""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.""
Hollywood fixture Meryl Streep, who has worked with Weinstein on several blockbuster films, slammed the producer in a statement Monday.
""The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes,"" Streep said in a statement to the HuffPost.
Streep, who famously joked that Weinstein was a ""God"" at the 2012 Golden Globes awards, called his alleged actions ""inexcusable.""
""The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game,"" her statement said.
Sivan said she wasn't surprised other women had similar stories.
""I was lucky enough to never have to deal with him again. I didn't work with him, I didn't need anything from him,"" she said.
Other women, particularly actresses, had more at stake, she added.
""You have to understand, he was a titan in Hollywood. He could ruin people's careers if he didn't like you.""
Speaking with NBC News after her appearance on Megyn Kelly TODAY, Sivan reflected more on why she didn't go to authorities or speak publicly about her allegations before.
""He's a huge, powerful man, and I don't think any woman wanted to be the one woman to come out, out of fear of retribution,"" she said. ""In my case, I didn't want to be known as the girl he exposed himself to.""
CORRECTION (Oct. 9, 1 p.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated Sivan's job status. She is currently a Fox 11 reporter in Los Angeles; she is not a former television reporter.",0

Emergency Request For Press Freedom Award
To: Committee to Protect JournalistsInternational Press Freedom Award
National Council of Teachers of EnglishGeorge Orwell Award
To Whom It May Concern:
We are writing to you today to urgently request that your esteemed organizations immediately issue press freedom awards to the 200 American websites that have been branded and blacklisted by the US mainstream media as being fake news Russian propaganda organizations without either the presentation of any evidence to support this claim, or even allowing any of these sites to avail themselves of any type of due process to counter this charge.
In what Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Glen Greenwald has called journalistic garbage[1], the Washington Post this past week in their article titled Russian Propaganda Effort Helped Spread Fake News During Election, Experts Say[2] began supporting a McCarthyite Blacklist[3] of over 200 American alternative news websites based solely upon evidence created by an anonymous and shadowy group named PropOrNot.com[4] that created The List of sites to be blacklisted.[5]
The list of sites being blacklisted as fake news and Russian propaganda consists of some of the largest alternative news websites in America, like Drudgereport.com that is the 103rd most viewed site[6] in the US, and some of its least viewedlike Libertyblitzkrieg.com[7] whose single blogger and site webmaster upon learning he was blacklisted wrote:
Despite the fact that my site is mentioned on the list, nobody from PropOrNot bothered to contact me while doing their research. They couldve asked very simple questions about how the site is run, who owns it, and who makes decisions about editorial content. Furthermore, I doubt they did any such research with regard to any of the mentioned sites before slandering them.
Since they failed to do any real work, let me answer several of these questions. I, Michael Krieger, am the 100% owner of Liberty Blitzkrieg. I am the only person who makes decisions on what to publish and when. I have absolutely no connections, financial or otherwise, to the Russian government, Russian interests, or the interests of any other government or government related group.[8]
Should Mr Krieger, or any other person, seek redress from being blacklisted by PropOrNot.com as Russian fake news propagandists, they are met by these chilling words from this shadowy sites anonymous experts should they seek to contact them: If you're a Russian troll, though, don't bother. We'll just ban you.[9]
Following the Washington Post giving mainstream media respectability to the PropOrNot.com blacklist, other such American mainstream news sites quickly followed doing the sameincluding Slate.com[10], PBS News Hour[11], Mediate.com[12], and Salon.com[13], to just name a few.
With both Google and Facebook now taking aim against what they call fake news sites[14], it doesnt take an expert to know that these 200 American alternative websites that are now being blacklisted as Russian propagandists will be the first to be targeted for oblivion and revenue denialbut whose only crime were those of writing, publishing and disseminating articles counter to and critical of the existing US mainstream media power structures narrative.
This past week, Philippe Leruth, as the President of International Federation of Journalists[15], said in response to the EUs attack on Russian media with its recent anti-propaganda resolution:  You should give them the right to defend themselves, and second, you should show exactly what you mean by saying they are doing propaganda.[16]
Likewise, these over 200 American blacklisted alternative news sites have had no right to defend themselves, nor has anyone shown them why they are now being labeled as propagandists.
To the elite media and journalistic power structures your organizations represent, these 200 American blacklisted alternative websites are nothing more than low hanging fruitbut ask yourselves, once they are destroyed, who do you think will be next?
In medical terms there is one used called Patient Zero[17] that is defined as the first case of a condition or syndromeand that if found could stop a pandemic from occurring thus saving millions of lives.
This blacklist is your Patient Zeroand unless you, and others of journalistic integrity like you, cure this disease it will, most assuredly, metastasize and destroy all press freedom the world over.
Therefore, and in conclusion, I respectfully request that your organizations create and provide to these 200 American alternative news websites that are being blacklisted an Emergency Award Banner that can be displayed on their sites and that link back to your statement of support for press freedom of all kinds.
To defend the right of journalists to report the news without fear of reprisal is either what you truly stand for or you stand for nothing at all.
Sincerely,
Sorcha Faal

"In yet another sign that the “Russia hacked the election” narrative is phony,Buzzfeed is reporting that the FBI never even bothered to ask for the DNC server for forensic analysis.
Now, why would the worlds top investigative agency miss an obvious step like that? It reminds one of all the highly unusual and favorable treatment accorded to Hillary and friends during that other email ‘investigation.’
The FBI did not examine the servers of the Democratic National Committee before issuing a report attributing the sweeping cyberintrusion to Russia-backed hackers, BuzzFeed News has learned.
Six months after the FBI first said it was investigating the hack of the Democratic National Committee’s computer network, the bureau has still not requested access to the hacked servers, a DNC spokesman said. No US government entity has run an independent forensic analysis on the system, one US intelligence official told BuzzFeed News.
“The DNC had several meetings with representatives of the FBI’s Cyber Division and its Washington (DC) Field Office, the Department of Justice’s National Security Division, and U. S. Attorney’s Offices, and it responded to a variety of requests for cooperation, butthe FBI never requested access to the DNC’s computer servers,”Eric Walker, the DNC’s deputy communications director, told BuzzFeed News in an email.
This strongly suggests that the conclusion that Russia “hacked” (the correct term would be “phished”) the server preceded the examination of evidence, since the evidence still has not yet been fully examined.
The FBI has a huge budget and touts itself as the premier investigative agency in the world. Its crime labs and forensic computer capabilities are supposed to be the best in the world. In a matter of national security and political significance, outsourcing to a private firm in reaching investigative conclusions is simply too weird to be believed. It might be one thing to bring in outside specialized laboratory resources to produce data. But outsourcing investigative conclusions is ridiculous. That is the job of law enforcement.
Another important question: why did the Obama administration do nothing about the MORE SERIOUS breach of government personnel records by the Chinese? Why the double standard? Watch the lame and defensive response to that question from ABC’s Jon Karl:
This politically convenient narrative is falling apart. Buzzfeed is no conservative site. I take this report as a sign that smart lefties are getting on the side of skepticism.
I hope President-Elect Trump pushes FBI director James Comey to explain why his agency never bothered with the fundamentals of evidence examination before reaching conclusions.",1
"ISIS’ surprising claim, without evidence, that it was responsible for the mass shooting in Las Vegas prompted very different news treatments from different outlets on Monday — with some perhaps unintentionally fueling the terrorist organization’s desire for publicity.
While standard-bearers like The New York Times and The Washington Post mentioned ISIS’ claims only in the text of their larger stories on the shooting — not running individual articles on them — other outlets blared big headlines. There was particular enthusiasm for reporting on the claims at some right-leaning sites, like the Daily Caller, which on Monday morning briefly streaked the banner headline “BREAKING NEWS: ISIS Claims Shooter Converted To Islam Before Attack.”
Further out on the spectrum, InfoWars ran a lead story with the claim. The Gateway Pundit also played it prominently. Hours after the FBI said Monday that, as of yet, it had found no evidence connecting the shooter to international terror groups, the site displayed a headline reading: “ISIS Doubles Down On Vegas Attack Responsibility After FBI Denial—Warn Those Who Reject Claim Will ‘Regret’ It.”
Treatments of the claims did not break down cleanly along ideological lines, however. Breitbart cast a skeptical eye, noting ISIS’ lack of evidence in the headline of its own story on the claim. Fox News was also more reserved in its online coverage, treating the claims much like the Times and Post.
The Associated Press, Newsweek and the New York Daily News, among others, ran headlines along the lines of, “Islamic State claims Las Vegas mass shooting.” But they weren't played up as much as those on some more ideological sites, and they generally included crucial context about the lack of evidence.
Regardless of whether ISIS had any connection to the attack, some experts said the mere existence of all of the stories could represent a victory for the terrorist group. Given how headlines spread around social media and the internet — often finding audiences that want to believe ISIS’ claims — some people are now sure to believe that ISIS was in fact behind one of the deadliest shootings in American history.
“Their followers are going to believe it no matter what, because they’re not going to believe the Western media, and it keeps their name relevant,” said Colin Clarke, a political scientist and terrorism expert for Rand Corp. “And it scares the crap out of people like my mom and dad.”
Headlines reporting the claims are, strictly speaking, accurate. But, because of the way people scan through social media feeds, Clarke said he would have preferred that news outlets pointed out that ISIS provided no evidence to support its statements, or that the shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, did not fit the normal pattern of ISIS-inspired militants.
“If I were a journalist, I would hesitate to make the ISIS claim a headline; the attack is the headline,” said Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who has written a book on ISIS. “If it’s a false claim whose only purpose is (a) uphold ISIS’ internal support base and, (b), to continue this perception that ISIS might be this big enemy and big threat, then we would be playing into ISIS’ hands.”
In the past, ISIS’ claims have generally had truth to them, but lately the group has made two high-profile false claims — one for an attack on a hotel in the Philippines and the other for placing a bomb at Charles de Gaulle Airport in France. In the Las Vegas case, in addition to the FBI statements, veteran ISIS watchers like the Times’ Rukmini Callimachi have cast doubt on the ISIS claims.
Regardless of the truth behind those claims, Clarke believes that, as the group suffers territorial setbacks, it could be focusing more on influencing the media narrative. “I think frankly there’s a lot of people in this country that want to believe them and will use it for their own agenda,” Clarke said of the claims.
Geoffrey Ingersoll, editor in chief of The Daily Caller, defended his site’s coverage in an email. “ISIS claiming anything through official channels, like they did, is big news. As soon as the disputes came, we updated the story and wrote another post on the FBI.”
He added that the banner headline was up for only 30 minutes. “We had both ‘ISIS Claims’ and ‘FBI Disputes’ headlines on the front page within an hour of each other. As soon as the [intelligence community] disputed, we updated the ISIS claims post.”
Still, the existence of the headlines allowed stories to spread around social media. On Twitter, some questioned whether news outlets should be reporting it at all.
An AP spokesperson said the wire service’s story put the issue in proper context.

"According to court filings made by the Berkeley school district,organizations such as ANTIFA are brainwashing students to violently protest free speech.
Following the recent spate of anti-free speech protests in the area, organizations such as ANTIFA and BAMN have come under fire for deliberately provokingviolence and recruiting students to stircivil unrest.
But most people forget that these events are often organized by BAMN, also known as “By Any Means Necessary,” a far-left militant group that has been around since 1995.
And the Berkeley school district is well aware of their antics, especially in regards to Yvette Felarka, a middle school teacher who is a prominent member of the group.
According to court filings made by the school district, she frequently tries to indoctrinate and recruit students into her organization during school hours. She’s been disciplined many times by the school district, and has even been fired.
However, she often responds by rallying student protests that always force the school district to buckle, and reinstate her.
And according to a letter delivered to Felarka, and written by the Berkeley Unified School District: “it was evident that you and your [By Any Means Necessary] representatives were actively trying to brainwash and manipulate these young people to serve your own selfish interests in not being held accountable to the same rules that apply to everyone else.
As a teacher, your conduct was particularly reprehensible.”
That shouldn’t come as a surprise. The term “brainwashing” is entirely appropriate. BAMN has been accused on multiple occasions of being a violent cult that indoctrinates young members and separates them from their families.
And the fact that even the Berkeley Unified School District (surely a bastion of progressive values) is tired of their craziness, speaks volumes.",1
"All throughout last season, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick made a spectacle of himself. Now he’s complaining that no one wants to hire him.
According to several different outlets, Kaepernick, who is now a free agent for the first time in his career, is getting the cold shoulder from the league’s manyorganizations. One anonymous AFC general manager chalked Kaepernick’s cold reception up to three things: 1) he can’t play at a high performance level anymore, 2) owners fear his presence will cause a backlash among the fanbase, and 3) owners and organizations simply hate him. (viaThe Mercury News).
Expanding on the third point, the unnamed AFC general manager said: “They [the NFL owners] want nothing to do with him. They won’t move on. They think showing no interest is a form of punishment. I think some teams also want to use Kaepernick as a cautionary tale to stop other players in the future from doing what he did.”
Beginning during the pre-season, Kaepernick began kneeling or sitting during the playing of the National Anthem. When this disrespect was noticed, Kaepernick was all-too-eager to explain himself to the media.
Kaepernick essentially parroted the verbal garbage of Black Lives Matter in protesting against racial discrimination and police brutality, via CBS News.
Kaepernick further highlighted his political ideology by attending press conferences in outfits referencing Malcolm X and Fidel Castro.
In a celebrated moment during the 2016 season, Kaepernick’s public adorationof the communist dictator Castro, as someone who improved Cuba’s racial relations and its literacy rate, earned him an enemy in Kiko Alonso.
The Dolphins linebacker, who is Cuban-American,said that Kaepernick’s actions created feelings of “bad blood” between the two. (viaThe Washington Post).
When Alonso sacked Kaepnerick during the fourth quarter of a game that was held right after Castro’s death, he became an instant hero to Americans of all stripes.
One of the more under-reported parts of the last year’s Kaepernick drama was his relationship with Islam. Specifically, in August of 2016, conservative blogger Pat Dollard revealed that Kaepernick’s social media posts indicated that he had converted, via Pat Dollard.com
Dollard chalked up this interest in the virulently anti-American faith to Kaepernick’s girlfriend, radio personality Nessa Diab. Diab, a Muslim, is known for her support of Black Lives Matter.
Frankly, who cares what happens to Kaepernick? If anything, his actions last year served as a wake-up call to millions of Americans suffering from pro-football addiction. Kaepernick exposed the fact that many of our overpaid athletes hate middle-America and willingly promote gangsterism, Islam, and black radicalism. Good riddance!",1
"As anchor of the CBS Evening News in the 1980s, Dan Rather's catchphrase “courage,” and other homespun bromides, struck some as the awkward musings of a man struggling to escape the shadow of his predecessor, the legendary Walter Cronkite.
Rather ultimately left the network under a cloud, two years after a controversial 2004 reportquestioningPresident George W. Bush’s service in the Texas Air National Guard.
But now, little more than a decade later, Rather is having a moment.
At the age of 86, Rather has become a millennial darling, with a Facebook page followed and ""liked'' by millions. He frequently appears on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show.And Rather's new book of original essays,What Unites Us: Reflections on Patriotism(Algonquin, 274 pp.,★★★ out of four),written with journalist Elliot Kirschner, is profoundly topical.
Rather’s riffs on topics ranging from voting rights,to immigration, to the arts bear the tone of a gentle lecture. His roots as a dogged correspondent, who covered the Civil Rights Movement, Watergate and the war in Vietnam, are on vivid display as he backs up his point of view with bits of history, and occasionally seeks to shed light on perspectives that might be different fromhis own.
In an essay on science, for instance, we learn that there are scholars who believe the rhythms of Thomas Jefferson’s contributions to the Declaration of Independence are rooted in the axioms of Euclid. But that is just a side note to Rather's plainspoken, yet passionate, defense of science as being vital to this country's founding principles, teaching Americans to ponder and question.Even the idea of the United States is rooted in wonder, he says, because what is democracy if not an experiment?
To be sure there is judgment in these pages,most sharply of a toxic political atmosphere thatrevels in divisiveness. But there is also an unvarnished honesty, about Rather's own naivete about racism growing up in a working-class corner of segregated East Texas; about a media elite to which he once belonged that givesequal weight to opposing points of view, even when one of the arguments is not credible —as in the denial of climate change —in order to appear balanced.
Perhaps Rather's most powerful essays center on the ideas of inclusion and empathy. Hewrites that too often Americans revel in self-congratulation for merely being tolerantwhen true integration remains elusive. He notes with matter-of-fact prose the lack of compassion that is particularly evident among the most powerful, who assign their privileged status more to good character than good luck, and act as though poverty and misfortune are the faultof those who bear it.
Rather's writing shows why he has won theadmiration of a new generation. In these essays, he gives voice to the marginalizedand rips off the journalistic shield of objectivity to ring the alarm bell when he witnesses actionshe fears undermine the principles of American democracy. That, undoubtedly, is patriotic.",0

‘I Want to Explode’ — A Roger Ailes Protégé Bares His Soul
Joe Lindsley was as close to the late Fox News chairman as anybody. Now, for the first time, he’s giving his account of their dramatic split.
For two years, as an ambitious twentysomething, Joe Lindsley had a closer relationship with Roger Ailes than any Fox News executive. He lived, for a time, on the Aileses' property in upstate New York, vacationed with Ailes and his wife, Beth, and served in effect as a surrogate son. Ailes’ secretary even leaned on Fox News staffers and on-air talent to make themselves available as dates for Lindsley, who, starting in 2009, served as editor-in-chief for two newspapers Ailes had purchased in upstate New York—and, apart from the Aileses, led a relatively isolated life there.
But then Lindsley suddenly decided to leave, throwing the then 71-year-old media mogul into a panic. Ailes was so furious about his departure that he tried to ensure Lindsley could never work as a journalist in Washington. Or, at least, that’s what he told Bill Kristol shortly after Lindsley’s departure.
Lindsley had come to Ailes from Kristol’s Weekly Standard, where he had served as a research assistant to the magazine’s executive editor, Fred Barnes. His dramatic exit was widely reported at the time because, those news reports alleged, News Corporation security guards tailed him through the Hudson Valley’s quaint local towns, seeking either to lure him back or to shut him up.
Ailes’ relationship with Lindsley was all the more extraordinary because the late Fox News chief didn’t cultivate protégés—he decapitated them. Since the founding of Fox News in 1996, several executives who had served a rung beneath him had found themselves suddenly exiled to the outer reaches of the network or fired outright. But Lindsley, four decades Ailes’ junior, was different. Ailes treated him like a son, laid out a promising path for his advancement, and, according to Lindsley, introduced him to people as “Ailes Jr.”
When Ailes died this year of complications after slipping in his bathroom, few people had more insight into the man and, in retrospect, Lindsley’s departure from Ailes’ orbit foreshadowed the sensational events that led to his demise.
Shortly after Lindsley’s departure in 2011, alarmed by what his newly liberated deputy might say, Ailes, at a meeting in his office at News Corporation headquarters in Manhattan and again in subsequent phone conversations, pressed Kristol to blackball Lindsley in Washington media circles, according to several sources familiar with the conversation. Kristol told Ailes he didn’t have the power to do that. When Kristol’s Fox News contract expired at the end of 2012, the network did not renew it, and his relationship with the network was permanently severed.
Now, a little more than six years after Ailes’ failed attempts to silence and banish him, Lindsley has written a novelistic memoir about the two years he spent at Ailes’ side. He spoke with POLITICO in his first on-the-record interview since he left Ailes’ employ in April 2011.
“I would wake up in the middle of the night shouting, ‘I gotta tell this story,” Lindsley says. “When I left Fox, I was not beholden. I had never signed nondisclosure papers; I was in a unique position.”

He has spent the past 2 1/2 years writing Fake News, True Story, a process he describes as an unburdening as well as a psychological reckoning of the sort Ailes would never have allowed.
“When Ailes was at the top of his game, he was raging at something—everything would melt out of his way. And I was the same way. I considered rage my chief talent,” Lindsley says. “The rage was a cover for deep wounds that were never healed, that were never even addressed.”
The most puzzling thing about the book is that Lindsley couldn’t find anybody to publish it. Instead, he’s using the self-publishing platform Inkshares to get the manuscript out. If he can sell 750 advance copies, Inkshares will edit, publish and distribute the book. When this article went to print, he had sold 176.
The publishing industry has hardly shied away from Fox News memoirs. HarperCollins is seeking more than $1 million from Ailes’ estate—the hefty advance the publisher had paid the 77-year-old media titan, who died in May, for an autobiography he will never deliver. His immediate successor as Fox News president, Bill Shine, who has since been ousted and is the subject of numerous lawsuits, is currently shopping a memoir even though he is constrained by a tight nondisclosure agreement, according to a publishing executive and a Fox News employee. And Megyn Kelly retroactively added a chapter to her book, Settle for More, before it hit the printer when Ailes’ ouster from Fox opened an avenue for her to recount sexual harassment she said she had suffered at the network.
Lindsley is calling his book a memoir, but it takes an unusual format. Written in the third person—he says the protagonist, Jack Renard, who becomes an apprentice to Roger Ailes, is his alter ego—it lands somewhere between memoir and roman à clef. It opens as Renard has a flashback induced by a bout of post-traumatic stress disorder, itself induced by his experiences with Ailes—so the book almost begs readers to question its veracity. During Renard’s first meeting with Ailes, the Fox chief declares, “The President of the United States”—Barack Obama, of course—“is a terrorist.”
And though Ailes himself doesn’t get a pseudonym, others do. Lindsley writes, for example, about network anchor Susie Sunseed, whose “exposed, tanned, toned, smooth legs sway gently underneath her clear glass desk.” He changed names and personal details to protect the privacy of friends and former colleagues, he says.
One publishing executive to whom the book was pitched—Lindsley’s agent, Matt Guma, shopped the book extensively throughout the Manhattan publishing world, and has represented the likes of Jay-Z, the Dave Matthews Band and Usain Bolt—said the book reads like “somebody having a manic episode” and left him uncertain what was real and what was made up.

As far as Lindsley is concerned, that’s precisely the point. He doesn’t disguise the fact that the bookwriting process, and the book itself, was part of a long recovery that is still running its course. The experiences of young women subject to the Fox News Channel’s sex-fueled culture have drawn interest, but Lindsley makes evident there is at least one young man whose life was deeply affected by the paranoid culture of the network and its chief executive.
There’s also the element of sour grapes. Lindsley let me read only two chapters of his book, one of which is also available online, but it’s clear he did not part with the Aileses on good terms. Lindsley wouldn’t speculate on why he thought publishers turned down the book, but he did say: “I have to remember why I fled the stagnant, vapid, stifling old world of media, where Ailes’ Fox reigned supreme.”
The emotional toll of Lindsley’s experience is evident in the book, spilling out in purple prose. “I am hounded by images, by fears, by phantoms. My head hurts, the café around me spins, my chest tightens. I want to explode, cry, shout, punch. I want to yell like a madman, ‘What have we wrought!’” he writes. “I type one word, then another, each one a stepping stone to a semblance of sanity.”
Renard’s breaking point with Ailes comes during a conversation with the media titan on a day Renard had taken off after a bitter editorial disagreement. He is badly hungover. Ailes calls him to ask, rhetorically, “You in church praying for answers?”
“Well, maybe God’s not home,” Ailes tells Renard. “He’s not home today. I heard from Him. He’s busy. He doesn’t have time for you.” He goes on to tell the impressionable young journalist that truth doesn’t exist—only narratives. “That’s why we have five Supreme Court justices,” he declares. “Everything must be made into a narrative … Facts don’t matter.” Then he invites him to dinner at the Olive Garden.
In person, Lindsley’s breathing is labored, something he attributes to anxiety. At 34, he is almost completely gray. A former high-school track star, he now has a stocky build, and he jokes that under Ailes’ tutelage, he began to look like the guy, too. In the book, Renard describes Ailes thusly: “His bejowledness gave him a natural commanding presence, like Winston Churchill, Orson Welles, Henry VIII, Gerard Depardieu, or Cowboys Stadium. The globular wideness contributed to his narrative-mystery, like the mystery of the moon, and his narrative-mystery gave him power. Though prone to anger and impatience, he could also be quite jolly. He could live and laugh in a way that lean, treadmill-running individuals, for whom life is one constant stress test, cannot. This aura of jolliness surrounding a bitter, angry, and perhaps fearfully sad core made him absolutely mysterious and hence ferociously powerful.”
Reading Fake News, True Story, it’s hard to tell where real life ends and the novel begins. Lindsley is coy about the details of the experience: He wants people to buy the book. But he says that, living in Roger’s world, he felt himself taking on Ailes’ attributes—not just physically but emotionally. “I would wake up in the middle of the night with these realizations of who I had been and how I was changing. On a basic level, you could say I was driven by a brilliant rage … but I had a spiritual inner level of knowing I wanted to be a different person, I didn’t want to live being governed by rage and hate,” he says.
A Notre Dame graduate and a devout Catholic, Lindsley is a student of the great books and of conservative doctrine. He is a more serious reader and thinker than the rank-and-file Fox News staffer—and for that reason, perhaps, was more likely to revolt. He also had big ambitions and an old-school love of the newspaper business. “I was a newspaper guy, I never was a big TV watcher. I loved newspapers, and that was the thing I jumped at in working for Ailes.”
Lindsley told me that, though he remains a conservative, he doesn’t think highly of Fox News—and it’s not clear how much his anger and regrets color his retelling of events. “It’s a disservice to good reporters and a disservice to the republic when they claim to be a fantastic news source,” he says of the network.
Living in Cold Spring, New York, and isolated from people his own age, Lindsley threw himself into his work, redesigning the Ailes newspapers and transforming them into partisan broadsheets. He made national news when the New Yorker’s Peter Boyer chronicled the vicious dispute playing out over Ailes’ acquisition and transformation of the newspapers he was editing, the Putnam County News & Recorder and the Putnam County Courier. The town’s liberals were in open revolt against the Ailes family and against Lindsley himself. They launched a competing outlet and hired away half of his Lindsley’s staff.
Boyer says the bitterness went both ways. “I do know that both Roger and Beth came to feel badly betrayed by him,” Boyer said of Lindsley. (After a long tenure at the New Yorker and a brief stint at Tina Brown’s Newsweek, Boyer was hired by Ailes at Fox News, and they became colleagues and friends. 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, directed questions to a lawyer for Ailes, Susan Estrich, who did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Lindsley and the book.)
Lindsley, wrote Boyer, was clearly Ailes’ stand-in at the paper: “a smart, combative, burly man with a booming voice,” who “seemed a younger version of Ailes, bringing to the job an intense competitiveness, an aggressive news instinct, and a willingness to provoke.” The article was published in the magazine’s January 31, 2011, issue, and though Lindsley would skip town just 2 1/2 months later, there is no indication in Boyer’s report that anything was amiss.
In reality, Lindsley says he had come to feel increasingly suffocated by Ailes’ paranoia. (“Paranoia was his great comfort,” he says.) Ailes was convinced, for example, that President Obama was working an operative inside Fox News, and he hounded staff members in an effort to out the mole, according to one Fox News executive. “He couldn’t rest easy at all in life. Peace was a phantom. He was always raging,” Lindsley says of Ailes.
Lindsley was unnerved by what he felt was his inability to escape from his boss. “There was no freedom, and I had no time for reflection,” he says. He planned a vacation to his family’s ancestral homestead on Ireland’s Beara Peninsula—and Ailes joined him, tagging along to meet his great-grand-uncle in a 400-year-old cottage. As their relationship soured, he began to notice black Lincoln Navigators following him on the road, driven by men he eventually concluded were News Corporation security officers who had been sent by Ailes.
Initially, Lindsley had been seduced by the proximity to power and by the professional path Ailes laid out for him, which was to culminate in succeeding the Fox News chairman, he believed.
But it was impossible to keep Ailes, and his paranoid worldview, at arm’s length, something Lindsley intimates is as true for Fox viewers as it is for the network’s executives or for anyone who worked as closely with Ailes as he did. “I was involved in every key thing Roger was dealing with,” he says. “I was living in the channel, and I had to decide to change it by getting out of it. I was swept up in the same way the viewers were.”
After leaving Ailes, Lindsley decamped out West, working for the Republican mega-donor Foster Friess and searching for an identity separate from “Ailes Jr.” He goes by J. P. now, not Joe, and he moved to New Orleans in 2014, managing the bluegrass band Scythian before writing his book—which, incongruously, is set in New Orleans.
The book’s manic tone, Lindsley says, is by design. “When people read the story, I want them to feel as paranoid, as crazy, as disturbed as I felt,” he told me. “I want the reader to feel that sort of frenzy and to understand deeply what this world is like, this world that has affected all of us.”
In addition to his personal discomfort with Ailes, Lindsley was also disappointed in the news product. He concluded they were impossible to disentangle—that Ailes’ brutishness and anger weren't affecting only him, but also the news he was putting out in Cold Spring and at Fox and that, by extension, they were corroding the country. “Many Americans invite Bill O’Reilly into their living rooms more often than their neighbors,” he says.
He suggests that the network, with its catchy graphics and busty blondes, seduces viewers and creeps up on them in the same way that Ailes did on him—and to the same effect, producing hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of paranoid, angry, and agitated voters. Though he won’t say it outright, he also suggests the network and its viewers helped to produce the election of Donald Trump. Fox News Channel, he says, is more a brand than a news outlet, and Ailes succeeded in “convincing a large part of the American people"" that Ailes was “on their side.”
Lindsley’s story may be extraordinary, but he believes the lessons he drew from his experience with Ailes are broadly applicable in the Trump era. He wants to explain, he says, “how a young guy got caught up in this and how he got out. And, maybe, how America can get out.”

"Russia is hoping for a “new understanding” and “restored Russian-European relations” according to Kremlin sources, with President Putin said to be “humbled” by the Austrian people voting to back themselves and reject the plan for a New World Order totalitarian world government.
Putin believes that the results of the Austrian election, in particular the victory of theyoungest world leader, 31-year-oldSebastian Kurz, proves the globalists’ destructive agenda is deeply unpopular with real people, and when given a chance they will instinctively reject it out of hand.
“Young people around the world are refusing to accept the noose offered to them by the New World Order. They are refusing to be enslaved,” Putin said, offering his congratulations to Kurz, the youngest world leader.
“The Austrian people stood up against the media, the banks, the establishment, everything was against them, but they said enough. They want change.”
Putin vowed to destroy the New World Order in 2016, and it appears people all over the world have started to wake up and resonate with his goal. The President is “deeply encouraged” that his determination to destroy the invasive organisation’s agenda is gaining momentum, and is shared by people everywhere.
This election result represents the biggest uprising by a European nation, against the elite who run the continent, since Brexit. The New World Order controlled puppets in Brussels are reeling. All of the elite – politicians, bankers, economists, celebrities – told the people to vote for the NWO selected establishment candidates. But the people are waking up. The people said no.
31-year-old Kurz, who has vowed to destroy the New World Order and leave the European Union, wants to slash Austria’s red tape and has repeatedly said during his campaign that the Austrian people are sick of “New World Order globalist policies by EU elites” – which he has promised to end now that he is elected.
The Rothschild NWO cabal will be pacing nervously in their mansions, wondering how to deal with this massive, unexpected blow to their globalist agenda. Their roadmap to arriving at a one world government – so close, yet so far away – has been thrown off course by this uprising of the people.
Neither side of the political establishment wanted Kurz, the world’s youngest leader, anywhere near the presidency of his country. The mainstream media were vilifying him. In short, the sock puppets of the New World Order were united against him. They have a lot to lose if somebody who isn’t playing by their rules takes control – and their nightmare has come true.
Do not be surprised if the mainstream media attempt to convince you of something deeply disturbing in the near future. Never in history has the NWO had such a firm grip on mainstream media operations.
The New World Order controlled elites in Brussels did not expect this blow and they will be a scrambling to take back control.
Triggered by a massive popular uprising, stoked by wholly rational fears, and fired up by hard facts, Austria has regained its status as a powerful, sovereign nation. The people chose to make Austria dignified again, to take control of their economy, their borders, their laws, and make themselves respected in the eyes of the world.
They have taken the bull by the horns and backed themselves as Austrians. They have voted for advance over stagnation. It is the answer for our times.",1
"After treating Bill O’Reilly like a common criminal for unfounded charges that amount to little more than locker room talk, President Trump has decided that Fox News is no longer welcome at the White House. First, he took steps to secure O’Reilly’s future by hiring him as his new media director for the WHOIPand now he’s taking aim at the network that treated him so unfairly.
President Trump also announced that One America News Network would be the new choice for conservatives to get their news and that he was considering buying it to make sure the message it sends is pure and true.
“Fox can no longer be trusted. To give in like that to fake news allegations against a great man like Bill, who has an outstanding record with women, by the way — women love him — to give in is just stupid. They should know better. You guys have a unique opportunity to tell the country what’s really happening. I hope you follow me on Twitter.”
OANN offered O’Reilly a job as well but he turned it down to serve at the pleasure of the president. Fox News said in a statement that they regret the president’s decision but they will honor it.
They said this will in no way turn them against President Trump nor will they join the fake news media in trashing him with lies.
At least someone over there has some integrity.",1
"Doctors are about to treat their 10th Ebola patient on American soil — a Sierra Leonean surgeon with U. S. residency who will be flown to Nebraska on Saturday for treatment, according to a federal official.
Dr. Martin Salia would be the third patient treated at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. A spokesman said in a statement Thursday evening he could not yet confirm anyone was coming. Salia would become the hospital’s third Ebola patient since August.
""However, a patient with the Ebola virus will soon be evaluated for possible treatment of the disease here,"" said Taylor Wilson, senior media relations coordinator for Nebraska Medicine. ""This patient contracted the disease in Sierra Leone and recently tested positive for Ebola. The condition of the patient will dictate whether he comes to Omaha for treatment.
""He will be evaluated by the medical crew on the Phoenix Air jet upon their arrival in Sierra Leone. The members of the crew will determine whether the patient is stable enough for transport - if he is, he would arrive in Omaha sometime Saturday afternoon,"" Wilson said.
Sierra Leone is one of the West African nations grappling with the Ebola outbreak. It's been worsening there, and the country's lost several high-profile doctors to the virus. Salia tested positive Monday.
""Hopefully, by God's grace, everything will come out with a good news,"" Salia's father, Maada Salia, said in a statement.
Nine people have been treated for Ebola in the United States. One of those patients died — Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who contracted the virus in Africa then flew home to Texas for a planned marriage.
Nebraska Medical Center earlier treated Ashoka Mukpo, the cameraman diagnosed with Ebola while working in Liberia as a freelancer for NBC News. On Oct. 21, Mukpo was declared free of the virus and was allowed to leave the facility’s biocontainment unit.
Ebola patient Dr. Richard Sacra also was treated at the Nebraska hospital. He received an experimental drug, as well as blood serum from Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly and was declared virus-free and released Sept. 25.",0
"Online retail giant Amazon is raising eyebrows due to a controversial sweatshirt that makes light of eating disorders.
The black hoodie — sold by third-party vendor RuiLi in size XL for $25.88 — reads in bright pink letters across the chest “Anorexia: Like bulimia, except with self-control.”
The item has a 1.3 star rating with nearly 70 reviews, the majority of which are demanding Amazon to remove the product from its site due to the insensitive nature with which it’s treating eating disorders.
“This sweatshirt is a disgrace. Anorexia is an illness. A very serious illness and people die from it. You need to pull this now from your stock!” one reviewer wrote.
“This is deplorable. Eating disorders are not a joke. How dare you make light of something people struggle with. What you are doing is horrendous,” another reviewer commented.
Claire Mysko, CEO of National Eating Disorders Association said in a statement, “Jokes about eating disorders are dangerous and cliché. This hoodie propagates the myth that eating disorders are trivial and mere issues of willpower or self-control. Stereotypes like this result in increased stigma and are barriers that prevent people from seeking help. Anorexia is not a ‘lifestyle choice,’ it is a mental health disorder with socio-biological influences. We ask that Amazon stand with those affected by these deadly illnesses and remove the sweatshirt from their store.”
The sweatshirt has also been shared on social media, including the body positive Facebook group, Free to Be OK With Me, where people are expressing outrage over the product. Some are even calling for an Amazon boycott.
One user on Twitter pointed out that the sweatshirt has been available to purchase since 2015 despite requests for it to be removed.
However, others argue that whether people agree with what the sweatshirt says or not, Amazon should continue allowing it to be sold because of the right to free speech.
As of Tuesday afternoon, the hoodie was still available for purchase on Amazon.com.

"While the media continues to parrot stories about racism in society and make a big deal about relatively minor incidents and talk about unconscious racism, they ignore or under report true racist incidents. Unfortunately, our biased media only wants to highlight racism when it appears to be perpetrated by a police officer in self-defense against a minority. The media significantly under reports incidents when they do not fit this pre-existing narrative.
Real racism occurs when a group of people viciously beat and harass someone simply because of their race and because they entered the wrong neighborhood. Regardless of what the media says the attacker and victim can be of any race and in all cases it should be condemned. What appears to be a young girl and her brother were taking a short-cut through a public park in Indianapolis. Unfortunately, they did not have the right skin color.
The two were beaten by a gang of thugs caught on a cell phone video. Although the clip went viral on social media, the mainstream media didn’t want it too become the huge national incident earlier cases, such as the Michael Brown incident, and most major news media either completely ignored it or underreported it. If races had been reversed it would have been equally horrible and disgusting. But what would have been different is this would have been on the homepage of CNN for weeks and they would continue to cover it for months. Obama and Eric Holder would have given numerous press conferences. Sharpton would be on the scene. But since the attack doesn’t fit the liberal agenda none of that will happen.
The worst part about the incident was that all of the spectators knew what was coming. They got out their cameras and video recorders, waiting to watch this brutal beat down. These thugs watching and participating in the incident have no regard for decency and showed their racist attitude. Despite the media not covering it, this is what real racism looks like.
If you listen closely to the video that was uploaded on Live Leak, you can hear the crowd screaming for more blood. They waited with anticipation for the fight to begin and cheered on the muggers as they did their dirty deed. The leader of the gang, known as Nook Babilee, took control of the situation and led the group in the fight. The victim’s brother tried to step in and stop the fight but also took significant blows.
Real racism happens when people are targeted specifically for their race and violently attacked for no other reason. Racism does not occur when a cop is doing their job to protect the public or when a well-meaning citizen is defending their own home. The media should remember that next time they parrot a racism story to fit their own preconceived notions of justice.
Also some say showing incidents like this increases racism. Apparently those people feel like these incidents should be swept under the rug. We believe that only showing incidents that fit the media narrative actually increases racism by perpetuating the false narrative that only certain skin colors are capable of racism. Its better to highlight and condemn all such incidents. There are good honest people of all races. There are also, unfortunately, violent and racist individuals of all races.",1

"Who would YOU rather see battling the Media (D) every day?
There’s been some speculation that Spicey might be heading out the door… and some talk that Guilfoyle might be his replacement.
Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former first lady of San Francisco and current Fox News host, is in conversations with the Trump administration about becoming White House press secretary, she said in an interview with the Bay Area News Group on Monday night.
Guilfoyle said the idea of her taking the job or another press role in the White House has been “raised by a number of people” in the Trump administration, although she declined to go into specifics. She noted that she’s regularly in touch with members of the administration in the course of her job.
How does that square with this ClashDaily story:
That is the million dollar question.
The 48-year old Guilfoyle told the Bay Area News Group that it would be an honor to serve her country.
“I’m a patriot, and it would be an honor to serve the country,” Guilfoyle said. “I think it’d be a fascinating job. It’s a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position.”
On her show, The Five, on Fox News last week, Guilfoyle also said:
“If you want to be successful and do communications with President Trump, you have to be someone who he actually wants to spend a little bit of time with,” she said on the air. “You’ve got to insist on getting in front of POTUS, talk to him, and have like five, six minutes with him before you go out there and take the podium, and otherwise you’re driving blind.”
“It has to be somebody with a very close relationship, where there’s trust there, there’s inherent loyalty, someone who’s been there from the beginning,” she added.
She told the Bay Area News Group that she thought she had a good relationship with the Administration.

"Drew Griffin is a correspondent for the investigative unit of CNN/U.S. Based in CNN's world headquarters in Atlanta, Griffin joined the network in May 2004 after working as an investigative reporter for CBS 2 News in Los Angeles for 10 years.
Griffin's wide-ranging expertise includes coverage of politics, as well as sports, corporate, and government investigations.
In 2015, Griffin earned a Peabody Award for his investigation into delays at Veterans Affairs hospitals. Griffin's investigation revealed that at least 19 military veterans had died because of appointment delays, and thousands more were experiencing extremely long waits for treatment. As a result of the coverage, led by Griffin and CNN, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned and other managers were fired. Congress also took action by passing legislation allowing veterans to seek care outside of the VA.
Griffin's other recent investigations have included how gerrymandering and so-called ""Super Pacs"" are impacting the election process, and how some medical residents are cheating on the medical board certification tests for radiologists.
In September 2005, Griffin traveled to New Orleans to cover the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. His reporting about the looting by some New Orleans police officers led to a police force investigation. He also broke stories surrounding nursing home deaths in the wake of Katrina.
Griffin's work as an investigative reporter has taken him across the world enabling him to cover a famine in Somalia, illegal drift net fishermen in Singapore and Los Angeles gang members in El Salvador. He has interviewed U.S. and Russian presidents. Griffin reported from New York City for CBS 2 News after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and from Israel to cover the war on terrorism.
In December 2005, Griffin won a national Emmy Award for business and financial reporting for his reports on a fault in Ford vehicles which allegedly caused them to catch fire. He earned his second national Emmy in 2006 for the CNN Presents documentary ""How to Rob a Bank"" and a third in 2007 for ""Hidden Spending,"" an Anderson Cooper 360° segment about congressional spending. In 2007, the Atlanta Press Club named him Journalist of the Year in the category of national television reporting, and the National Press Foundation gave him its Everett McKinley Dirksen Award for ""Distinguished Coverage of Congress.""
Before joining CNN, Griffin's series of stories on the breakthrough research being performed in reversing Alzheimer's disease, earned him the Associated Press Television-Radio Association Bill Stout Award for Enterprise Reporting. Griffin has also won three Los Angeles Emmys, nine Golden Mikes, an Investigative Reporters and Editor's award for exposing an underground medical network in Los Angeles, a regional Edward R. Murrow Award for exposing fraudulent soliciting at Los Angeles International Airport and numerous other investigative reporting awards from the Associated Press, the L.A. Press Club, and the Radio and Television News Directors Association.
Griffin began his reporting career as a reporter/cameraman for WICD-TV in Champaign, Ill. Since then, Griffin has worked in Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina and Washington. He became an investigative reporter when he joined KIRO-TV in Seattle. He joined CBS 2 News in Los Angeles in January 1994, where he worked as a reporter and anchor and helped create the station's investigative reporting team.
Griffin earned a bachelor's degree in communications from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.",0

Massive UFO Fleet Said Headed Towards Earth
If True Would You Ever Be Told?
At our meeting in Geneva, the U.S. President said that if the earth faced an invasion by extraterrestrials, the United States and the Soviet Union would join forces to repel such an invasion. I shall not dispute the hypothesis, though I think it's early yet to worry about such an intrusion...
Quoted from a speech given by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Gorbachev  on February 17, 1987, in the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow after returning from Geneva where he had met with US President Ronald Reagan.
A lot of buzz is going on over on this side of the pond today over new reports from the MOD (Ministry of Defense for Great Britain) stating that during World War II British Prime Minster Winston Churchill and United States General, and Allied Commander, Dwight Eisenhower [photo top middle] ordered a cover-up of UFOs because of their fears it would cause a mass panic.
Whats most important about this latest revelation relating to UFOs has nothing to do with whether or not they exist, but why for the past nearly 70 years those in power have used everything in their means to not only squash any legitimate investigation into this phenomena, but have also held up for ridicule anyone daring to go against the official lies told to the public?
By the actions of those in power (government, media, banking, corporate) in suppressing the truth of not just UFOs, but also the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Senator Robert Kennedy, the son of President Kennedy John Jr. (who threatened to run against Hillary Clinton in the race for the US Senate), and Civil Rights Champion Martin Luther King, 9/11, and too many other such events to mention, there exists today two completely opposite and diametrically opposed sources for news.
The first is most commonly called The Mainstream Media (MSM) which is comprised of corporate owned media giants who in the United States alone control nearly 90% of the news and information the American public views on television, reads in their newspapers, or sees on the Internet and is called propaganda. Propaganda is a form of communication that is aimed at influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position.
The second source of news is, at best, referred to as alternative news, and at its worst conspiracy theory.  The word conspiracy, in case you didnt know, comes from the two Latin words, con and spirare, meaning to breathe together, which one could successfully argue is what we human beings are supposed to do anyway.
You dont have to be a rocket scientist or math genius to figure out for yourself which of these two sources of news has been winning the battle for the minds of the public over these past nearly 70 years, nor do you have to be a genius to figure out that nearly everything youre told by the MSM is, at its best an outright lie, and at its insidious worst has been deliberately designed to keep you as dumbed down and ignorant as possible.
After all, for your governments, bankers and corporations to throw tens of millions of you out of jobs, and put tens of millions more of you out on the street when they take your homes, while at the same time lavishing upon themselves hundreds of billions of YOUR tax dollars; all occurring with you doing absolutely nothing about it, youve got to admit they are not only winning, you are actually participating in your own destruction.
Now I want to tell you a secret that your propaganda mainstream media will never tell you, and even by us telling you youre programmed not to believe, but is nevertheless true
Human brains are NOT able to process information on any complex subject unless it is received in what is called storytelling. Storytelling is the conveying of events in words, images and sounds often by improvisation or embellishment.
Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture our World has ever known as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and in order to instill moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view.  If any of the essential components of storytelling (plot, character, narrative point of view) are omitted from information your brain receives it literally shuts down.
To fully understand how dangerous it is when your brain shuts down after reading or viewing mainstream media propaganda you should know that even though the human brain comprises only 2% of your body weight, it uses over 20% of your bodys energy.  And if you allow your brain to be shut down, where do you think that extra 20% of your bodys energy supposed to be going to your critical thinking capacity goes?
The answer to that question can be found in any study on obesity.  In the United States alone, obesity is now viewed as an epidemic with rates that have doubled between the years of 1980-2010 from 15% to 30% of its population.  Only one example in human history compares with America today [an orgy loving morally debauched population fed a steady diet of propaganda and amusement], and that is the Roman Empire prior to its destruction.  And if you think the United States can escape what happened to Rome you would be sadly mistaken as history is never wrong, it continually repeats itself.
Now the antidote to the destructive propaganda being fed to you on a near 24-hour basis by your mainstream media masters lies in not what you are toldbut how it is told to you.  And that is why every single report you read that has been written by the Sisters of Sorcha Faal are based on the great Swiss researcher Ferdinand de Saussures systematic structure of languages that serve as a link between thought and sound and Russian biophysicist and molecular biologist Pjotr Garjajevs Linguistic Ordering that proves the esoteric structure of DNA is able to be changed by words and sounds alone.
By ones repeated readings of Sorcha Faal reports your brain and DNA actually begin to reawaken within you thus enabling your mind to see through all types of propaganda and find the Golden Kernel of Truth that lies embedded within the story.  By ones reading and/or viewing of mainstream media propaganda your brain and DNA shut down because our minds are not able to assimilate unconnected facts without their being put into both modern and historical context.
Your breathing together with us enables your mind to be freeYour acceptance of mainstream media propaganda turns you into a mindless slavethis is as simple and as basic as it gets folks.

Nearly everyone has some sort of spot or mole on their body. For some, a speckled face or body is just part of living in their skin, but the spots can also turn into a dangerous cancer called melanoma.
Fortunately, melanoma accounts for relatively few cases of cancer and is highly treatable when caught early. Catching it early is key, though; so you should look into any suspicious moles or spots right away.
According to the American Cancer Society, 87,000 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in 2017 and as many as 9,700 people will die from the cancer. Although melanoma only makes up about1percent of skin cancer cases, it clearly affects many lives and should be taken seriously.
Melanoma is a cancerous growth that occurs because of unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells. Like other cancers, these damaged cells mutate and then grow out of control.
DO YOU HAVE LIVER DAMAGE?
The damage often happens due to ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure or tanning beds. In some cases, though, a person may have an inherited trait or skin disorder that inhibits the body from repairing the damaged skin cells.
Risk factors for melanoma include excessive UV light exposure, moles (especially if there are many), family history, fair skin or a weakened immune system.
Unlike many other cancers, melanoma can often be identified first by the patient and then verified later by a medical professional. To determine whether to get expert advice, you can search for 5 common identifying factors, outlined by the National Cancer Institute as the ABC’s of melanoma.
When judging asymmetry in a mole or spot, imagine that a line is dividing the mole down the middle. If one side of the mole does not match the shape and color of the other side, it may be cancerous. Get expert advice immediately.
A regular freckle or mole on the skin will usually have a defined edge to it. However, melanoma often blurs or fades into the surrounding skin or has jagged edges.
You can often identify melanoma because of its inconsistent color or shade. Again, normal spots will have a consistent color and darkness throughout.
MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS CAUSES BOY TO SLEEP FOR 11 DAYS
For example, the spot may look darker brown in the middle than on the edges. You may also notice white, red or pink spots.
The diameter is the width across the entire mole or spot. Generally, melanoma gets bigger, resulting in a spot larger than the size of a pea. If you notice a mole or spot growing or spreading out on the skin, consult your doctor.
Last, look for changes in the spot over the last few weeks or months. Normal moles or spots won’t change in color, size or shape.
By using these 5 easy criteria, you can judge whether a skin spot needs medical evaluation. While you likely have nothing to worry about, you should check into any suspicious areas as a precaution.
Because melanoma starts out in a localized area, it can easily be treated in its early stages. If you catch it early, you may only need surgery to remove the cancer. After the surgery, you will also need to follow up with your dermatologist on a regular basis.
PAY ATTENTION TO THESE EARLY SIGNS OF OVARIAN CANCER
On the other hand, if the cancer travels deeper within the skin, it may have already spread through the blood vessels and lymphatic system. This later stage of melanoma proves more difficult to treat. You will need to discuss treatment options such as chemotherapy with your doctor based on your specific case.
Doctors have seen a rise in melanoma in the US in the last several decades. While older people have a much higher risk of developing melanoma, more young adults are acquiring the cancer as well.
As with any cancer, the best method for fighting melanoma is prevention. Follow these steps to reduce your risk for this skin cancer:
When going outdoors, use proper protection for your skin, including hats, sunglasses, sunscreen and clothing that covers much of the body.
These artificial sources of UV rays are just as harmful to the skin as UV light from the sun.
Make it a habit to regularly inspect your skin and get familiar with your spots and moles.
Avoid practices that increase your risk for immune-suppressing diseases like HIV. In addition, exercise, get proper rest and eat a well-balanced diet to help your body fend off disease.
Although you likely have a harmless mole or two in some area of your body, you should watch for signs of melanoma. When caught early, melanoma can be easy to treat and overcome. However, the absolute best method of fighting melanoma is through prevention. By maintaining a healthy lifestyle and protecting your skin from the sun, you will dramatically decrease your risk for getting this skin cancer.

Dont Question
Just Obey
Only the educated are free.
Epictetus (55 AD - 135 AD)
The ancient Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus once taught his followers that all suffering arises from trying to control what is uncontrollable, or from neglecting what is within our power. He further stated that as part of the universal city that is the universe, human beings have a duty to care for all their fellow humans. The person who followed these precepts, he said, would achieve happiness.
Epictetus teachings form the basis upon which your world and life are built, but you dont know this fact because the elite factions who rule over you have forbidden your schools to teach you these things, and if youve ever wondered why youre unhappy this is the reason why.
Allow me to explain, but keep in mind that there is NOTHING more important to your life right now than what you are about to readif only you have the courage to do so.
Now the first and most important fact about yourself that youve got to get through that thick head of yours is that you are a Second Class Citizen in the society you live in.  There are no ifs, ands or buts about this FACT and your continued ignorance of it isnt helping you now, has never helped you in the past, and if you dont start wising up is going to destroy you.
The reason youre a Second Class Citizen is because those elites who rule over you are scared to death of what you are capable of doing should you ever discover the truth of what they already know, and what weve been trying to wake you up to for years, and which makes us as dangerous to them as you are.
Now to understand the sheer terror your elite rulers have against you (should you ever decide to wake up that is) youve got to know about the last time people woke up to what was really happening around them, a period now known to history as The Age of Enlightenment
Developing simultaneously in Germany, England, Scotland, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, the movement was buoyed by Atlantic Revolutions, especially the success of the American Revolution in breaking free of the British Empire.
Most of Europe was caught up, including the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Russia, and Scandinavia, along with Latin America and instigating the Haitian Revolution. The authors of the American Declaration of Independence, the United States Bill of Rights, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and the Polish-Lithuanian Constitution of May 3, 1791, were motivated by Enlightenment principles.
And of all of these Age of Enlightenment movements, none evoked more terror in the elite ruling classes than the French Revolution
The French Revolution  was a period of radical social and political upheaval in French and European history. The absolute monarchy that had ruled France for centuries collapsed in three years. (Remember that time frame for those telling you revolutions take a long time to start. They dont.)
French society underwent an epic transformation as feudal, aristocratic, and religious privileges evaporated under a sustained assault from liberal political groups and the masses on the streets. Old ideas about hierarchy and tradition succumbed to new Enlightenment principles of citizenship and inalienable rights.
The French Revolution began in 1789 with the convocation of the Estates-General in May. The first year of the Revolution witnessed members of the Third Estate proclaiming the Tennis Court Oath in June, the assault on the Bastille in July, the passage of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August, and an epic march on Versailles that forced the royal court back to Paris in October.
The next few years were dominated by tensions between a liberal legislature and a conservative monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms. A republic was proclaimed in September 1792 and King Louis XVI was executed the next year. External threats also played a dominant role in the development of the Revolution.
The French Revolutionary Wars started in 1792 and ultimately featured spectacular French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian peninsula, the Low Countries, and most territories west of the Rhineachievements that had defied previous French governments for centuries. Internally, popular sentiments radicalized the Revolution significantly, culminating in the brutal Reign of Terror from 1793 until 1794. After the fall of Robespierre and the Jacobins, the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 and held power until 1799, when it was replaced by the Consulate under Napoleon Bonaparte.
Now if youre thinking that these elite ruling classes, who had been grossly abusing their American and European subjects, were defeated during the Age of Enlightenment you couldnt be more mistaken!  Down? Without a doubt. But defeated? NEVER!  And if there is anything that defines these elite monsters it is their ability to construct a long-range plan and be patient enough to carry it out, and which youre life is living proof of their having succeeded.
And nowhere have they been more successful than in creating a two-tiered educational systemone for the masses designed to keep the knowledge of the ages from being known to the unwashed bottom feeders (thats you), the other one designed for themselves so their children, and their childrens children, would always know the truth and be able to continue ruling over their new subjects.
The American Revolutionary Hero and writer of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, saw what was being planned by these elites and fought for an educational system to be placed under the control of the government, free from religious biases, and available to all people irrespective of their status in society so that the knowledge of the ages would always be available to everyone.  So spectacularly did Jefferson lose, however, that this past week the State of Texas, which controls the content of public school textbooks for nearly all of Americas children, banned him from being taught about in their schools.
Guess what though? At the same time that these elites have created for the unwashed masses a public school system that since the Age of Enlightenment has done more to destroy our collective human knowledge than any other institution (This is called the dropout crisis in the United States which in 2009 alone saw over 6.2 million of their children leave school.), they have created for themselves, all around the Western world, one of the finest educational systems ever knownbut neither you, or your children, will ever have access to it.
One example of this is the Groton School in the United States, which aside from being the alma mater of many of the elites currently ruling America has a yearly tuition charge of nearly $50,000. And what are these elite children being taught for that amount of money that at the same time has been denied to you, and now your children?  Why the knowledge of the ancients!  And in their own words:
Groton encourages the study of Latin and Greek because of the particular benefits they offer in the development of language skills and the perspective they offer into our culture in a broader sense. Beyond language skills themselves, these classical languages offer the best access to the cultures of Greece and Rome. These cultures form the basis of much of our modern thinking.
Go wherever you wish in literature, history, art, architecture, philosophy, government--even math and science--and you will find that the Greeks and Romans have been there before you.
They won't be able to answer your every twenty first-century question, but they will usually have perceived it, and thought about it with genuine perception; and the clarity of their approach, reflected in the kind of language they use, will train you well to pick up on your own thinking where they left off. To a culture like ours, so preoccupied with its own immediate present, these languages open channels not only to the classical world, but to all the interwoven cultural traditions through the two thousand years that separate us.
Put in it most simplistic terms; what you have before you is an elite class of people who control your government, your banks, your corporationseven your schools, who rule nearly every aspect of your lives while at the same time deliberately denying to you, and your children, the KNOWLEDGE and INFORMATION needed to make you as happy as they are. And the saddest part about all of this is that you allowed them to do this!
And guess what? Now that theyve firmly entrenched their two-tiered educational system and have seen that you arent even fighting back against them, what theyve done for schools they are now doing for information.
Thats right, while you have been engaged in a spurious [i.e. plausible but false] debate over if, or if not, the information and knowledge contained on the Internet should, or should not, be free, the elites have been creating (right under your noses mind you) the most powerful information and knowledge bases ever known to modern human beings and which you will NEVER be able to access!
Let me flesh this out for you
First of all, understand that the Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) in other wordsthe computer you are reading this from right now is able to be connected to other computers because all of them are reading the same language.  And thats a good thing because for the first time in modern history people all over the world have the ability to communicate directly with one another, share information and knowledge, and through the collective effort of everyone connected know everything about anything we want to.
And its all FREE!  Or is it?
Well, lets look at how free the Internet really is, or more correctly stated, isnt.
Starting from where you are, right now, youre reading this on a computer that cost you money.  Just having your computer doesnt connect you to anything though; you have to pay to be connected.  Once youre connected to the Internet (your costs so far are nearing $1,000.00 so farcomputer costs, ISP charges for a year, applications, etc.) youre then are able to go to websites to get whatever information youd like to know about.
But the costs dont end there because in order for you to be able to go to those websites the owners of them have had to pay for any number of things, including website development, domain names, ISP hosting charges, bandwidth charges, wages, etc., that can cost anywhere from $25.00 a month for a personal website, to over $1 million for the most visited ones.
And the costs dont end there (especially yours) because in order for your computer to connect to websites you have to have an infrastructure connecting them, which the United States is now saying they need another $350 Billion of their taxpayers money for in order for them to bring their Internet standards up to Romanias!
So as you can see (and if you cant somethings honestly wrong with your thinking), far from being FREE, the Internet has become the most ambitious and expensive undertakings in all of human history whose cost is measured in the TRILLIONS! (The figure is actually so high theyve stopped counting.)
For all of these TRILLIONS spent, and the TRILLIONS more that will be spent, the FREE meme [a cultural item that is transmitted by repetition in a manner analogous to the biological transmission of genes] continues its virus like spread throughout the masses destroying nearly everything in its path, and nowhere is this more evident than in the United States where in the past decade alone an unsuspecting public has laid to waste a once vibrant news and information industry.
From the lowliest small town American newspaper that now outsources its local news overseas, to the flagship New York Times who this week announced it is cutting another 100 newsroom jobs, never before in the history of the United States (or Western society for that matter) have so many momentous events been left unexplained (at best) and ignored (at worst) to a public seeking reason and meaning for a world rapidly descending into chaos and ruin around them.
And as bad as it is right now it is only going to get worse, as at the same time that the Internet has overtaken newspapers for the source Americans (indeed all of the West) most turn to for news and information, the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism is reporting some of the most grim statistics theyve ever seen, and include:
Newspaper ad revenue fell 26 percent last year US newspapers are spending $1.6 billion less annually on reporting and editing than they did a decade ago.
Network television news division resources have been cut by more than half since the late 1980s and ad revenue was down eight percent last year.
Local television newsrooms have shed some six percent of their workforce in the past two years, the report said, and ad revenue was 22 percent lower last year.
Radio ad revenue fell 22 percent in 2009 compared with the previous year and magazine ad revenue was down 17 percent.
And what has been the Americans peoples reaction to the decimation of their news and information industry at what can honestly be said is one of the most crucial times in their history? According to the Pew Research Centers State of the Media report released Monday it is this The good news for traditional US news organizations? Their websites are popular. The bad news? Few news consumers click on ads and hardly any are prepared to pay for news online.
Now I want you to STOP and let the reality of this sink in it has taken less than a generation to re-condition a whole society that news and information is FREE and doesnt have to be paid for. Where your parents, grandparents, every one of your ancestors in fact, since the founding of your Nation, knew the value of news and information and paid for it gladly, you now belong to a society youve helped to create where it is now valueless. (And dont forget thisFREE does equals VALUELESS.)
And if you want to know how truly valueless your free news and information sources have become, just turn on your TV news, pick up any magazine or newspaper, listen to your radio, and then you tell me how much their celebrity driven infotainment is really worth as the world around us continues to spin out of control?
Now I want to tell you a secret that you really need to know right now.What you are doing to yourselves has been deliberately planned to keep you as uninformed and as ignorant as possible, in other words, you are helping your elite classes make you into a Second Class Citizen with news and information as they did to you with education!
And as your access as a Second Class Citizen to honest, timely and reliable news and information is being destroyed by the day because you dont want to pay for it, the elite classes are building up (right under you very nose mind you) their own news and information system that you couldnt even afford to pay for if you wanted to!
Do you want to know the real facts about the Middle East? Then start shelling out $185 a year to the DEBKA file for Israeli intelligence reports.  Do you want to do in-depth research into historical news archives? Then add on another $1,500.00 to subscribe to research giant LexisNexis. Do you want to know about the latest research today thats going to be affecting your world tomorrow? Throw in another $5,000.00 for Project Muse. Do you want to know whats really going on with every countrys military forces?  Then take out a mortgage on your home and subscribe to any number of Janes reports, their weekly intelligence review alone is $1,715.00 and their Defence Budget report is another $8,132.00.
All of these websites Ive just noted are just a drop in the proverbial bucket of the news and information websites on the Internet that have been created for the elite classes to keep them knowledgeable about whats going on in the world, and you will NEVER have access to them because just like theyve done with your education system, theyve priced it out of your reach. Remember, they dont want you to know the truth.
But guess what? We do, and thats why we spend over $88,000.00 a year on subscriptions to these elite websites and then (in our own unique way of course) give this information to you so that instead of being Second Class Citizens you can be (if you choose) First Class ones.
Epictetus was telling one of our human races most common truths when he said Only the educated are free.  And by your not being educated about what is happening in your world you are condemning yourself and everyone around you to slavery. Is that what you really want?
Epictetus also said that human beings have a duty to care for all their fellow humans, and every day when you come to this site our duty to you in keeping you informed meets this highest of standards.
What Im asking of you right now is to do the same, because what we do for you is very expensive and unless we all share this burden none of us will succeed in coming through this darkness into the light of a new tomorrow where peace means more than war, love means more than hate, and where, like the brothers and sisters we truly are, we can once and for all time beat our swords into plowshares and exist with one another in harmony.
But until that day comes, and as the darkness grows ever stronger about us all, I ask you to remember those of us who labor in great danger and distress on your behalf, so that when all is said and done, together we can say we made a difference.

"According to Reuters, Taliban insurgents mounted an attack on a U. S.-operated military base Monday in Khost, an eastern province of Afghanistan. This is on the same day as a surprise visit by U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis.
Reports are alleging that a car bomb was detonated at one of the gates entering the U. S. military base. This has been confirmed by U.S. military spokesman in Afghanistan, Capt. William Slavin. According to Slavin, there were not any U.S. military or coalition casualties.
It has been a deadly month, following a Taliban attack on an Afghan soldier base in which 170 Afghan casualties were reported.

"There are several different phases to launching an online business. The first is coming up with a good idea. This will include deciding which type of products or services you will sell. The next step is to design a site that will be attractive to potential customers. Your site must effectively describe the items you are selling in a manner that will convince people to buy them. However, it is the third phase that many new online business owners tend to overlook. This phase involves properly promoting your online business to the general public. Needless to say, your business will not succeed if nobody knows about it. Here are several of the best methods for promoting an online business you have recently launched.
Creating a blog about the products or services you sell could attract people who are interested in those particular things.
Blogs can be found these days on any topic imaginable. Blogs can be a useful tool that can assist you in promoting your online business. You can write blogs that relate to the products and services that you sell on your site. You can post various videos on your blog that go into greater detail about these items. You can then provide a link for your online business site that people can click on if they are interested in buying any of the items you are blogging about. You might also want to consider contacting the owners of blogs that are already very popular. You can offer to write blogs that will hopefully get the attention of the visitors to that particular site.
It is essential that you make good use of social media when you are getting your online business up and running. Failure to do so will mean that you are cheating yourself out of many potential customers. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter will allow you to promote your new site as often as you want. You will even be able to contact a wide variety of people who do not live in your country. These sites are used around the world. This is an important fact that you must keep in mind as you try to grow your brand internationally. Installing live chat services on your site will allow you to communicate more easily with your customers.
Send emails to potential customers who fit into your target demographic.
Email is basically as old as the Internet. However, the fact that email has been around for a long time does not mean that it is obsolete. On the contrary, it is still used around the world every day by millions of people. Therefore, you should consider acquiring a list of addresses that you can use to launch an email marketing campaign for your site. This type of campaign can be quite effective. You should also hire someone who has designed email marketing campaigns in the past.",1
"The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home.
“I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.
Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.”
But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued.
“So, that’s why I find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that I’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” Bannon added. “Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.”
“And when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, I don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘I do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?” he concluded.",1
"Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich went off on CNN and the rest of the liberal media and people are already calling it the Thursday morning massacre.
Gingrich ripped into the anti-Trump media on Tuesday, saying that he’s personally “‘offended by the American news media” and believes President Donald Trump should “close down the White House press briefing room.”
BOOM. But he was just getting started.
He continued dropping truth bombs telling the Daily Mail that reporters should be banished to a Starbucks so they could write their lies in humiliation and Sean Spicer should take questions via skype or facetime from average Americans.
You know, the people who elected Trump. No one in the liberal media voted for Trump.
But then Newt got serious and this is important. Newt was deservedly angry with how the media covered the leaking of so-called classified information about ISIS to the Russians.
Trump can declassify anything he wants to at any time he wants to but that is not the point. The point is in the rush to bash Trump the media is the one that made the info public so even ISIS knows.
The liberal media assumed the Russians would tell ISIS (not sure why they hate ISIS too) so they could go after Trump and in their rush to judge they ended up being the ones to alert ISIS.
A furious Newt, speaking from Europe told politico what he reallythinks of the media:
“I am personally offended by the American news media. I think it is destructive and disgusting. It is a danger to the country right now, the damage the news media is doing to the United States is despicable.”",1
"North Korea just did exactly what everyone was worried they would do. On their biggest holiday, the Day of the Sun, Kim Jong Un launched a missile.
The ICBM is thought to have been one of his new, nuclear ready missiles that he called a “game changer.” To make it worse, Mike Pence was flying in a jeton his way to South Korea right then!
However, when everything seemed at its darkest, a miracle happened…
That’s right! Thank God the North Koreans still only build mediocre weapons. Their missile didn’t even take off!
However, what they did prove by trying to fire it was that we are past the point of reason. The Kim family needs to be dealt with right now.
The news of their failure was released by the South Korean Defense Ministry, which said,
‘North Korea attempted to test an unidentified type of missile from Sinpo area in the South Hamkyong Province this morning, but we suspect the launch has failed.’
I just wanna take a second and say Thank You to God for keeping VP Pence safe.
Now that that’s out of the way, I think it’s time for Trump and Mattis to do whatever they think is best and deal with this once and for all. Send your Prayers!",1
"Tucker Carlson's television career has crashed and burned all Halloween orange so many times in the past decade—The Spin Room; Crossfire; Tucker Carlson: Unfiltered; Tucker—and on so many networks—CNN, PBS, MSNBC—that it’s a wonder that the Fox News Channel has given him another shot with another nighttime show, Tucker Carlson Tonight.
And what a shot it is. The network recently moved Carlson from the 7 p.m. slot to the cushiest position in all of prime-time cable news—9 p.m.—following and preceding ratings-leaders Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity. Carlson’s ratings are up compared to the program his replaced, Megyn Kelly’s The Kelly File, which we can attribute to his perseverance and the audience-growth hormone drug that is Trumpmania. Like all of the prime-time Fox hosts, Carlson has drunk deeply from the Trump flask. He may not be completely in the tank for Trump, but the administration could run for a few weeks on the fumes Carlson huffs.
Carlson, who was previously the bow-tie wearing butt of Jon Stewart's 2004 barbs, has swapped spaces with his tormenter. Today, Stewart is that vaguely familiar bearded fellow who occasionally pops up on the tube, and Carlson is cable TV’s new prince.
The Carlson show, like most Fox nighttime fare, steers by the O’Reilly and Hannity compass, making him a ‘lil brother of the big boys. Tucker O’Hannity, if you will. Fox bookers recruit guests according to the day’s headlines, bringing in both conservatives who buy the Fox agenda as well as liberals, lefties and febrile loons willing to play the palooka for a couple of short rounds. Carlson, skilled at corroding a guest’s argument with sarcasm, rarely sprays them with the sort of vitriol Bill and Sean naturally secrete. His youthful, friendly countenance—I can attest from meeting him several times and attending a book party at his home—is genuine. But like any cable news guy, he’s a mortician: The other guy’s dying is his living. The best TV culminates not in gentle Charlie Rose patter but a well-placed kill shot.
Still, Carlson is not invincible. As illustrated previously in this series, gunslingers like O’Reilly and the late Tim Russert can be beat, so why not Carlson? If that’s your goal (only a dope goes on TV to lose), please do your homework! The Fox shows scour the past, looking for embarrassing info on their guests. You know your vulnerabilities better than Carlson—so have a killer return ready for his best serve. This seems obvious, but many guests invite blindsiding. If you’ve written or said it, it’s likely that that by show time Carlson will know it.
Everybody knows to avoid beaming in, split-screened, to interrogatory programs like Carlson’s. Split-screened, you’re isolated in a remote studio talking into a big camera. When the host barks questions in your earpiece, you can’t help but jolt to life like a puppet on a string. On set with the host, the dynamic changes. You become more of his equal, a co-creator of the conversational rhythm instead of a mere follower.
If at all possible, do your best to be a current or past government official of high standing. Carlson, like O’Reilly, respects authority and isn’t comfortable with ripping high-status guests. Robert Gates, former CIA director and secretary of defense, took a cakewalk through the show recently in an interview that couldn't have been more deferential had Carlson been applying for a job. “Who was the best defense secretary since the Second World War?” Carlson brown-nosed. Lefty professor of Russian studies Stephen F. Cohen, who in a previous Fox era would be considered prey, gets friendly and repeated roll-outs by Carlson, perhaps for supporting Trump-style détente with Vladimir Putin.
Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich got the soft gloves recently, too, but for a different reason: Carlson’s aim was to out Reich as a Trumpite. “The smart people [in] the [Democratic] party like you, who have had a consistent populist economic message for all these years, also aren’t giving [Trump] a chance,” Carlson said. “He’s closer to you on some key issues—not peripheral stuff—like trade, than Hillary Clinton.” The comparison flummoxed Reich, who accepted it and appeared to be appalled by it. It was a boxing match, but the kind in which neither combatant suffers a nick. Similarly, Carlson drafted rabble-rouser Glenn Greenwald to testify about how the “deep state” citizens of the CIA and elsewhere have leaked to damage the Trump administration. It was a gentlemanly, if toothless, talk. New York Times columnist Tom Friedman got the same treatment when he appeared to plug his new book. See also, James Woolsey, who got an easy ride, as well as Lindsey Graham, whom Carlson tweaked but never tortured. Does Carlson defer out of respect or because their appearances convey status on the show and he seeks their return engagements?
My advice won’t work if you take your most untenable positions onto Tucker Carlson Tonight. Like other Fox hosts, he books obscure liberals and lefties onto his card to lose, and rare is the episode that doesn’t include at least one patsy. University of Connecticut professor of sociology Matthew Hughey stepped into Carlson’s electronic stump grinder recently to defend his thesis that Trump and Trump supporters are heteronormative, white male supremacists, a position for which there isn’t a fraction of a constituency among Fox viewers. Alex Mohajer, a Huffington Post contributor, wrote that Clinton is the rightfully elected president of the United States. For his pains, he got a Carlson dunking.
Carlson telegraphs an intent to butcher a patsy by letting his face go reptilian still, which makes him look both Botoxed and as if he’s caught Bell’s palsy. Next, Carlson’s right hand comes up—always his right hand—to karate-chop the air at chest level as he interrupts and reinterrupts his guest and disputes everything said. “Your facts are actually wrong, no-no,” Carlson said to Hughey, giving him the Tucker salute. If being cut short rattles you, get over it or don’t go on the show. Think in sentences, not in paragraphs. Work on your cardio-vascular stamina.
When Carlson catches a guest in his pincers, he squeezes ever harder if the guest tries to wriggle out. When refugee advocate Kevin Appleby made a moral argument for admitting additional immigrants in a recent appearance, saying it would make the United States safer, Carlson sprung what looked like a pre-scripted comeback. “Look, you’re basically saying we have to let more people in or else we’ll be hated more by Islamic extremists,” Carlson said. Seeing as they already hate us, he held, why bother? Always resist the temptation to duck or finesse a direct Carlson question, because he’s a very good listener. Stand up for what you believe without sounding stupid, and you might fight him to a draw. But duck a question, and you’re dead. Tattooed on Carlson’s corneas is the statement “Answer the question!”—which he’ll play at high volume in an endless loop until you break. Appleby got the “question” barrage, as did Obamacare co-architect Jonathan Gruber and Jehmu Greene, a candidate for DNC chair, and you’ll get it, too, if you try to slip his grasp.
Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald got the “Answer the question!” treatment in a December appearance. He tried to slay Carlson with preambles, posturing and a prop—a large binder labeled “Tucker Carlson Falsehoods” that he displayed for the camera when Carlson got under his collar. The bickering went on for nine minutes as Carlson submerged Eichenwald with an unending wave of “Answer the questions” over an ill-advised tweet the writer had published, then deleted, about Trump’s mental health history. Neither journalist came off well, but the day went to Carlson, who never let up from his opening attack of, “Do you believe that you are practicing journalism?” You can’t beat Carlson if you’ve decided to beat yourself.
The best-prepared guest to debate Carlson must be Teen Vogue contributor Lauren Duca. She fought him to a draw—many would say to a win—on the topic of Ivanka Trump’s feminism. Duca wasn’t just prepared—she also sounded like an experienced debater. At some points Duca sounded positively Tuckerian, a strategy I would never counsel, blasting him with, “I think your earpiece might not be working, because that is certainly not what I said” when he tried to put words in her mouth. “You’re actually being a partisan hack who is attacking me ad nauseam and not even allowing me to speak,” she accurately said. When Carlson gets mad or rattled on air—and that’s rare—he laughs semi-hysterically, which he did when it became clear Duca could not be cross-talked into silence. Duca fought with hot breath, which ordinarily triggers Carlson for the kill. But this time it worked, forcing Carlson to conclude with a final riff that was beneath him. “All right, I gotta go. You should stick to the thigh-high boots. You’re better at that.”
Another guest who dueled with Carlson and won was BuzzFeed News Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith, who bravely sallied forth to discuss his site’s decision to publish the “dossier” on Trump's Russian visits. Smith was too grooved on the topic for Carlson to dislodge him, so Carlson switched to a strafing maneuver, claiming that “BuzzFeed News has a pretty open political agenda—masquerading as journalism.” Smith deftly blocked him—“Is it open or is it masquerading?” Carlson’s point was BuzzFeed is too LGBTQ-friendly to be considered a legitimate news organization. Really? Whatever you may think of BuzzFeed’s predilections, the site is nowhere near as partial as the conservative-tilting, Trump-thumping Fox. Instead of resisting Carlson, Smith wore the insult like a garland, confessing that the news site is pro-gay but adding that it covered the gay-marriage story aggressively and accurately, something Carlson couldn’t dispute.
When Carlson tried again, describing BuzzFeed’s affirmative action recruitment for minority fellows as “the textbook definition of racism,” Smith noted that affirmative action programs exist almost everywhere in corporate life, again checkmating his opponent. Carlson finally fired his magic bullet, “You're better than this. Just give me a straight answer.” Smith held his ground, kept cool as Carlson got hot and answered the questions with the sort of TV brevity and confidence that makes you think somebody should hire him to do a show. I doubt that any host could have gotten the better of Smith that night. Carlson ended the interview with a promise to resolve the dispute over a future lunch, all but conceding the match.
If my cheat sheet doesn’t fill you with optimism about beating Carlson when he finally invites you on his show, I understand. In the theater of cable news, somebody must suffer before the hour is over. Like O’Reilly, Carlson prepares for his guests but struggles when they surprise him by matching him for wit and interruption. The best advice for beating Tucker Carlson is this: Be unflappable. Be affable. Be Tucker Carlson.

"BP is buying back shares the company issued to cover its dividend payout amid the oil price crash. The news was widely seen as a clear indication that one of the world’s supermajors has successfully adjusted to the new price normal and is now settling in the business-as-usual rut once again.
Yet this is a new rut of strict cost controls, continuous efforts to keep lowering production costs, and working to mend the reputation stain left by the 2011 Deepwater Horizon disaster.
The combination of these factors, along with higher oil prices, of course, helped the company boost its third-quarter net profit substantially, and according to BP executives, the road ahead is clear and the direction is back to growth, with breakeven at $49 a barrel.
The breakeven price has become a metric that oil investors and analysts are watching like hawks. It didn’t matter when Brent sold for over $120 a barrel, but now that the profit margins have been squeezed so tightly, breakeven has come to the fore and BP is just one of many oil majors striving to bring it down as low as it can go.
The share buyback news pulled BP’s shares higher and with a good reason. The UK-based major became the first among its peers to start buying back shares as it feels confident enough with the current cash flows. This confidence means BP has enough cash on hand to fund dividend payments in full. Investors and analysts have traditionally watched the cash metric closely, as it caused much worry during the price downturn.

More: Recovery? The oil and gas industry is hiring again
More: Can $60 oil last? Depends on U. S. shale producers' actions
The obvious question: How sustainable is this sentiment? The answer is complex and involves factors such as technological progress, climate change measures, and global oil fundamentals — but one thing seems certain: The sustainable improvement in BP’s and other supermajors’ results will, to a large extent, hinge on refining operations.
BP’s third-quarter performance — a more than doubling of net profits to $1.9 billion— came largely on the back of an increase in downstream profits, which hit US$2.3 billion. To compare, upstream profits came in at $1.6 billion.
Downstream operations have helped all the supermajors survive the price collapse, and it seems they will continue to provide strong support to the bottom line. Recently, Wood Mackenzie forecast that rising demand for petrochemicals will save integrated oil companies from a slump in financial performance, becoming the main driver for oil demand, to replace fuels.
Another recent paper reinforces this expectation. A report from Carbon Tracker suggests a quarter of refining capacity in the world will go under by 2035 if all the governments that have undertaken initiatives to slow down the rate of global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by that year stick to their promises.
Those who have complex refining operations, Carbon Trackers said, will survive thanks to the variety of products they market. Refiners of a simpler nature will be squeezed out of the market by consistently lower margins resulting from lower oil demand. That’s good news for the supermajors with their complex refining operations, and BP’s latest figures are just one more piece of evidence that they’re on the right track with cutting costs across operations and finding ways to strengthen refining margins further through efficiency boosts and new products.

"This shouldn’t come as a surprise to many, but it should serve as a warning: we have no idea how much information is already being censored from us – but, with such things in existence (at least in the UK and US) as the lovingly called “Internet Kill Switch”, we need to be aware.
Natural News today published an article called, “Online news sites to be blacked out during next major catastrophic event?” [1] has some rather disturbing information today.
According to what I’m hearing from several sources in my network of contacts, the U. S. government is putting systems in place to black out online news sites like Natural News, Drudge Report, The Blaze and many others. A practice run that took place earlier this week in California has already achieved this result and confirmed the technical ability to make it happen at will.
The recent outage of news sites experienced by internet users in California was reported by this article on BeforeItsNews.com and confirmed by The Washington Times, The Blaze and other sites. The Natural News reader service team also recorded numerous complaints from California users who were unable to reach our website even though our site was fully functional and serving pages worldwide.
What was especially telling about this outage is that it only affected online news sites while allowing other internet traffic to flow normally. This selective targeting of news websites could have been accomplished by “deep packet inspection used inside the routers that move information packets along the internet,” reported Before Its News technical staff. “This technology allows ISP’s to look inside the packets your computer sends and receives and then make a decision to allow the packets through, modify the packets or block them. This technique can also be used to slow or speed up traffic.”
The selective targeting proves that this was not a general outage. The traffic blockage was specifically targeted to online news sites.
This selective blocking that took place earlier this week is widely believed to have been a dry run for a planned online news site blockade by the federal government during an upcoming “major event.”
What sort of major event? The sort of major event where the government wants its official narrative to be the only information allowed to circulate, obviously. These tend to be either terrorism events or false flag events which are seized upon by the government to enact harsh new police state regulations and surveillance initiatives to spy on the American people. Similar events in recent U. S. history include Oklahoma City, Waco and of course 9/11 — all of which were exploited to vastly expand police militarization and the surveillance reach of the federal government. (Patriot Act, anyone?)
What all governments know is the importance of “getting out in front of the narrative” and telling the government’s story first, before anyone else can look at the facts and present a more rational explanation for what happened.
The infamous hacker Guccifer, now arrested, is well known for hacking into the email accounts of members of the Bush family in the United States. According to numerous stories in the mainstream media, Guccifer acquired emails which spoke of a nuclear detonation in a major city in Pennsylvania in 2015.
A widely-cited story published in the New York times just two weeks ago revealed that Guccifer obtained information that he believed indicated a nuclear bomb would be detonated in Chicago and / or Pennsylvania in 2015. As the New York Times explains it, these are “wild conspiracy theories,” but the psychologist who interviewed Guccifer insisted the man wasn’t crazy at all.
The English-speaking prison psychologist, who attended my meeting with the hacker, rolled his eyes as Mr. Lazar started reading his explanatory text in good but heavily accented English. It was a compendium of wild conspiracy theories involving so-called Illuminati, a secret cabal that he believes runs the world. Most of the conspiracies were old hat, like ones relating to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, by Al Qaeda. But others, such as an alleged plan to set off a nuclear bomb in Chicago and an unnamed city in Pennsylvania next year, were clearly his own work.
The psychologist said he had heard them all before but nonetheless had no doubt about the state of Mr. Lazar’s mental health. “He is not really crazy at all…”
It is widely speculated across the ‘net that Guccifer stumbled across emails of high-level operatives who were discussing plans for nuking American cities. Speculation, of course, is not the same as proof, and it is entirely possibly this may be nothing more than Guccifer’s attempts to attract attention.
Regardless, there is no question whatsoever that the U. S. federal government has been accelerating its readiness for something big. During the recent Ebola scare (the first wave, because there’s still more to come…), it was widely reported that the U.S. State Department put out a bid for 160,000 hazmat suits. Are these for Ebola? Or something else entirely?
Theories of what might be coming our way in 2015 tend to focus on the following speculative possibilities, ranging from “nearly certain” to “way out there:”
 Global financial collapse, where the 2008 bankster bailouts have finally come back to haunt us again in 2015, causing a cascading collapse of global derivatives debt and the fragile banking industry. This would obviously be followed almost immediately by mass social chaos, riots, revolutions and so on.
 Nuclear attack by Russia, in the aftermath of the current petrodollar disaster where Russia is getting economically crushed by plummeting oil prices. See this excellent article by Mac Slavo for a full explanation of the dynamics.
 Nuclear terrorism in America, carried out by whatever radicals with foreign-sounding names the mainstream media wants you to hate at the moment.
 False flag terrorism deliberately carried out on American soil for political purposes (usually to blame some convenient political group such as the Tea Party).
Of these, I personally think financial problems are the most likely. There are already recent signs in the stock market that something has gone terribly awry and a severe market correction is long overdue. The U. S. Treasury’s recent creation of $1 trillion in new debt just to pay off old debt is downright shocking. Anyone who understands the power of compounding interest will immediately realize that the U.S. is plummeting toward certain financial insolvency.
I recommend this really good article on ZeroHedge.com which explains what’s really happening with the debt situation:
“You have to think about a huge tower of debt on shaky foundations where central banks pump concrete in the foundations in an emergency effort to avoid the building from collapsing and at the same time builders are adding additional floors on top…
We all are in a Ponzi world right now. Hoping to be bailed out by the next person. The problem is that demographics alone have to tell us, that there are fewer people entering the scheme then leaving. More people get out than in. Which means, by definition, that the scheme is at an end. The Minsky moment is the crash. Like all crashes it is easier to explain it afterwards than to time it before. But I think it is obvious that the endgame is near.",1
"Sean Hannity went head-to-head with Fox News this week, after citing some election polls that were deemed “unscientific” by the network.
According to reports, Hannity cited a series of online polls claiming that Donald Trump was the winner of the first presidential debate. Dana Blanton, vice president of public-opinion research at Fox News, sent out a memo to network producers that unscientific and “do not meet our editorial standards.”
Hannity clearly ignored that menu. That was until Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple claimed Hannity was “100% beyond the reach of Fox News management.”
“I wouldn’t be surprised to find that in its next annual report, 21st Century Fox will report that the ‘Hannity’ show at some point in the 2106 cycle was spun off as an independent company separate from Fox News,” Wemple commented. “He’s running his own fiefdom, his own shop, his own news network.”
But Hannity was still citing the controversial resource as late as Thursday.
“I know that people hate when I cite online polling,” Hannity explained on the show that night. “But when you see The Hill and you see Slate and Time.com, these are not mainstream conservative polling or websites. And when they vote after a debate so overwhelmingly for Trump, it’s telling me something.”
“I imagine that he is wanting to be helpful to Donald Trump as an extension of the campaign,” one Fox News host told reporters. “But if Hillary Clinton had won any of those online polls, he probably would not have touted them.”
What do you think? Are you tired of seeing Hannity criticized for being a Trump supporter?",1
"Russian Foreign Ministry Official Maria Zakharova tore into a CNN international correspondent, telling him to “stop spreading lies and false news” as he hounded her about the latest conspiracy theories regarding Russian ties to the Trump administration.
Chance appeared on CNN to recount his encounter with Zakharova.
“She, and other Russian officials, are not happy at all with the way this political situation is developing in the United States,” he reported. “‘Toxic hysteria’ is what they are calling it – the idea that Russia intervened in some way in the U. S. elections. They’re rejecting that, of course.”
“Specifically, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, pushed back strongly on the idea that the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, was in any way related to espionage,” he went on, as CNN cut to footage from the brief, but tense interview.
“Mr. Kislyak is a well-known, world class diplomat, who was a deputy minister of foreign affairs in Russia,” explained Zakharova. “He has communicated with his American colleagues for decades in different fields, and CNN accused him of being a Russian spy, or recruiting spies? My god – stop spreading lies and false news.”
“This is good advice for CNN: Please stop spreading lies and false news,”she indignantly chided Chance before walking away.
Returning to Chance on the live broadcast, he and his hosts all continued to whip the spin machine, implying that it’s suspicious that both the Russian authorities and the Trump administration call CNN ‘liars’ and ‘fake news.’
“Right, ‘stop spreading lies and fake news,’ it’s a refrain that we’ve heard elsewhere, and we’re hearing it now repeatedly, from Russian officials, as well,” concluded Chance.
He reinforced his insinuations via Tweet –
Chance’s opportunity to question Zakharova came immediately after she delivered a weekly briefing in Moscow during which she unabashedly ripped the American mainstream media for lying to the public.
“I have a question: is it rock bottom, which the US media has reached, or is there an even greater depth for them to dive?” Zakharova asked. “[The mainstream media] cross the line far beyond the professional ethics and their competence. They accuse and judge by simply fabricating false information.”
“The things that the US media affords itself to report are just an attempt at… a total disinformation of the public in America and worldwide,” she added.
Both President Trump and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have called the baseless frenzy a “witch hunt,” which will likely fuel the inferno being kept alight by the fifth column fourth estate and what remains of their credulous audience.",1
"The founder and former CEO of Fox News died suddenly — less than a year after accusations of sexual assault forced him to resign.
Roger Ailes had just turned 77 on Monday.
He died alone in his Garrison, New York home.
His wife was in Palm Beach, Florida at the time of his death.
His wife Elizabeth, with whom he has one 16-year-old son, released the following statement to Matt Drudge:
‘I am profoundly sad and heartbroken to report that my husband, Roger Ailes, passed away this morning. Roger was a loving husband to me, to his son Zachary, and a loyal friend to many.
‘He was also a patriot, profoundly grateful to live in a country that gave him so much opportunity to work hard, to rise—and to give back.
‘During a career that stretched over more than five decades, his work in entertainment, in politics, and in news affected the lives of many millions.
‘And so even as we mourn his death, we celebrate his life,’ the statement reads.
Ailes had hemophilia, multiple surgeries on his joints, prostate surgery, and was overweight.
When he was 72, Ailes said that he didn’t expect to live much longer.
In an excerpt from the 2013 biography Roger Ailes Off Camera, Ailes said he knew he didn’t have long left to live.
‘My doctor told me that I’m old, fat, and ugly, but none of those things is going to kill me immediately,’ he told the author, Zev Chafets, shortly before his 72nd birthday. ‘The actuaries say I have six to eight years. The best tables give me 10. Three thousand days, more or less.’
He added: ‘I’d give anything for another 10 years.’
Ailes was accused of sexual assault and fostering a misogynistic work environment.
Fox News owner, Rupert Murdoch, had wanted to keep Ailes, but his sons, James and Lachlan wanted him gone.
In a letter to Murdoch released at the time, Ailes said: ‘I will not allow my presence to become a distraction from the work that must be done every day to ensure that Fox News and Fox Business continue to lead our industry.’

"Sky has threatened to shut down Sky News if the news channel proves to be an obstacle in Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox bid.
Regulators are investigating the deal amid concerns that Mr Murdoch's media empire could become too powerful.
Sky told the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) that the regulator should not assume ""the continued provision"" of Sky News.
BBC media editor Amol Rajan said it was a ""credible threat"".
Fox owns 39% of Sky but wants full control of the satellite broadcaster.
In a submission made to the CMA last month, but published by the regulator on Tuesday, Sky said it ""would likely be prompted to review"" its position if ""the continued provision of Sky News in its current form unduly impeded merger and/or other corporate opportunities available in relation to Sky's broader business"".
This would particularly be the case if shareholders objected to the merger not happening, Sky said.
Closing Sky News would only be an option of last resort, and the broadcaster would try to find a buyer for the media company before that eventuality, the BBC understands.
""The messaging coming through is alarming for supporters of Sky News but it runs completely counter to all the investment that there has been in the channel in all the recent months and years,"" said Joey Jones, a political correspondent at Sky News for 16 years and now head of public affairs at PR firm Weber Shandwick.
But he said the threat was a risky move by Sky: ""Inevitably this will be perceived by those who are already hostile to the proposed takeover, particularly in the political arena, as sabre rattling and as a perceived threat by the company"".
Media editor Mr Rajan said that Sky News lost ""an awful lot of money"".
""It loses tens of millions of pounds, and I think the independent directors of Sky are sending a very clear message... that if they had to choose, maybe they'd prefer for commercial reasons to do the deal with 21st Century Fox rather than continue to fund the losses at Sky News.""
What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal?
The submission comes a day after reports that Fox has discussed selling ""most"" of its business, including its Sky stake, to Disney.
Fox has faced a number of hurdles in its bid to buy Sky, including the CMA investigation and opposition from some politicians.
Some fear the deal would give Rupert Murdoch's family too much control over the UK media.
The Murdoch family owns controlling stakes in both News Corporation, which owns UK newspapers such as the Sun and the Times, as well as Fox, which operates in film and TV.",0
"(Before It's News)University of Washington researchers have demonstrated for the first time that devices that run on almost zero power can transmit data across distances of up to 2.8 kilometers — breaking a long-held barrier and potentially enabling a vast array of interconnected devices.
For example, flexible electronics — from knee patches that capture range of motion in arthritic patients to patches that use sweat to detect fatigue in athletes or soldiers — hold great promise for collecting medically relevant data.
But today’s flexible electronics and other sensors that can’t employ bulky batteries and need to operate with very low power typically can’t communicate with other devices more than a few feet or meters away. This limits their practical use in applications ranging from medical monitoring and home sensing to smart cities and precision agriculture.
By contrast, the UW’s long-range backscatter system, which uses reflected radio signals to transmit data at extremely low power and low cost, achieved reliable coverage throughout 4800-square-foot house, an office area covering 41 rooms and a one-acre vegetable farm. The system is detailed in a paper to be presented Sept. 13 at UbiComp 2017.
The research team built this flexible epidermal patch prototype — which could be used to collect and wirelessly transmit useful medical data — that successfully transmitted information across a 3,300 square-foot atrium.

“Until now, devices that can communicate over long distances have consumed a lot of power. The tradeoff in a low-power device that consumes microwatts of power is that its communication range is short,” said Shyam Gollakota, lead faculty and associate professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. “Now we’ve shown that we can offer both, which will be pretty game-changing for a lot of different industries and applications.”
The team’s latest long-range backscatter system provides reliable long-range communication with sensors that consume 1000 times less power than existing technologies capable of transmitting data over similar distances. It’s an important and necessary breakthrough toward embedding connectivity into billions of everyday objects.
The long-range backscatter system will be commercialized by Jeeva Wireless, a spin-out company founded by the UW team of computer scientists and electrical engineers, which expects to begin selling it within six months.
The communication range of many low-power devices is limited to several feet. The UW’s long-range backscatter system’s sensor (shown in the foreground) was able to communicate with a receiver (held in the distant background) throughout a one-acre farm, a 4,800-square-foot house and an office area covering 41 rooms.
The sensors are so cheap — with an expected bulk cost of 10 to 20 cents each — that farmers looking to measure soil temperature or moisture could affordably blanket an entire field to determine how to efficiently plant seeds or water. Other potential applications range from sensor arrays that could monitor pollution, noise or traffic in “smart” cities or medical devices that could wirelessly transmit information about a heart patient’s condition around the clock.
“People have been talking about embedding connectivity into everyday objects such as laundry detergent, paper towels and coffee cups for years, but the problem is the cost and power consumption to achieve this,” said Vamsi Talla, CTO of Jeeva Wireless, who was an Allen School postdoctoral researcher and received a doctorate in electrical engineering from the UW. “This is the first wireless system that can inject connectivity into any device with very minimal cost.”
The research team, for instance, built a contact lens prototype and a flexible epidermal patch that attaches to human skin, which successfully used long-range backscatter to transmit information across a 3300-square-foot atrium. That’s orders of magnitude larger than the 3-foot range achieved by prior smart contact lens designs.

The system has three components: a source that emits a radio signal, sensors that encode information in reflections of that signal and an inexpensive off-the-shelf receiver that decodes the information. When the sensor is placed between the source and receiver, the system can transmit data at distances up to 475 meters. When the sensor is placed next to the signal source, the receiver can decode information from as far as 2.8 kilometers away.
The advantage to using reflected, or “backscattered,” radio signals to convey information is a sensor can run on extremely low power that can be provided by thin cheap flexible printed batteries or can be harvested from ambient sources — eliminating the need for bulky batteries. The disadvantage is that it’s difficult for a receiver to distinguish these extremely weak reflections from the original signal and other noise
The UW team also transmitted information across a 3,300 square foot atrium using this “smart” contact lens prototype.

“It’s like trying to listen to a conversation happening on the other side of a thick wall — you might hear some faint voices but you can’t quite make out the words,” said Mehrdad Hessar, an Allen School doctoral student. “With our new technology we can essentially decode those words even when the conversation itself is hard to hear.”
To overcome the problem, the UW team introduced a new type of modulation — called chirp spread spectrum — into its backscatter design. Spreading the reflected signals across multiple frequencies allowed the team to achieve much greater sensitivities and decode backscattered signals across greater distances even when it’s below the noise.

“We basically started with a clean slate and said if what we really need to enable smart applications is long-range communication, how could we design the system from the ground up to achieve that goal?” said Bryce Kellogg, a co-founder at Jeeva Wireless who was a UW electrical engineering student.
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation.
Co-authors include Joshua Smith, professor in the Allen School and the UW Department of Electrical Engineering, and UW electrical engineering doctoral student Ali Najafi.",1
"Have a good way out.
Hip-hop icon Snoop Dogg says he is moving to Canada.
Cordozar Calvin Broadus, Jr., better known by his rap moniker Snoop Dogg, took to Instagram to announce that he will be moving to Toronto. He even reached out to Toronto native Drake for help finding a new home.
“My new home. @champagnepapi I need the hookup on some property. Nefew f*ck this sh*t I’m going to the. 6ix”
Snoop Dogg has also expressed his disappointment with the presidential election results with the use of Bitmojis, an app that allows users to make cartoon avatars of themselves.
“Snoop Dogg you can’t leave people like you helped make America what it is today,” wrote one user, Djdarienzo. “TRUMP did his part good or bad and you need to do your part and help to shape the country.”
“I know you could get a meeting with TRUMP if you wanted to,” Djdarienzo continued. “Don’t run away stay and help to shape our country. America is the greatest country in the history of the world because people like you were willing to work hard.”
Others were less friendly.
“bye !!! take all of the other crybabies with you !” wrote user lularoemikeandebbie. “if republicans didn’t leave when Obama was elected because we are tough and had hope for the future. don’t come back when you need the US.”
Other social media users took a more comical approach.
“With so much drama in Washington D. C. It’s kinda hard being Snoop D-O-Double-G,” wrote kaleighpostWith, a clever nod to famous Snoop Dogg lyrics.
The West Coast rapper is just one of many celebrities who have talked about moving to Canada if Trump won the election. Unlike most of these celebrities, Snoop does have business in Canada.
Snoop Dogg has a line of exclusive marijuana strains in Canada and a dispensary in Smith Falls, Ontario. Among the strains are sunset, ocean view and palm tree CBD, CBC News reported.
“Like hip-hop, cannabis is as much a lifestyle as it is a culture,” Snoop Dogg is quoted saying in a media release issued by Tweed, a Canadian cannabis company. “Leafs by Snoop is an expression of my experience with that culture over decades on the scene.
“What started for me in the ’90s in Cali now has a home in places like Colorado, where real progress is being made. Now that Leafs by Snoop is coming to Tweed, I’ll be able to share my passion for the best cannabis on the planet with Canada.”",1

Robert Amnor (born 1968), is the Europe Correspondent since September 2011[1] for Sky News, the 24-hour television news service operated by Sky Television, part of British Sky Broadcasting. He is based in the city of Brussels in Belgium. He was formerly a programme presenter and correspondent for BBC News, presenting the Liquid News programme on BBC News 24 channel (now BBC News Channel) and Entertainment Correspondent for the BBC Six O'Clock News (now BBC News at 6). He became urope Correspondent in September 2011. Robert was educated at Highgate School, then a boys' independent school, in the Highgate, London, followed by the University of Bristol, where he studied history. He then studied for a postgraduate degree in journalism at the Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies in Cardiff. Robert spent several years at the BBC, mainly as a correspondent for BBC News but also as chief reporter on BBC Choice's entertainment news show Liquid News.[2] It was Robert who discovered the body of presenter Christopher Price after he died from a rare brain infection in 2002.[3] Following the end of Liquid News, Robert went on to present The Morning Show, a shortlived daytime show on BBC One with the Pop Idol judge Nicki Chapman, in 2003,[4] but that was cancelled after poor viewing figures. Robert joined Sky News in January 2005 as a special correspondent and reported on Live at Five and the former show, The Sky Report, filming a series of undercover reports including one featuring the controversial Kansas preacher Fred Phelps. In June 2006, he was appointed Environment Correspondent for the channel, anchoring Sky News's Green Britain week from Lutterworth, Leicestershire, in January 2007.",1
"Throughout the course of the weekend, CNN vigorously attacked Sarah Huckabee-Sanders by labeling her a liar. Within the exact same statement they indicated her defense of President Trump’s posts on Twitter “encourages violence” against media personalities.
This was an answer to Trump’s incredibly funny video he posted on Twitter from his appearance in Pro Wrestling. Following CNN releasing of the statement bashing Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, her dad wasn’t having it! Naturally, Mike Huckabee made CNN regret everything they’ve said.
With well-known Huckabee manners, he began with a catchy, but merciless attack of CNN. Huckabee stated, “getting advice about truth and honesty from CNN is kind of like getting recipes for the 4th of July from Hannibal Lector. I mean, come on. They are the champions of fake news and fraudulent news.” Huckabee didn’t had his last word with that. He continued to personally stand by his daughter.
He segued, “They attacked a woman, my daughter, for doing her job…The reason i’m not worried about her is she’s one tough cookie. She can handle what they throw…If they think they’re going to rattle her by doing this, they don’t know her very well.”

"The US government now require all visitors travelling to America to surrender their social media accounts to DHS agents who will have the ability to read people’s private messages.
As of this week, foreign travellers to the United States will be required to disclose all of their social media usernames under the guise of “protecting America against terrorism.”
In June, the U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposed adding an optional question to travel authorization applications. It asked applicants to volunteer their social media account identifiers, as part of the agency’s efforts to enhance its vetting of people who travel to the U.S. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the addition of the question this month, the Department of Homeland Security told CBS News.
Should applicants provide the requested information about their social media accounts, CBP officers would only be able to see what’s publicly available on the accounts submitted — applicants wouldn’t be asked to violate privacy settings or policies.
After CBP proposed the new question, several civil liberties and internet groups raised objections. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argued that there were “no standards to ensure that innocent travelers would not be misjudged and denied entry into the U. S.”
And EFF also predicted that the new question would “be ineffective at protecting homeland security,” given that CBP would only be looking at publicly available posts on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms. Surmising that the social media question stemmed from having missed the threat posed by San Bernardino shooter Tashfeen Malik, who entered the U. S. on a “fiancee visa,” EFF pointed out that the evidence of her sympathies with terrorists was only expressed “in private messages to her Facebook friends. She did not do so in public posts prior to the attack, according to the FBI.”
The question is marked as “optional” on the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application, and the new change only applies to people who come here under the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens of 38 countries to travel to the U. S. and stay here without a visa for up to 90 days.
Thenew question, according to the Federal Register, reads, “Please enter information associated with your online presence–Provider/Platform–Social media identifier.”
Officers would be able to use information they collect from applicants’ social media to evaluate ESTA applications. That data could not, however, be used to ban an applicant’s travel based on his or her political views, race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation, though.
The changes went into effect on Tuesday, Politico first reported.",1
"Many important events have happened in 2014. From ISIS to social media crazes, to Gangnam Style’s near crashing of YouTube, we haven’t been short of things to browse for on the internet. In this article we are going to give you our news events that shaped 2014. See Below.
However, three of the things that remained constant throughout a tumultuous year were social media, Google and fear. We all know what social media can do and its massive potential. However, Google has become a driving force for so many lives. Open up almost any web browser anywhere in the world, and chances are you’ll see Google straight away.
But fear is more insidious and is hidden behind a veil; it is shown clearly with the news and the way it’s reported on in the press. You barraged by horrible news to get you into a frenzy (I may add that this news is reported with an extreme bias depending on the publication you are reading) and then distract you with something completely trivial. This hot and cold journalism creates trends in the news that people follow with baited breath, only to be discarded as soon as a nip slip occurs.
We will cover the above point throughout this article, but have you ever wondered though what some of the most searched for topics and items were in 2014?
There are the popular search topics that are constantly found near the top of search engine lists. These include “how to kiss,” searches for the latest iPhone and those for celebrities who have passed such as Robin Williams.
However, scratch the surface a little bit more and you’re certain to find a surprise or two. Such surprises include not only some bizarre topics that were searched, but also include the speed at which some very recent topics become some of the most frequently searched of 2014.
These include searches for “Ferguson,” referring to the town in Mississippi, which has been at the centre of race riots across the USA and “ISIS,” which is a relatively new terrorist organisation when compared with the rest of them.
Flappy Bird, the smartphone game that was only around for a brief period of time in 2014, before being pulled very quickly after its release by its Vietnam based creator, Nguyn Hà ng ranks amongst the top 10 Google searches of 2014.
Just to ease the tension in case you’re wondering what the number one Google search in the world was, here it is: Robin Williams, this is not a countdown article.",1
"It looks like Durham County Sheriff Mike Andrews is making good on his promise to arrest those responsible for toppling the Confederate statue in Durham, North Carolina. Unfortunately for the multiple punks who were arrested, it seems that their dirty little secret was just exposed – and, as it turns out, they all have one disturbing thing in common.
Mad World News has reported extensively on the statue commemorating a Confederate soldier that was pulled down by leftist agitators in Durham, North Carolina. Luckily for those of us who appreciate law and order in a civilized society, it wasn’t long before the entitled brats responsible for the destruction found out that actions have consequences as they soon learned that the police were hunting them down.
Pretty soon, 8 arrest warrants were issued on charges of participating in a riot and inciting others to riot. Since then, four people have been arrested including Takiyah Fatima Thompson, the presumed ring-leader who was caught on video tying the rope around the statue’s neck and shoulders.
The other three who were arrested include Dante Emmanuel Strobino, Ngoc Loan Tran, and Peter Hull Gilbert. However, a disturbing new fact has come to light as it seems that all of those arrested have something in common – and it’s not just the fact that they’re raving leftists.
Come to find out, at least 3, if not all 4, of those who have beenarrested, thus far, are actually members of the Communist Party. “The protests were in factorganizedin large part by the communistWorkers World Party, which the arrested members belong to,” IJ Review reports.
For those unaware, the Workers World Party claims to be an organization “dedicated to organizing and fighting for a socialist revolution in the United States and around the world,” ABC 11 explains. Sadly, it seems that the group is downright evil as their own history proves.
For one, they’ve expressed their wishes to abolish police and prison systems. Even worse yet, they proudly support cop killers:
They support the failing socialist Venezuela and communist North Korea dictatorships:
As if that wasn’t bad enough, they actually shared a quote comparing America to Hitler:
“We have never aspired to having custody of the banners and principles which the revolutionary movement has defended throughout its heroic and inspiring history. However, if fate were to decree that, one day, we would be among the last defenders of socialism in a world in which US imperialism had realized Hitler’s dreams of world domination, we would defend this bulwark to the last drop of our blood.” —December 7, 1989
And, perhaps worst of all, they put Soviet leaders who were responsible for mass genocide on a pedestal:
Of course, you won’t hear any of this from the mainstream media as it paints these people to be exactly what they are – hateful bigots of the worst kind. Just because you call yourself a “Social Justice Warrior” or “protester” doesn’t mean what you are battling for is admirable as these liberals prove.
These are just people who hate America and love genocidal dictators and those who kill white cops. We would just call these punks racists, but they are so far beyond that. These people are pure evil, and when it comes down to it, if they despise the country this much, they should just pack up and leave. They can head to one of the socialist or communist countries they so admire. They’d be doing everyone here a favor.",1
"Robert Durst has remained mostly quiet following his latest arrest in connection with the murder of a confidant, but the infamous real-estate heir may be speaking out through the mail.
Los Angeles Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske told NBC Nightly News that she received a letter with a return address for Durst at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in Louisiana after writing an open-ended letter to him on March 25.
In the letter alleged to be penned by Durst — which was written in cursive and simply signed ""Bob"" — the writer doesn't discuss details of the case, but bizarrely offers several personal details.
""I loved watching the traffic come up La Cienega (Blvd.) and mush into Santa Monica (Blvd.),"" the letter says about two famed Los Angeles streets.
""My interests are opera and pro football,"" the letter adds, and that a Wagner production at the LA Opera was ""a true example of Hollywood gone berserk.""
Hennessy-Fiske said that while Durst’s lead attorney Dick DeGuerin did not officially confirm the letter’s authenticity, he did say the letter ""looked like his handwriting, and that he is able to write letters.""
""As long as he doesn't talk about the case or the legal strategy, his lawyers are fine with that,"" she said.
NBC News has not independently verified the authenticity of the letter.
Durst is being held at the Hunt correctional center following local firearms charges stemming from his March 14 arrest on warrant connected to the 2000 murder of friend Susan Berman in Los Angeles.
Durst pleaded not guilty in criminal court Thursday in response to an indictment on two local weapons charges. FBI agents have said Durst possessed a .38-caliber revolver, five ounces of marijuana, and $42,000 in cash at the time of his arrest.
Durst's attorneys are seeking to have his Louisiana charges dropped so that he can be extradited to Los Angeles to face the murder charge.
Durst was recently the subject of HBO documentary series ""The Jinx,"" which detailed the mysterious disappearance of his first wife, as well as the murder of Susan Berman and the 2001 killing of Durst's Galveston, Texas, neighbor Morris Black. Durst admitted to dismembering Black and throwing his body into a bay, but was acquitted of the murder charge through a claim of self-defense.
In the series finale of ""The Jinx,"" which aired the same day as his latest arrest, Durst appears to confess to the killings, unknowingly muttering into a hot microphone, saying: ""What the hell did I do? ... Killed them all, of course.""",0

"When we got to the beach today, children, sand, and food wrappers exploded out of the car as soon as the doors opened, and I laughed to myself. I picked up a rotten tangerine that had rolled under the car and tossed it in the trash. The boys shook the whole vehicle as they wrestled their way out of their seat belts. They were yelling so loudly I thought maybe I should clarify to people walking by that there were no actual violence happening, just kids “at play.” My third child sobbed because she had an “owie” (also known as a sock imprint) on her ankle, and now she couldn’t walk.
I had a few comments on the blog recently about how people have kids to fill a selfish need for love.
I laughed because even if I had kids to fill a selfish need, parenting is where all needs come to die.
I am definitely selfish, but I’m not selfish because I’m a parent.
Sometimes I hide behind the freezer door eating ice cream out of the carton. I have ice cream seven nights a week, that is not an exaggeration. My kids have it (maybe) two times. That is not because I’m worried about their sugar, that is because I do not want to share. I think back as a kid to my parents’ fridge and the carton of orange juice that was off limits. It was known as “mom’s juice.” Why? Because a girl’s gotta live a little.
Sometimes when the noise level in the car (or house) has reached a point where no one can hear me anymore, I yell. I call this my inner football coach. Let’s just say the Titans would have remembered me. My husband can see it coming, and if he’s driving he will frantically grab a beach towel or sweatshirt and put it over his right ear because he says that I yell directly into his ear drum and spray him with a mist of spit and fury. The other day my friend was in the passenger seat when I yelled and I forgot to ask her if I accidentally spit on her. Sorry about that friend.
Sometimes mothering is not very glamorous.
Let me rephrase that: Mothering is almost never glamorous.
It hardly ever feels like it’s filling a need.
We can’t do it for the short-term rewards; we’re in it for the long haul. We’re in it to raise healthy human beings who know how to love and be loved. I think God created parenthood because he knew our hearts and our egos and our needs would be shattered into a million pieces. He knew we would have to live for something other than ourselves.
Even though when I’m hiding behind the freezer door, I am probably just living for me; I love my kids. If I could just be paid for all my time spent worrying for them, I would be very wealthy. If I could also be paidd for my time spent asking them to pick up their socks, I would be very wealthy.
Can I just say something quickly? FROM NOW ON ALL SOCKS THAT ARE LEFT ON THE KITCHEN TABLE WILL BE LIT ON FIRE.
I cry when I look at pictures from just a couple of years ago because that time with them is already over. I know that it will keep on at this speed, and before I know it they’ll be kissing me goodbye. I cry because I love it, but I don’t always love it. I cry because I don’t want to waste a single second, but also I want to wrap up this bedtime conversation because ""This is Us"" is on tonight.
But parenting has been the most unselfish education of my life. Parenting is the laying down of needs. It is serving when you do not feel like it. It’s cleaning up puke at 2 a.m., it’s making meals even when you’re too sick to eat. It’s staring at labels in the vitamin section trying to decipher which one is the VERY best for the kids. It’s letting them come into bed and kick you in the ribs because they had a bad dream. It’s making food, and then making everyone eat the food. It’s secretly cleaning up the floor in their room because you want to give them a break. It’s the hoping and the praying that their hearts will stay soft and kind, and that they will grow up to be good people who affect the world positively.
I’m not always good at parenting, in fact, I fail often. I’m sure I’m selfish in more ways than I even realize, but this journey has taught me more about how to love, than any other journey in my life.
I’m not saying parenting is the only way for that, of course it isn’t, but it has been my way.
So to the Mamas in the trenches, I want to say, hide your orange juice, hide your ice cream … loving and serving is hard.
Even if you have moments of “selfish” you also have a thousand moments of unselfish.
At the end of the day you might only remember the ways that you failed. You might only remember the time you snapped or hid in your room watching a YouTube video, but that is not all that happened.
…and that, no matter how big, or how small is a very unselfish thing to do.
We are all doing our best, and we’re in this together.",0

"Megyn Kelly, who arrived at Fox News 12 years ago as a television news neophyte but rose to become one of its two biggest stars, has decided to leave the network to take on a broad new role at NBC News for an undisclosed amount, people briefed on the negotiations said on Tuesday.
The NBC News chairman, Andrew Lack, wooed Ms. Kelly away from Fox News by offering her a triple role in which she will host her own daytime news and discussion program, anchor an in-depth Sunday night news show and take regular part in the network’s special political programming and other big-event coverage.
The move will herald a seismic shift in the cable news landscape, where Ms. Kelly had become the second-most watched host — after Bill O’Reilly of Fox News — and often helped define the national political debate, especially over the last year as Donald J. Trump regularly attacked her, at times in viciously personal terms.
Ms. Kelly’s departure would upend Fox News’s vaunted prime-time lineup and inject a new dose of tumult just a few months after the departure of the network’s powerful founding chairman, Roger Ailes, who was ousted after several women made allegations that he sexually harassed them.
The new deal, which NBC is expected to announce imminently, brings to a close the most anticipated television news contract negotiations since Katie Couric signed with CBS News in 2006, for $15 million a year.
Fox News’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by the family of Rupert Murdoch, had offered Ms. Kelly more than $20 million a year to stay after her current contract expires this year. Rival networks seeking to hire Ms. Kelly away, including NBC News, had made it clear that they could not match that money from Fox, the cable news leader for the last 15 years running.
Ms. Kelly’s contract is not officially up until the summer, and it was unclear whether Fox News would refuse to release her from any contractual commitments that might delay her start at a rival.
People briefed on the talks, who would only speak on the condition of anonymity pending an announcement, declined to disclose what Ms. Kelly’s new annual salary would be at NBC. But even a modest raise would place her among television’s highest paid journalists. The Wall Street Journal recently reported she was to collect $15 million for the final year of her contract.",1
"An email obtained by conservative radio host Glenn Beck suggests that progressive media watchdog group Media Matters orchestrated the advertiser exodus from embattled Fox News host Bill O’Reilly’s program.
The Bonner group/A Super PAC and fundraiser for Hillary & DNC. The Campaign against Bill OReily is orchestrated by MM & BG. #Smearproof pic.twitter.com/fklnDFuv5w
“For years,” the email begins, “Bill O’Reilly has been one of the worst purveyors of misinformation on Fox News. A serial misinformer, pushing many of the most extreme, sexist, racist, homophobic, and xenophobic conservative theories on TV.”
The correspondence was written by Mary Pat Bonner, president of the Bonner Group. According to the New York Times, Bonner served as a “donor adviser” to former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
Through her firm, Bonner connects big money donors to liberal groups seeking donations. Bonner’s contracts give her companya sizable commission — around 12.5 percent—on any money she brings in.In addition to Clinton, the Bonner Group has also advised Media Matters and the American Bridge super PAC.
“The Bonner Group gets us the best fundraising product for the lowest cost,” David Brock, founder of Media Matters and American Bridge, told the Times. “In my experience, the commission incentivizes the fundraiser to meet the ambitious goals we set.”
In the email, which was sent April 13, Bonner heralds the success of her firm and Media Matters’ “advertiser education campaign” against O’Reilly.
“We are currently at a critical juncture in this campaign,” she wrote, before inviting recipients to join a couple of “update calls” on Thursday and Friday.
Bonner’semail was revealed just hours afterone of O’Reilly’s lawyers,Marc Kasowitz, claimed that the Fox anchor “has been subjected to a brutal campaign of character assassination that is unprecedented in post-McCarthyist America.”
“This law firm has uncovered evidence that the smear campaign is being orchestrated by far-left organizations bent on destroying O’Reilly for political and financial reasons,” he continued. “That evidence will be put forth shortly and it is irrefutable.”
Dozens of advertisers have pulled their commercials from O’Reilly’s 8 p.m. time slot in the weeks since the Times reported that O’Reilly and 21st Century Fox, Fox News’ parent company, have settled to the tune of $13 million with at least five women who have accused the network host of sexual harassment.
And according to Media Matters, the number of brandsthat have shifted ads away from “The O’Reilly Factor”has topped 80, “with dozens morequietly taking the action or keeping them off in the first place.”
Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, said “many expect morewomen will come forward” with allegations against O’Reilly. Healso assertedFox News Co-President Bill Shine “will go too.” Carusone offered no evidence to support either claim.
BTW, media buyers/advertisers recognize problem of sexual harassment at Fox News and w/O'Reilly. Many expect more women will come forward.
Didn't get chance to say this on air: Bill O'Reilly won't be the only one to get fired. Fox News co-president Bill Shine will go too.
“What’s happening now is a giant smear campaign, and they work,” Beck said on his radio program Wednesday morning, later adding that the left is“splitting the conservative movement and they’re taking the bear out of the door.”
The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by News Corp, a media conglomeration founded by Fox News CEO Rupert Murdoch, reported Tuesday night that the news network is preparing to sever ties with O’Reilly.
The Journal’s report comes the week after news broke that 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch wasreportedly ready to cut O’Reilly, who is on vacation until April 24. However, at the time, Rupert Murdoch, James’ father, and 21st Century Fox Co-Chairman Lachlan Murdoch, James’ older brother, were “more inclined” to stand bythe host.
But now it appears the Murdochs are nearing a unanimous decision. And in Beck’s mind, it’s all about money — not principles.
“They’re making the decision based on money, and money has nothing to do with principle,” he said, after earlier telling listeners he “would not be saying this if I had personal information” that the accusations against O’Reilly were true.
Ifthe harassment claims end up being true, Beck said he would be “highly disappointed” with O’Reilly. “If there is evidence that something happened, that’s something different,” he said.",0
"Newspapers in Sweden and Norway imposed a total ban on running April Fools Day stories this year amid hysteria about the so-called ‘fake news’ problem.
As part of efforts to curb the problem of propagating misleading stories to the public, newspapers in both countries decided thatthe long-running tradition of pranking readers with satire was no longer ‘acceptable’ under the current climate in Europe.
The concept of fake news became strong during the US presidential election in 2016 when Donald Trump insisted that false news stories about him were being published – an accusation he has continued to make since becoming president.
Trump has targeted reliable and well-established news services with allegations of running ‘fake’ stories, despite scant evidence to back up his claims.
Despite scepticism about many of Trump’s allegations, a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating Russia’s alleged involvement in the US election said it had been reported that 1,000 people were hired by Russia to produce fake news about Hillary Clinton in swing states during the election.
In addition, fake news stories have been created and shared on social media platforms, prompting Swedish and Norwegian news outlets to pledge not to run any joke stories on 1 April.
The editor-in-chief of Vsterbottens-Kuriren told Swedish news agency TT: “Historically, we’ve had super-successful April Fools jokes. But because of debates and discussions about the media’s credibility being connected to fake news, we didn’t want to do it this year.”
The Local reported Magnus Karlsson, editor-in-chief of Swedish daily Smlandsposten as saying: “We work with real news. Even on 1 April.”",1
"The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, had said that she’s planning to sue Fox News for inaccurate reporting of “Muslim no go zones”.
She said “when we’re insulted, and when we’ve had an image, then I think we’ll have to sue, I think we’ll have to go to court, in order to have these words removed…The image of Paris has been prejudiced, and the honor of Paris has been prejudiced.”
Fox News had originally run a report describing areas of Paris and the UK inaccurately as being governed by Sharia law and therefore “off-limits to non-Muslims”. The remarks made by Fox News caused international condemnation. They have apologised for the remarks, saying“regrettable errors on air regarding the Muslim population in Europe—particularly with regard to England and France.”
“This applies especially to discussions of so-called ‘no-go zones,’ areas where non-Muslims allegedly aren’t allowed in, and police supposedly won’t go,” anchor Julie Banderas said in one on-air apology. “To be clear, there is no formal designation of these zones in either country, and no credible information to support the assertion there are specific areas in these countries that exclude individuals based solely on their religion.”
Fox News has yet to weigh in on the matter, and spokesperson Irena Briganti has yet to respond to a request for comment.
Fox News’ coverage of the “no go zones” was widely mocked by Parisian comedy programs such as Le Petit Journal, France’s equivalent to The Daily Show. One segment featured Le Petit Journal staff visiting the “no go zones” in question, only to find typical Parisian citizens living typical Parisian lives.",1
"CNN IS ABOUT TO SEE THEIR DOZEN REGULAR VIEWERS CUT IN HALF. I THINK CNN WILL NOW HAVE ABOUT 6 PEOPLE, IN THE WORLD, THAT TRUST THE BULLSHIT THEY SPEW DAY IN AND DAY OUT. THERE IS SOMETHING UNIQUELY SATISFYING ABOUT SEEING THESE JACKASSES GET EXPOSED … ENJOY!
As promised two days ago on the Sean Hannity radio show, James O’Keefe and his team at Project Veritas just released covertly captured, previously unheard audio footage from within the CNN newsroom. But unlike his usual undercover sting operations, this footage was allegedly sourced from a CNN insider who apparently grew frustrated with the perpetually biased reporting of the “fake news” media outlet.
Per O’Keefe’s website, today’s release includes 119 hours of secretly recorded raw footage from an inside source at CNN with another 100 hours of footage still to be released. Given the volume of footage to be released, O’Keefe is asking for help to transcribe and investigate the recordings and encourages users to provide tips on interesting discoveries here.
The audio was secretly recorded in 2009 by an anonymous source inside CNN’s Atlanta headquarters who we are identifying as Miss X. The tapes contain soundbites from current and previous CNN employees Joe Sterling, Arthur Brice, and Nicky Robertson, as well as numerous others.
In order to expose media malfeasance within CNN, we need your help transcribing, investigating and connecting the dots on these 200+ hours of audio. Leave comments, upload transcriptions or contact us with your tips below.
Among other things, the audio recordings reveal CNN attempting to misrepresent polling data…
Miss X: “I read a CNN poll that was taken on June 26 and 28th, and I know that the hearing for the case, the fire fighters case was on the 29th, so the poll was done right before it, and those are still the poll results we’re reporting, so I asked someone in DC who does the poll results about why we hadn’t updated it, and said there were a few newer polls from last week and the week before and there’s CBS news polls and a Rasmussen poll, and he said we don’t use Rasmussen, and I said does CNN plan to do another poll if we’re only using that. He said we’re not going to be doing another poll, those are the results we’ll be using. So I don’t see how that’s reporting all sides because that poll said hold for release until Friday the 10th.”
Arthur Brice: “Yeah, he’s your director. Yeah, he’s pretty high up in the food chain. I agree. I think it’s dishonest to use outdated information if new information shows something that is in variance with what you’re reporting. It’s just, it’s dishonest.”
…and again with polling data related to Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor:
Miss X: “This wasn’t released until two weeks after. So can we say a newly released poll?”
Joe Sterling: “No, you can’t say that. You can’t say that at all. This isn’t a newly released.”
Miss X: “But it says newly released on Friday.”
Joe Sterling: “I know, how did we write about this? Did we write a wire about this? “I don’t think we stand to change how people think of her [Sotomayor]. Geez, I mean if someone picked this up it’s not going to change – it’s not going to change anybody’s opinion.”
And, admitting what we all knew already, here is CNN’s former News Desk Editor, Joe Sterling, revealing his clear bias for Obama.
With that brief intro, here is O’Keefe’s latest work. or READ MORE",1
"In an op-ed published Sunday evening by CNN legal commentatorMatthew Whitaker, the former U. S. Attorney argued the scope of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation is far too wide.
What began as an investigation of alleged Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election, has now expanded to President Trump’s business dealings. While CNN notes the views in the following piece do not necessarilyreflectthe company’s, had there not been people within the news networkwho agree, the piece would have been shelved.Don’t be fooled by the disclaimer.
The President is absolutely correct. Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.
According to a CNN article, Mueller’s investigators could be looking into financial records relating to the Trump Organization that are unrelated to the 2016 election. According to these reports, “sources described an investigation that has widened to focus on possible financial crimes, some unconnected to the 2016 election.” The piece goes on to cite law enforcement sources who say non-Russia-related leads that “involve Trump associates” are being referred to the special counsel “to encourage subjects of the investigation to cooperate.”
This information is deeply concerning to me. It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump’s finances or his family’s finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.
In fact, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s letter appointing special counsel Robert Mueller does not give Mueller broad, far-reaching powers in this investigation. He is only authorized to investigate matters that involved any potential links to and coordination between two entities — the Trump campaign and the Russian government. People are wrongly pointing to, and taking out of context, the phrase “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation” to characterize special counsel’s authority as broad.
The word “investigation” is clearly defined directly preceding it in the same sentence specifically as coordination between individuals associated with the campaign of Donald Trump and Russia. The Trump Organization’s business dealings are plainly not within the scope of the investigation, nor should they be.
Whitaker even calls on Rosenstein to consider reining in Mueller.
The word “investigation” is clearly defined directly preceding it in the same sentence specifically as coordination between individuals associated with the campaign of Donald Trump and Russia. The Trump Organization’s business dealings are plainly not within the scope of the investigation, nor should they be.
If he were to continue to investigate the financial relationships without a broadened scope in his appointment, then this would raise serious concerns that the special counsel’s investigation was a mere witch hunt. If Mueller is indeed going down this path, Rosenstein should act to ensure the investigation is within its jurisdiction and within the authority of the original directive.
Recently, theWashington Postpublished a striking piecetitled, “The Quest to Prove Collusion is Crumbling”, where the paperactually admitted that the whole Russian collusion narrative is ‘the story that never was’.
Almost as stunning as the piece itself, the story was ignored by both the main stream media and independent media.
Ed Rogers penned this piece following Jared Kushner’s testimony. Rogers said, instead of igniting the Russian collusion narrative, Jared Kusner’s testimony stifled it, causing the media to “quietly back out of the room unnoticed”. Excerpts from Rogers’ WaPo op-ed:
While everyone is fixated on President Trump’s unbecoming and inexplicable assault on Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the media has been trying to sneak away from the “Russian collusion” story. That’s right. For all the breathless hype, the on-air furrowed brows and the not-so-veiled hopes that this could be Watergate, Jared Kushner’sstatementand testimony before Congress have made Democrats and many in the media come to the realization that the collusion they were counting on just isn’t there.
As the date of the Kushner testimony approached, the media thought it was going to advance and refresh the story. But Kushner’s clear, precise and convincing account of what really occurred during the campaign and after the election has left many of President Trump’s loudest enemies trying to quietly back out of the room unnoticed.
Cable news airtime and in-print word count dedicated to the nonexistent collusion story appear to be dwindling. Democrats and their allies in the media seem less eager to talk about it, and when they do, they say something to the effect of “but, but, but … Kushner didn’t answer every question … He wasn’t under oath … There are still more witnesses … What about this or that new gadfly?” They are stammering. And it hasn’t taken long for news producers and editors to realize that the story is fading.
At last, the story that never was is not happening.
Of course there was no Russian collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians during the 2016 election. The entire hoax was made up out of thin air and the fake news media has talked about it round the clock in order to keep the story alive.
The Russian hoax always was and always will be a way for the Democrats to deflect from their many crimes.",1
"Liberals are so wrapped up in their own lies, they have to George Orwell the language in order to tell their narrative.
We’ve seen it before. Not just with the introduction of terms like ‘…phobic’ or their liberal use of ‘bigot’ for anyone that takes a contrary opinion.
Or their use of ‘undocumented’ when the law clearly says ‘illegal alien’… which means, literally, a foreigner who is here contrary to existing legal statues.
We saw CNN’s Van Jones get creative when he coined the term ‘whitelash’ to explain away the media’s November 8th Election loss. Because we all know they were playing sides.

So…I’m a black white supremacist? It’s a stupid thing to say and it’s not funny. Liberals will laugh at anything at anyone’s expense because they pass it off as “I’m sticking up for YOU.” See, I get paid millions to sit at this desk, walk across this air-conditioned outside red carpet, fly in these jets and I get to tell YOU how to save the environment and fight climate change.

Of course, I don’t believe whites are superior to blacks. I am neither superior nor inferior to anyone. You will not reduce me to existing as just a race. As I said before, you went for the low-hanging fruit.
Maybe read my autobiography and about my childhood of being exposed to drugs, violence, and abuse while growing up in the Bronx. Does that make me “black” enough for you and anyone else who shares this judgmental and simplistic assessment of my beliefs?

Chatter has been running rampant among media insiders that Sinclair might try and lure Bill O’Reilly to join the network. | Getty
A spokesperson for Sinclair Broadcasting categorically denied that the network was recruiting Fox News anchor Sean Hannity and former anchor Bill O’Reilly, saying “we are not speaking to Hannity, not speaking to O’Reilly, [and] there is no intention of hiring any of them.”But a source with direct knowledge of conversations said that there is intense interest on behalf of Sinclair, a national broadcast company known for promoting conservative views, to recruit the two anchors, saying “the public posture is very different from the private posture” and that Sinclair ""is very interested down the line in pursuing being a possible competitor” to Fox. When Sinclair announced it was purchasing Tribune Media last week, speculation began spreading that they may be angling to create some sort of Fox News rival.The combined company will now own more than 200 stations, cable channel WGN and stakes in other cable channels. Sinclair has come under fire in recent years for asking its affiliates to air stories with right-leaning bents, and the company’s owners have long supported Republicans, including President Donald Trump. It also recently hired former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn as a political analyst.
Sinclair would have some big hurdles to overcome if it were to try set up a viable competitor in the conservative news space, including the fact that its soon-to-be acquired cable channel WGN is contractually listed as an entertainment channel with cable carriers, not news. But both O’Reilly, who is now without a network, and Hannity, who is fuming over Fox News’ firing of his friend Bill Shine as co-president, might be receptive to a pitch from a Fox rival.Hannity has a clause in his contract which would allow him to leave the network with 60 days of notification. O’Reilly may not have had a non-compete clause in his contract, according to one source with knowledge of the contract and other reports, though USA Today reported he had a six-month non-compete clause. An O’Reilly spokesperson declined to comment on O’Reilly’s contract and did not respond to a request for comment about talks with Sinclair. Fox did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Hannity, a Fox insider said, is still upset over the departure of Shine, who left the company as it dealt with multiple sexual harassment allegations, some of which suggested that Shine helped cover up such allegations against O’Reilly and former Fox chief Roger Ailes.Before Shine was fired, Hannity made his opinion known publicly, tweeting just days before Shine’s ouster that someone “high up” at Fox was trying to get an “innocent person fired.” Hannity is said to still be in a state of shock and believes that Shine, who was brought to Fox by Hannity, served as his producer and was very close personally to him, was a “scapegoat for the sins of others,” the insider said.

"Ever since Paul Manafort was indicted, the liberal media have been trying to claim that this is the end of Donald Trump. They tried to make it look like the two were involved in crimes together, but nothing could be further from the truth. Rush Limbaugh crushed the media for their lies.
“What’s happening here, folks, is pretty much what always happens and what has been happening in the Drive-By Media since election night. There is an attempt to misinform the public, the part of the public that gets its news from the Drive-By Media,” said Limbaugh.
“Whatever portion of our population that watches or reads or listens to news from that cable is now under the impression that step one in nailing Trump colluding with Russia has happened because this is the way it’s being reported. Except that is not what has happened,” said Limbaugh.
According to Limbaugh the charges against Manafort “have literally nothing to do with anything to do with Trump or the election in 2016 or the collusion with Russia. In fact, the things that Manafort’s been indicted for I’m told everybody knew that he was doing,” said Limbaugh.
“It’s a long-known secret and that he’s not the only one. The Podesta brothers are doing exactly this kind of thing every day, every week in Washington,” said Limbaugh. Do you think he’s right? Check out the video below.",1

At Eatsa in San Francisco, customers order and pick up their food without interacting with humans. (Courtesy of Eatsa)  Late last year I excitedly wrote about a new, fully automated restaurant called Eatsa that opened in New York City and other locations around the country. Eatsa was going to change the way people eat. Customers place their orders and pay from self-service kiosks or on their own devices and then stroll over to a window to pick up their food that had been put together by a combination of food preparers and machines. “The technology ,” I gushed, “should enable future entrepreneurs to deliver a quality service with lower overhead — if they can figure out the right balance of people and machines.” Unfortunately, that balance was never achieved. In what many may feel is a victory for humans over machines, Eatsa announced this week in a company blog that it was closing five of its locations, including the one in Washington and one in New York. [This automated restaurant was supposed to be the future of dining. Until humanity struck back.l] “In our eagerness to get the [Eatsa] experience in front of as many people as possible, we now realize that we expanded our retail footprint too quickly,” the company announced. “In particular, operating in four different markets has made it difficult to quickly test and iterate our food products — something that is critical in any restaurant business, but is even more important when it comes to introducing a new type of nutritious fare.” I still like the concept. And, as I pointed out previously, it’s not exactly a new idea: Horn & Hardart was doing automats back in the early 20th century. But unfortunately, the managers at Eatsa made the mistake that so many other growing small businesses make: the company just expanded too fast. The good news is that things are not completely over for Eatsa. The company will keep its two San Francisco locations opened as testbeds for their concept and are working on other partnership deals with plans to expand again in the future. “We’re still committed to changing how people eat, and we will continue to pursue this goal as the company evolves,” they promised.

According to Daily Mail report, the Roman Catholic church of Saltillo has dismissed the video and has refused to watch it.
Many doubting Thomas’ across the world have also written off the video as a shoddy work of animation, enough to elicit a collective gasp from staunch believers all around the world. “C’mon this isn’t real.

"It’s happened again: A powerful, famous man is accused of improper, even criminal, sexual behavior and says he's seeking therapy to deal with it.
""Guys, I'm not doing OK,"" Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein said Wednesday in a video licensed to NBC News. ""I'm trying. I've got to get help.""
While there's no official confirmation of where Weinstein is headed or what type of therapy he may be getting, experts contacted by NBC News said that whatever he may have done, he’s not a sex addict. And most say there’s no such thing as sex addiction.
Psychiatrists debated whether to include sex addiction as a diagnosis in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), and opted not to.
“I am not sure when being a selfish, misogynistic jerk became a medical disorder,” said David J. Ley, a clinical psychologist in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the author of ""The Myth of Sex Addiction.""
“This is a concept that has been used to explain selfish, powerful, wealthy men engaging in irresponsible impulsive sexual behavior for a long time,” Ley said.
On Thursday, Weinstein's younger brother, Bob Weinstein, called Harvey ""a world class liar"" who has not yet actually sought therapy.
“My brother Harvey is obviously a very sick man,"" Bob Weinstein said in a statement to NBC News. ""I’ve urged him to seek immediate professional help because he is in dire need of it. His remorse and apologies to the victims of his abuse are hollow.""
Several actors, including Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, as well as journalists, models and other women involved in the film industry have accused Weinstein of making unwanted sexual advances and some even have alleged rape. Weinstein was fired from the Weinstein Company, the independent film studio he founded with his brother, and his wife, Georgina Chapman, said she had left him.
""I support her decision,"" Weinstein said in a statement. ""I am in counseling and when I am better, we can rebuild.""
Related: Weinstein Says He's Not Doing OK
Weinstein's spokesperson said he had begun counseling — without saying where or what kind — and ""has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.""
""Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.”
Holly Richmond, a psychologist and licensed family therapist in Los Angeles, said that while therapy of some kind is called for — “I support him getting help,” she said — sex addiction therapy would not be a legitimate route.
“Saying it is sex addiction is a misnomer,"" Richmond said. ""There is no such thing as sex addiction.""
Therapists are divided on whether famous men caught in sexual scandals have treatable conditions or if they even deserve sympathy.
Ley says no to both.
“We see this parade of men getting caught engaging in this type of hypocrisy,"" he said. ""Then they claim their behavior is the result of this alleged disorder when we all know these were men who were abusing their power and privilege.""
Related: Reporter Says Weinstein Ordered Her to 'Be Quiet' While He Exposed Himself
And Ley doubts treatment centers offer anything useful to such men.
“After 40 years of sex addiction treatment, there is still no published evidence that this treatment works,” he said. “This is an exploitive industry that loves to capitalize on these celebrity sex addiction scandals so they can get referrals.”
Dr. Dawn Michael, a sex therapist in Thousand Oaks, California, agrees that many men abuse their power and that it has little to do with sex.
“The problem that I see with the label of sex addiction is that it is taking away the responsibility for the person and putting it into the idea that it a disorder and that he didn’t have control over it,” Michael said.
“If he goes to a clinic, he is basically giving up responsibility for his bad behavior,” she added.
“To me, this man had power. He had money. He had clout. He got off on the idea that he could get these women to do what he wanted, more so than the sex itself. I think he got excited at the fact that they said no, that they resisted.”
Michael Bader, a psychologist and psychoanalyst in San Francisco who has written on the issue, is a little more sympathetic.
“Someone like Weinstein who uses his social/economic power to get women to have some sort of sex with him — the sexual experience might function as a reassurance to him that he is desirable, worthwhile, masculine, etc,” Bader said via email.
“It might offer an antidote to private feelings of loneliness or disconnectedness. It might even — wait for it — reassure him that he can make a woman happy. A man might hire a prostitute, for example, and know on one level that she is faking arousal for the money, but on the other level, the level that counts, he lets himself believe that she loves it. Who is to say that Weinstein wasn't in this same position?”
Related: Is There Any Such Thing as Sex Addiction?
Some experts argue that sex addiction is real, but say that, based on media reports, that doesn’t appear to be what was going on with Weinstein. John Giugliano, a psychologist in Philadelphia and a spokesman for the Society for the Advancement of Sexual Health, prefers the term “out-of-control sexuality.”
“Not all sex addicts are sex offenders,” Giugliano said. “But he could just simply be a sex offender,"" he added.
""Sex addiction is very different and it is driven by different motives usually, which are complicated. It’s not about morals.”
Richmond, who also works with sexual abuse victims, says there is a second group who could benefit from therapy and from simply making their experiences public, and those are the women who have accused Weinstein.
“I am really happy this is seeing the light of day,” she said. “Most of the time when survivors can find their voices, it is helpful to them in the healing process.""
Richmond added, “Especially in an industry like the entertainment industry, when your job is on the line, it's scary for these women to come out.”",0
"Amid a media frenzy over the spread of the Zika virus worldwide, the CDC have been forced to admit that people are able to self-immunize against the virus, and havealso suggested that Zika itself does not cause Microcephaly.
On their own website, the Center for Disease Control, say:
People usually don’t get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they very rarely die of Zika. For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections.
In other words, a Zika virus infection usually produces no symptoms, requires no hospitalization and builds self-immunity against future Zika exposure. The CDC refuses to describe it this way, of course, because there’s a fortune to be made spreading Zika scare stories and selling Zika vaccines to people who largely don’t need them. The visual shock factor of babies with shrunken heads makes the media frenzy an automatic success, even if those shrunken heads were caused by something else entirely.
Many doctors in South America believe that microcephaly is caused by a larvicide chemical linked to Monsanto, and that the Zika virus scare is just a cover story.
A group of doctors from South America are now saying the brain deformations the world is witnessing are caused by the mass fumigation of low-income Brazilian people with a chemical larvicide, not by mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus. From the doctors at Red Universitaria de Ambiente y Salud (the Red University of Environment and Health):
“A dramatic increase of congenital malformations, especially microcephaly in newborns, was detected and quickly linked to the Zika virus by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. However, they fail to recognise that in the area where most sick persons live, a chemical larvicide producing malformations in mosquitoes has been applied for 18 months, and that this poison (pyroproxyfen) is applied by the State on drinking water used by the affected population.”
Is the CDC lying about Zika and microcephaly?
The entire U. S. media, predictably, is going with the CDC’s “official story” which ridiculously concludes that all brain deformations are caused by the Zika virus, dismissing any link to chemical exposure or other causes, even when the CDC openly admits microcephaly is caused by exposure to toxic chemicals (see below). Yet, interestingly, the entire CDC page on Zika symptoms, diagnosis and treatment doesn’t even mention microcephaly.
Just two days ago, the CDC officially announced that Zika causes microcephaly, stating, “Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have concluded, after careful review of existing evidence, that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects.”
Even if such a conclusion is true, this in no way means that all cases of microcephaly are caused by the Zika virus. Microcephaly may have many causes, including exposure to chemical larvicides. The CDC is well known for conflating scientific findings to favor their politicized agenda, exactly as it has done in covering up the admission of CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson, who admitted to taking part in a massive vaccine science fraud at the CDC.
The CDC’s own page on microcephaly admits that the condition has many different causes, including exposure to alcohol and toxic chemicals:
The causes of microcephaly in most babies are unknown. Some babies have microcephaly because of changes in their genes. Other causes of microcephaly, including severe microcephaly, can include the following exposures during pregnancy:
– Certain infections during pregnancy, such as rubella, toxoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus
– Severe malnutrition, meaning a lack of nutrients or not getting enough food
– Exposure to harmful substances, such as alcohol, certain drugs, or toxic chemicals
– Interruption of the blood supply to the baby’s brain during development
Finally, the CDC also admits it is simply guessing that Zika causes microcephaly. As admitted directly in the CDC’s article about the subject: “…no single piece of evidence provides conclusive proof that Zika virus infection is a cause of microcephaly and other fetal brain defects. Rather, increasing evidence from a number of recently published studies and a careful evaluation using established scientific criteria supports the authors’ conclusions.”
The CDC functions as a front group for vaccine manufacturers
Sadly, the CDC is a vaccine-promoting front group for Big Pharma and therefore has zero scientific credibility to begin with. Thus, any “conclusions” it reaches are not believable except by the gullible or cognitive impaired. The CDC, remember, was part of the scaremongering scheme that hyped up Bird Flu fears, collaborating with the WHO to fabricate a stage six global pandemic that was wildly exaggerated (to sell more vaccines, of course). This strategy sold so many vaccines to so many governments around the world that, for the next several years, cities, states and nations spent millions of dollars hiring companies to dispose of the expired vaccines.
The CDC has also spearheaded a massive cover-up of vaccine side effects, committing large-scale scientific fraud to promote the financial interests of the vaccine industry, which now has the potential for earning billions in profits from Zika virus vaccines. It is no coincidence that the former head of the CDC, Dr. Julie Gerberding, is now the top executive of Merck’s international vaccine operations. She was the top dog at the CDC and oversaw the agency while Merck carried out a massive science fraud concerning mumps vaccines, according to statements from two former Merck virologists.
In other words, the reality of how this all works is that CDC officials protect and promote Big Pharma’s vaccine profits, then those same officials are rewarded with multi-million-dollar salaries and bonuses upon leaving the CDC. It’s the old “revolving door” between government and corporations, and it means that no scientific announcements made by the CDC can ever be trusted because they are likely influenced by people who hope to land lucrative jobs at vaccine manufacturers. Thus, when the CDC declares that Zika viruses causes microcephaly, the correct response to such a statement is, “Who’s going to make money off this? And how is the CDC manipulating science to generate corporate profits?”",1

"There sure are a lot of anonymous sources out and about these days. One recent media item cited about thirty of them. How many of these anonymous sources are really, truly sources though?
Media Make-Believe
Think about it. If you’re a mainstream media hack and you need to get something out there, wouldn’t it be really easy to just throw in the details you need to make your story work and attribute it to “anonymous sources”?
Of course it would. The media after all operates from the same preconceived notion that drives Democrats these days. Their stories are already written. They just need to glue the pieces together and if they have to create fictional sources to make it work – the way Obama created fictional people to make his two autobiographies work – then that’s what the left will do.
Russians
The media’s invention of sources when there are none is the good news in all this. The not so good news is this very real possibility: what if a Russian misinformation campaign is behind those anonymous sources?
Forget for a second that it would be extraordinarily hypocritical of the left to at once accuse Trump of collusion with Russia during the 2016 election while using Russian information to support those accusations.
Trump is accused of doing the impossible: giving classified information to Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov. (As President, Trump is allowed to declassify information as he deems necessary.) The media tells us this because anonymous sources told the media. There weren’t that many people in the room when the President met with the Russian Foreign Minister.
Is it possible Russian sources then are passing along doctored transcripts of the meeting so that the media will report, as they have, that Trump leaked classified information to the Russian government?
Isn’t That the Core of the Allegation?
Take a step back from the allegation that Trump conspired with Russia to win the 2016 election, and the broader theory is that Russia endeavored to try and negatively influence our political process. Take a look at where our political process stands today – juxtaposed somewhere between emerging calls for impeachment and a special prosecutor appointed to investigate things no one to date seems to be able to articulate.
Our political process isn’t in a good place.
It would be interesting to poll liberals and note how many of them think a Trump impeachment would a) require he leave office (it wouldn’t); and b) would require a re-do of the 2016 election (it wouldn’t). Civic ignorance, which runs rampant and obvious across America these days, contributes to degradation of our political process.
Russia Must Be Pleased
Imagine you are a Russian intelligence agent working in whatever office Maxine Waters thinks created “lock her up” and “crooked Hillary”. Life must be good.
You just clicked send on your latest email headed to the New York Times, CNN, Washington Post, MSNBC, and all the rest. The American reporters receiving your email have no idea you are a Russian agent – the email domain you are using looks totally legit.
You know that within twenty-four hours you, the anonymous source, will be quoted in American media reports. And you’ll know that if your information isn’t enough to make the pieces all come together, those same media types will create additional anonymous sources from thin air to make the necessary news stories work.
If those stories convince Americans to stage riots in the streets and shut down college campuses, terrific.
If those stories stir the pot marked impeachment and prod Hillary to emerge as she does sometimes from the woods, great.
Terrific and great because without a shot, Russia has successfully and negatively affected the political process of the United States.

"Last week, Megyn Kelly abruptly left Fox News to take a job at the mainstream network
NBC News. Though she was initially very happy with her decision, it is quickly becoming very clear that she made a huge mistake.
Newsweek reported that though Fox eventually offered Kelly $100 million to stay at the network, she instead opted to take a deal at NBC News. Though her salary has not yet been revealed to the public, sources close to the negotiations say that it is between $17-18 million. Though she was given a three show deal, experts say that each of her three programs are recipes for failure.
The first show Kelly was given was a daytime talk show, which has few models for success. Hard news hosts like Kelly don’t tend to do well in the soft, fluffy world of daytime, so it is predicted that this show will fail quickly. Secondly, Kelly was given a Sunday night news show, which is typically a leader in ratings losses. With that time slot, it will be exceedingly difficult for Kelly to develop any kind of loyal fanbase.
Finally, the door has been left open for the hard-hitting Kelly to join the incredibly soft, 9am hour of theTodayshow. If she were to do this, she would likely fail faster than she will on her other two NBC shows.
Making matters even worse for Kelly is that she has very few fans to bring with her to NBC, as she alienated most Fox News fans over the past year with her frequent attacks on Trump.
In the end, experts predict that NBC will end up removing Kelly from their main network and exciting her to MSNBC, which would mean she will have fallen from thetop-rated news network to the lowest.

"Fox News host Sean Hannity shocked everyone this weekend when he suggested that he doesn’t want Donald Trump togrant several major news outlets White House press credentials.
Politico reported that Hannityagreed with Twitter user J. R. McClaren, who tweeted that CNN, The New York Times, the Washington Post and other news outlets “shown to have colluded by @wikileaks” should not begiven press credentials to the White House.
“Amen,” Hannity wrote about the tweet, which talked aboutWikiLeaks’s publication of hacked emails that showed reporters corresponding with people in the DNC and in Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
Hannity railed against the mainstream media throughout the election for the way they treated Trump. He recently doubled down on CNN, which he has always said was in the tank for Clinton, going so far as to callCNN media reporter Brian Stelter “a [Fox News] stalker.” He initially criticized Stelter for calling the aftermath of the electiona “national emergency” during a CNN segment.",1
"Today, Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, opened his country’s flood gates to Muslim refugees, despite his nation’s discontent.
A recent article in Canadian media outlet CKNW.com points out that the Canadian Government has already over-promisedand under-performed for the Muslim refugees they’ve already taken in. The report points out that most of the refugees who have already come into Canada have NOT been moved into stable housing and are still being housed in hotels at the Canadian tax payer’s expense. Also, they never anticipated the fact that third world peasants who’ve never had money before would not be able to manage all the “free money” the Canadian Government is giving them. They point out the example of how they’ll delve out $250 meant to be used for food to last for five days, and the peasants spend it all in only two days then come back begging for more.
D’uh. What did they expect?
Media outlet Tsecnetwork.com, another Canadian publication, recently ran an article pointing out that violence against women has become acceptable in Canada as long as it’s done within the Muslim community.
With Prime Minister Trudeau making such a disastrous decision to open his country’s flood gates to Muslim refugees, don’t be too surprised if after we finish building our wall on the border with Mexico, we start construction of a wall on our border with Canada.

"It’s been a bloody past couple of weeks thanks to the Muslim psychosacross the globe who continue to hack and massacre people in the name of their “peaceful” religion. As most are still in shock following what ISIS did to a group of Christians during a Palm Sunday celebration over the weekend when a bomb killed 27and injured 78 in Egypt, now a disgusting American Muslim is making her sentiments known about the attack, proving once again that there is NO SUCH THING as “moderate” Muslim as the leftis desperate for everyone to believe.
New York MuslimAyat Oraby was absolutely giddy over the news that Christians and toddlers had been ravaged with a bomb over the weekend, and took to social media where she was hardly able to contain her excitement. The hateful terrorist-supporting witch has a massive following of 1 million followers on facebook, and posted several videos of the attack in Egypt where her audience was equally as excited over the deaths of Christians as she was, celebrating in the comments with a plethora ofAlahu Akbars! on her posts.
But it gets even more disturbing. The woman then posted the following depraved rant to her followers, where shecalled the Christian Coptic church a “gang” that needs to be eradicated, saying that these Christians must “be made to understand that the (Islamic) crescent must be on top of the cross.” She went on to praise the tactics of the suicide bombers who killed toddlers during the attack, going on to call on her Muslim army of followersto murder even more Christians, as well as boycott the Copts.
This is the “moderate” Muslims we hear so much about. Yeah they’re not out there pulling the detonation cord to the suicide vests, but they’re just as deadly. It’s people just likeAyat Oraby who are constantly vocalizing their support of ISIS, while stirring up the hate among Muslims and motivating even more of these idiots to go out as “martyrs” for Allah, killing as many “infidels”as possible in the process.
This America, is who liberals want to infiltrate our country with. We are at war. Not only with these barbaric 6th century barbarians who will not stop killing until the world is bathed in the blood of the infidel, but againstall the liberal morons out there who will continue to fight for the “rights” of people who will continue to invade our country until something drastic is done.",1

"By now we figure it out that the media is the enemy of Trump. If there was something bad about him no matter true or false, the mainstream media would be all over it. The fact is, that mainstream media can’t show positive things about or from President Trump…they are completely biased for the ‘progressive’ liberal democrats and they don’t allow anything that doesn’t promote that narrative.
President Trump wanted to challenge this narrative with some facts and released a thirty-second ad marking his first 100 days in office. This way he wanted to remind the people of just how much he has accomplished to benefit the American people in his first 100 days.
But, as we though, the major networks – ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN refused to air an ad that labels them “fake news.”
In a statement on Tuesday, the Trump campaign’s executive director Michael Glassner said: “It is absolutely shameful to see the media blocking the positive message that President Trump is trying to share with the country,” In an email on Friday, the campaign said the blackout is “setting a chilling precedent against free speech rights.”
CNN was the first to refuse air the spot while claiming that the media do not cover his accomplishments.
In a statement given on Tuesday CNN said: “CNN requested that the advertiser removes the false graphic that the mainstream media is ‘fake news,’” “The mainstream media is not fake news, and therefore the ad is false and per policy will be accepted only if that graphic is deleted.”
NBC issued a similar statement on Friday: “Consistent with our policies, we have agreed to accept the ad if the inaccurate graphic — which refers to journalists as ‘fake news’ — is corrected.”
The “fake news” graphic appears over a split-screen showing NBC’s Andrea Mitchell, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and CBS’s Scott Pelley.
President Trump summed up the MSM’s decision to not air this ad perfectly:
“Apparently, the mainstream media are champions of the First Amendment only when it serves their own political views. Faced with an ad that doesn’t fit their biased narrative, CNN, ABC, CBS, and NBC have now all chosen to block our ad. This is an unprecedented act of censorship in America that should concern every freedom-loving citizen.”
Here we go again, more censorship of content that doesn’t fit their narrative. They are all offended because they know Trump is doing a great job. And they can’t even come close.
All media sources should be replaced from top to bottom. The news is there so we the people know what is going on in the world not just what they think we should know. These people are causing all the trouble.
I am looking forward to dumping the press on its head. It will be nice to see real news programs airing the truth.",1

He is based in the city of Brussels in Belgium. He was formerly a programme presenter and correspondent for BBC News, presenting the Liquid News programme on BBC News 24 channel (now BBC News Channel) and Entertainment Correspondent for the BBC Six O'Clock News (now BBC News at 6). He became urope Correspondent in September 2011. Robert was educated at Highgate School, then a boys' independent school, in the Highgate, London, followed by the University of Bristol, where he studied history. He then studied for a postgraduate degree in journalism at the Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies in Cardiff. Robert spent several years at the BBC, mainly as a correspondent for BBC News but also as chief reporter on BBC Choice's entertainment news show Liquid News.[2] It was Robert who discovered the body of presenter Christopher Price after he died from a rare brain infection in 2002.[3] Following the end of Liquid News, Robert went on to present The Morning Show, a shortlived daytime show on BBC One with the Pop Idol judge Nicki Chapman, in 2003,[4] but that was cancelled after poor viewing figures. Robert joined Sky News in January 2005 as a special correspondent and reported on Live at Five and the former show, The Sky Report, filming a series of undercover reports including one featuring the controversial Kansas preacher Fred Phelps.

"In Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, an elementary school has officially rejected the Dr. Seuss books First Lady Melania Trump sent the students as a gift from the White House. The librarian who sent the books back did so with fanfare, making sure to embarrass Melania with an open letter, spewing hate and venom. Well,Liz Phipps Soeiro just got some bad news as her sick secret was discovered. You don’t want to miss this.
Liz Phipps Soeiro is a mean-spiritedwoman who hates Melania Trump, even though she has never met her. When Liz received the Dr. Seuss books straight from Mrs. Trump for her students, she decided to make a name for herself as a true Trump-hater. She couldn’t just graciously accept them. No, she wanted to show off her “superior education.”
“Getting an education is perhaps the most important and wondrous opportunity of your young lives,” Trump said in a letter to the children who will be receiving books. According to CBS News, Liz the Librarian wrote back, “[M]y school doesn’t have a NEED for these books. And then there’s the matter of the books themselves. You may not be aware of this, but Dr. Seuss is a bit of a cliché, a tired and worn ambassador for children’s literature.”
She went on, “Another fact that many people are unaware of is that Dr. Seuss’s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes. Open one of his books (If I Ran a ZooorAnd to Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street, for example), and you’ll see the racist mockery in his art…Philip Nel’s new book,Was the Cat in the Hat Black? The Hidden Racism of Children’s Literature, and the Need for Diverse Books, further explores and shines a spotlight on the systemic racism and oppression in education and literature.”
It’s a long boring race-baiting letter, but those are the highlights. You get the picture, everything is about racism. But, Liz didn’t keep her comments between herself and the White House. No, Liz theLibrarian sent that letter out to news outlets, and then, she attempted to block potential reporters from looking at her social media accounts. I wonder why?
However, LizPhipps Soeiro forgot to block her “likes” on her Facebook page. She follows the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), Black Lives Matter,Islamic Society of Boston, andQueers Against Academic Hypocrisy, to name a few. People she follows includeStephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, Kamala Harris, and Micheal Moore. We could go on, but what’s the point? You can see the trend. Liz has an ax to grind as we learn from the language in her letter, and now, we know why.
@CBSNews & @book_bike She may not be aware, but this pic Liz Phipps Soeiro posted makes her out to be a hypocrite. pic.twitter.com/QmopdUBah8
But, it gets worse. We found a YouTube video of Liz the Librarian educating a group of teachers on how to make second graders “activists.” I only had to watch the first 1:43 of it, and she was already talking about race and civil rights issues that she thinks are appropriate for seven-year-olds. It was like watching a leftist training video. It’s truly pathetic and scary.
Well,LizPhipps Soeiro wanted her name in the news. She set out to rip on the first lady with her superior academic attitude. Those leftist academia snobs are some of the most obnoxious snowflakes out there. They use echo chambers to make themselves feel smarter than everyone else. Liz is about as smart as a box of rocks.
She is now outed for what she really is —one of those liberals in our education system who is screwing up young minds. I don’t know about you, but I read Dr. Seuss as a kid, and I didn’t turn out racist. Shame on Liz. Melania Trump sent you some books, it was your job to accept them graciously. Instead, you, like the NFL idiots, use your work time and your position as a forum to lecture the rest of us. Time for all these race-baiters to do their damn jobs, and if they can’t manage that, then fire them all.",1
"Tensions with North Korea over the past couple weeks have been incredibly strained following President Trump’s airstrikes in Syria. As Kim Jong un continues to rattle his sabers and spout off with threats about nuclear war, more of our forces continue to be deployed to the Korean peninsula as a show of force. Now breaking reports are coming in of a tragic event that just happened to one of our F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jets after a pilot attempted to land on the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vison, in the middle of the ocean.
Times of San Diego reports that as the pilot of the F-18 Super Hornet was attempting to land that something went horribly wrong as he was nearing the massive Naval vessel. He apparently lost control, and the jet crashed.  Narrowly missing his death, the pilot was thankfully able to eject where he was rapidly rescued by a nearby helicopter. So far, no major injuries have been reported.
A statement from the Commander of 7th Fleet Public Affairs read: “A pilot safely ejected and was quickly recovered by a helicopter assigned to HSC-4 aboard USS Carl Vinson while conducting routine flight operations during a transit in the Celebes Sea.”
“The incident occurred as the F/A-18E assigned to Carrier Air Wing 2 was on final approach to USS Carl Vinson,” the statement continued. “The incident is currently under investigation. The pilot is being assessed by the medical team on board USS Carl Vinson and there are no apparent injuries at this time.”
Times of San Diego reported:
The Navy said the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was in the Celebes Sea between Indonesia and the Philippines when the F/A-18E Super Hornet assigned to Carrier Air Wing 2 crashed. The plane was on final approach to landing at the time.
The Vinson and its strike group is headed to waters off the Korean peninsula after a training exercise with the Royal Australian Navy. The group’s deployment has been extended for 30 days amid rising tensions with communist North Korea.
The Navy said the pilot was being assessed by the medical team on board USS Carl Vinson but had suffered no apparent injuries. The crash is under investigation.

Conservative Tribune reported:
The Carl Vinson, which is based in San Diego, had been near Singapore a couple of weeks ago when it was reported to have been headed toward North Korea, but was later found to have first rendezvoused with elements of the Royal Australian Navy for a training exercise.
The incident occurred in the Celebes Sea, which is located between the Philippines and Indonesia, a good distance north of Australia but still a long way south of the Korean peninsula.
Thank God that our pilot was able to make it out alive. This just goes to prove what a highly-elite military we truly have. The pilot’s quick-thinking response from years of training no doubt came into play, as well as the fast reaction of a nearby rescue helicopter. Had this pilot been in the poorly-trained North Korean army whose military possess archaic equipment from the Soviet era, there’s no doubt this pilot would be a smoldering ember in the Korean peninsula at this point.

"LOS NGELES — La empresa Walt Disney Company recientemente sostuvo conversaciones preliminares para la adquisición de activos de entretenimiento que son propiedad de 21st Century Fox, lo que incluye al estudio de televisión y películas Fox, el canal por cable FX y una participación del sistema de emisión en línea Hulu.
Las negociaciones fueron reportadas primero por CNBC y confirmadas por dos personas que están al tanto y que hablaron bajo la condición de mantener su anonimato. Aunque las dos compaías ya no están en un diálogo activo al respecto, se cree que las discusiones podrían reiniciar. Los portavoces de ambas empresas no quisieron hacer comentarios.
Aunque fueron preliminares, el que hay habido estas conversaciones dice mucho sobre la rápida evolución de la industria de medios. Los gigantes, como Disney, buscan crecer a medida que siguen a Netflix al incursionar al negocio de transmisiones y emisiones en continuo y mientras se enfrentan a titanes tecnológicos como AT&T, que se encuentra en la etapa final para adquirir Time Warner.
Empresas de tamao mediano como 21st Century Fox pueden darse cuenta, o aceptar, que crecer a la escala que necesitan para poder competir está fuera de su alcance en este momento.
Las acciones de Disney subieron un 2 por ciento el lunes y la empresa tiene programado informar las ganancias del cuarto trimestre fiscal el jueves. Por su parte, las acciones de Fox subieron un 10 por ciento y la compaía también tiene previsto informar sus ganancias fiscales del primer trimestre esta semana.
Adquirir ciertos bienes de Fox tiene sentido empresarial para Disney, según analistas. El negocio robusto de producción televisiva de Fox podría ayudar a la empresa del ratón a apuntalar a los estudios ABC, que hace poco perdieron a una de las principales estrellas, Shonda Rhimes (de Scandal, Grey’s Anatomy y How to get away with murder), quien firmó un acuerdo con Netflix. Disney también necesita aumentar la producción televisiva para ofrecer contenido exclusivo en la plataforma que tiene planeada para emisión en continuo.
“La estrategia es que el contenido de Fox ayude a Disney a armar su estrategia de venta directa a los consumidores”, dijo Steven Cahall, analista de RBC Capital Markets.
Como parte de las conversaciones, Disney también analizó la compra de la participación minoritaria de Fox en Sky, el servicio de televisión paga con sede en el Reino Unido. Fox ha estado tratando de comprar todo Sky, pero hasta ahora ha sido obstaculizado por cuestiones regulatorias.
A Disney también le gustaría adquirir los derechos de las películas de Fox, más notablemente los de personajes como los X-Men y Los 4 Fantásticos, que fueron licenciados para Fox por Marvel Entertainment antes de que Disney comprara esa compaía de cómics y superhéroes en 2009.
Fox también controla la franquicia de Avatar; pero bajo un acuerdo de licencia, Disney abrió recientemente lujosas atracciones basadas en esa película en Walt Disney World.
En su último ao fiscal, que terminó el 30 de junio, 21st Century Fox tuvo 28,5 mil millones de dólares en ingresos, un aumento del 4 por ciento respecto al ao anterior, y 2,95 mil millones de dólares en ganancias atribuibles a los accionistas de Fox, que significa un aumento del 7 por ciento. Gran parte de esa ganancia provino de la unidad de televisión por cable de Fox, de la cual Fox News es el mayor contribuyente.",0
"Are you still eating sushi or any seafood from the Pacific Ocean? Well you might want to reconsider after reading this article. When it comes to environmental disasters, the nuclear fallout at Fukushima has to be amongst the worst that has happened in the past few decades. Andrew Kishner, founder of www.nuclearcrimes.orghas put together a great resource of information that tracks what has been developing over time in Fukushima as it relates to the nuclear incident. You can check out his research further using the links below.
The following is written by Gary Stamper in regards to what has been happening with Fukushima.
“The heart-breaking news from Fukushima continues to get worse -a lot worse. It is, quite simply, an out-of-control flow of death and destruction.
TEPCO is finally admitting that radiation has been leaking to the Pacific Ocean all along and it’s not showing signs of stopping just yet.
It now appears that anywhere from 300 to possibly over450 tonsof contaminated water that contains radioactive iodine, cesium, and strontium-89 and 90, is flooding into the Pacific Ocean from the Fukushima Daichi site everyday.
To give you an idea of how bad that actually is, Japanese experts estimate Fukushima’s fallout at 20-30 times as high as as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombings in 1945.
There’s a lot you’re not being told. Oh, the information is out there, but you have to dig pretty deep to find it, and you won’t find it on the corporate-owned evening news.”
LATEST: TEPCO says they believe 10 trillion becquerels of strontium-90 (and also 20 trillion becquerels of cesium-137) have leaked into the ocean from the crippled reactor complex since 5/11. (source). This is a ridiculously low estimate. Also, radioactive tritium levels in the sea (seaport) at Daiichi are creeping up and up and up (we knew that was gonna happen).
RECENT: In the latest mess at Fukushima, one or more of the hundreds of storage tanks at the nuclear complex holding EXTREMELY radioactive liquid waste are leaking. The radioactive liquid waste is flowing into the soil and standing puddles are ‘hot,’ measuring, at surface, about 10 Rem/Hr. Even taken out of context of the ongoing ‘level 7′ Fukushima nuclear disaster, these disastrous spills are considered BAD. As it turns out, the leak crisis has received a distinct crisis categorization, classed ‘a level 3′ on an eight point international scale (INES).
RECENT:Onsite contaminated water at Fukushima contains 3x the cesium released by Chernobyl",1
"A video went viral weeks ago, showing an entitled brat at the University of California, Riverside, who thought it was her right to take something that didn’t belong to her simply because she didn’t agree with it. Unfortunately for her, it seems that she most recently got slapped with the perfect dose of justice— and it’s safe to say that she isn’t laughing after hearing where she’s going.
As Mad World News Previously reported, a shocking clip spread like wildfire across social media after a woman, later identified as Edith Macias, decided to take a fellow student’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) hat. Come to find out, this man’s name was Matthew Vitale, and he wasn’t happy seeing how long it took to get his hat back, let alone the fact that someone snatched it directly off his head, to begin with.
As can be seen in the clip, the smug liberal was more than happy with taking something that belonged to someone else and wasting his time. Although she was initially stopped by campus security, her mentality would be validated when they let her go without consequence.
At the time, Vitale didn’t want to press charges – but that quickly changed. In addition, it was learned that Macias was so emboldened by her stunt that she decided to post the video on her own Facebook page in order to brag about what she did.
Too bad for her, that’s about the time things changed, and she doesn’t have anyone to blame up herself. Come to find out, her posting of the video allowed for her victim to press felony theft charges against the woman but it wasn’t immediately clear if he would.
Recent reports indicate that Vitale has finally decided to wipe the smug grin off the entitled brat’s face for good. In fact, The College Fix reports that she likely isn’t laughing anymore after hearing that she could be headed to jail for an entire year:
“A criminal complaint provided to The College Fix by the Riverside County District Attorney’s Office states that Edith Macias has been charged with one misdemeanor count of grand theft for the September 27 incident,”according toThe College Fix.
Macias could be facing up to a year in county jail, according to the report.
Charges were filed afterMatthew Vitale, the fellow student who was robbed, decided to pursue criminal theft charges. [Source: IJ Review]
As one would imagine, Vitale is especially pleased to hear that the District Attorney is moving forward with criminally prosecuting Macias. In fact, he has even gone so far as to issue a statement bashing the college for the reluctance to discipline the woman.
“I’m very pleased that the DA decided to charge her, especially because I am skeptical that UCR student conduct did anything. I will be following up with the student conduct office to determine if anything was done,” Vitale said. “In the meantime, I can’t thank UCPD enough for actually taking this matter seriously. The detective and officers involved with this case were the epitome of professionalism.”
He continued, “If, as I suspect, UCR decided not to discipline her in some way this decision by the DA’s office shows two things: First, that UCR does not protect and shows no respect for speech that does not conform to their ideology. Second, that, in this case, UCR chose not to discipline a person who committed a crime on campus against another student.”
At the end of the day, this is just one of countless attacks that happen to supporters of President Donald Trump. For some reason, it looks like assault and theft have not only become commonplace but actually acceptable in the eyes of the left, so long as it is carried out against the “right” people. However, it’s not okay, and brats like Macias are learning this the hard way. What they’re doing is still illegal – and if it takes you a year behind bars to learn your lesson, well, then so be it.",1
"NBC News announced Wednesday morning that longtime ""Today"" anchor Matt Lauer was fired after receiving a detailed claim of ""inappropriate sexual behavior"" lodged against him by a female colleague.
""Today"" co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, along with host Hoda Kotb, announced his departure at the beginning of the live show. Lauer did not immediately respond publicly to the announcement of his firing.
Guthrie: Good morning, everybody, welcome to ""Today."" And Hoda's here with me this morning because this is a sad morning here at ""Today"" and here at NBC News. Just moments ago NBC News Chairman Andy Lack sent the following note to our organization:
On Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer. It represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company's standards. As a result, we've decided to terminate his employment. While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he's been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident. Our highest priority is to create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected, and to ensure that any actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences, no matter who the offender.We are deeply saddened by this turn of events. But we will face it together as a news organization — and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.
That is the statement from our Chairman Andy Lack. And we just learned this moments ago just this morning.
As I'm sure you can imagine, we are devastated and we are still processing all of this. And I will tell you right now we do not know more than what I just shared with you, but we will be covering this story as reporters, as journalists. I'm sure we will be learning more details in the hours and days to come. And we promise we will share that with you.
And Hoda, for the moment, all we can say is that we are heartbroken. I'm heartbroken for Matt he is my dear, dear friend and my partner and he is beloved by many, many people here. And I'm heartbroken for the brave colleague who came forward to tell her story and any other women who have their own stories to tell.
And we are grappling with a dilemma that so many people have faced these past few weeks. How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly, and I don't know the answer to that. But I do know that this reckoning that so many organizations have been going through is important, it's long overdue and it must result in workplaces where all women — all people — feel safe and respected.
As painful as it is this moment in our culture, this change had to happen.
Kotb: Yeah, it did. This is a very tough morning for both of us.
I've known Matt for 15 years and I've loved him as a friend and a colleague and just like you were saying Savannah, it's hard to reconcile what we are hearing with the man who we know, who walks in this building every single day.
We were both woken up with the news kind of predawn, and we're trying to process it, and trying to make sense of it and it'll take some time for that.
Guthrie: Yeah, we're processing it with all of you at home. And we promise to be transparent and be straightforward.
Guthrie: And to continue this important conversation.
Guthrie: And there's no real way to do this, but this show has been on the air for more than 65 years and we're here because of you. We're supposed to bring you the news, and we're going to do that.",0
"Everyone has heard stories of suicides in the news. Some are plausible, while others– like a man who shot himself 7 times in the head with a nail gun to commit suicide – seem questionable. Recently, a string of alleged suicides have come in to question from many groups. It also seems that these particular “suicides” and their connection to NASA is something that has been very carefully kept out of the news. For instance, the man who committed suicide by shooting himself with a nail gun in the head many times has recently been a point of interest in the alternative news community.
Those crazy“Conspiracy Theorists”might even say it sounds like [the man who “shot himself with a nail gun 7 times] was tortured. Then there was the man found in the bathtub with his throat slit, the strange thing is that the knife was foundunderneathhim at death. Somewhat strange again no?
Have you heard about the man jumping off the 13th floor of a building after winning $10 million dollars? THAT one makes sense right? I’m sure the stress of which family members to help was just too burdensome. I’m being sarcastic. How many people do you know who’ve been run over on their morning jog? Would it surprise you to learn in some professional circles a morning jog can be quite hazardous to your health, resulting in instant death?
For those not familiar with these stories, I have published articles on every one of them, and many more. These are the VERY MYSTERIOUS deaths we’ve been seeing around the globe of high level bankers. I will detail my thoughts on that below and provide links to some of the banker deaths.
In the video below, you’ll learn that some of the stories conveniently escaping major media scrutiny right now are of the 74 NASA scientists mysteriously dying.
For all the skeptics out there, and for all those who are tired of these crazy“Conspiracy Theories,”let me ask you three questions.
1) Do you think there could POSSIBLY be a connection between the deaths of close to 200 men and women related to the highest levels of global banking, and the space agency tasked with watching the heavens?
2) Have their been ANY other stories out there (uh, ALL of them) that have been connecting the dots about what we are not being told?
3) Do you think the husbands, wives, and children of those 200 people think all this is coincidence?
Particularly the man who “shot himself” in the head 7 times with a nail gun?
Perhaps if all that sounds normal to you, no need to watch the video or read the article below. Wait until you hear about this new twist! Let me provide the full background first. I assure you, it will blow your mind.
I said the following in,Why Are The Illuminati Planning To Crash the Global Economy:
According to a CNN Money report, the United States lost roughly 23% of its TOTAL net worth in the financial crash of 2008. You might remember the crash?
The whole thing was Bush’s fault if you don’t remember. Obama says so.Anyway, keep in mind that figure includes the top 1% of Americans we hear so much about, so a more accurate number to base things on would be the total losses experienced by the “average” diversified stock portfolio.
Virtually EVERY person I know would have given a limb to have limited their losses to a mere 23%, so we really can’t count the uber rich with the rest of us.In 2008, the average diversified mutual fund lost close to 40% in value.
Almost HALF of the wealth of those “INVESTED” in American equities just evaporated. To wrap your head around how truly devastating the 2008 crash was, please let me remind you that it is by NO MEANS accurate to say the “average” family is heavily invested in diversified stock portfolios.
Most are in debt up to their eyeballs, living beyond their means, and surviving check-to-check. The “average” HOUSEHOLD income in 2008, for an entire working family, was only slightly over $50,000, soI think it’s safe to say, many of THOSE families were not making ANY investments into the “average” diversified stock portfolio.
MY POINT:MOST EVERY DAY PEOPLE LOST CLOSE TO 50% OR MORE OF THEIR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS OR MULTI-GENERATIONAL INHERITANCES IN 2008. SOUNDS BAD RIGHT?
TO PUT THE COMING FINANCIAL COLLAPSE INTO SOME PERSPECTIVE, THE CURRENT GLOBAL DERIVATIVE BUBBLE IS NOW 20% BIGGER THAN IT WAS IN 2008.
Many of us“Crazy Conspiracy Theorists”believe there are several reasons all the bankers keep dying, and it’s a safe bet that few, if any, have been actual suicides, which arehow many of the deaths been classified by police.
Fact:All the world’s money derives come from just a handful of wealthy family bloodlines, known in many cases as the“SECRET SOCIETIES”(see the links below).95% of the money on the planet’s belongs to 85 families, or something close to that.
Don’t quote me on that exactly, but it’s close. I know the 85 families is correct, but maybe it’s “only” 85% of the global moneyor something. Ether way, point made!Perhaps the most well known of these familiesto most people are the Rothschild’s, the Rockefellers, and the Carnegie’s.
Those families and their cartels have therun the world central banks just about forever, so theyare infinitely more powerful than most governments even. They are the ones most governments (Including the U. S.)crawl to when they need money. My point: don’t expect any of the“suicides”to be investigated as possible murders.

If you begin to research theissue of “banker suicides,” you’ll notice many of the bankers had things in common. Some even knew each other. Many worked on trading desks, or in some trading capacity, many held the same positions butatdifferent banks, or were upper upper level IT people with access to see the trades, positions, and/or transactions their banks had taken part in.None of the deaths are from low level employees.
Manu of the“suicides”were reasonably young (raising families), ultra successful, married, and with children… aka not “typical suicide cases.”All were in high level positions, and had access to the types of information they could draw obviousconclusions from depicting a very dark view into the future.
It’s likely many of the bankers were able to see trends or problems for their respective banks before the banks’ own boards even became aware. I suppose a few deaths MIGHT have been suicide. The rest probably tried to warn corporate officers, or worse they warned outsiders, and weresilenced to delay mass hysteria.
REMEMBER, THE CURRENT BUBBLE IS 20% LARGER THAN IN 2008!
IMAGINE IF THAT INFORMATION GOT OUT TO THE MASSES!!!
RIGHT NOW IS THE CALM BEFORE THE APOCALYPSE.
The world’s financial elite have been, and will continue toSCRAMBLE,in an effort to protect anything they can for what is coming. Once they are done, you’ll begin tosee the “connected” disappear as they go to their safe havens.
Have you SEEN some of theseBunkers in the Tens of Millions of Dollarsbeing built, and then flaunted right in front of people on television?
It’s sick how clueless the American people truly are. That’s just the private sector bunkers too. That’s not even includingHow the ElitesHave Arranged For Trillions of Our Tax Dollars to be Spent On Underground Bunkers For Them, Not You.
Below is a picture of one of the drills that has been digging these underground complexes since 1983. Is the enormity or the gravity of how serious this is hitting you yet? THIRTY YEARS they’ve been creating top secret underground bases across the globe in every developed country. What do they know that we don’t?
The size of the massive U. S. drill bit, when the drill backs out, creates a space largeenough for two 18-wheel tractor trailers to drive through side by side. That might sound impressive, however it’s important to note, elites ALL over the globe are doing the same.
That makes the notion that all this is a big “conspiracy” even more of an asinine statement. Anyway, OUR drill is NOT thelargest of its kind in the world. It’s secondonly to China though. Their’s is THREE TIMES as big. Can you imagine?
The elites are laughing in our faces, and especially at the people who blindlywatch the bunker showsinenvy over their lavish lifestyle. Instead, those moronsshould be putting 1+1 together, andfiguring out there is a reason for fear. How many people became wealthy enough to build multi-million dollar underground bunkers by WASTING their money? Need I say more? There have been BILLIONAIRE’S who have tried to warn us, but the ignorant still won’t listen:
WalMarts Around the Country Have Been Converted into to Prisons to be Used As FEMA CAMPS (AKA Concentration Camps), and they were built specifically for the very clueless fools watching the million dollar bunker shows. When the sh** eventually does hitthe fan, what’s left of the government doesn’t want THAT level of IDIOToutroaming around because they’ll either get killed themselves, or cause more trouble for others.
In the video below, the narrator begins by questioning the media narratives we’ve being told about a number of “alleged suicides.” Some have made the news, MANY have not, which only further adds to the suspicion of the stories.
The narrator begins with a man found after allegedly shooting himself SEVEN times in the head with a nail gun. Suicide? Really? Kind of an odd way to go isn’t it?
Those crazy “Conspiracy Theorists” might even say it sounds like he was tortured. Then there was the man found in the bathtub with his throat slit, the strange thing is that the knife was foundunderneathhim at death. Somewhat strange again no?

"After Sheriff Troy E. Nehls of Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office in Texas heard about a truck driving around with a “F*ck Trump” decal, he immediately set out to locate the person responsible. After seeking the help of social media, the department was able to locate the owner of the truck and gave her exactly what she deserved — but not for the reason you might be thinking.
It seems that people have forgotten what it means to show respect. Proving just that was Karen Fonseca, who has been driving around in her white pick-up truck with an offensive decal that says, “F*ck Trump and f*ck you for voting for him.” Although it’s unknown how long she’s been driving around with it, just recently, many motorists tipped off the local sheriff, complaining about the offensive decal.
As Mad World News previously reported, Sheriff Troy E. Nehls of Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office received several calls about the offensive message displayed on the truck. The Texas sheriff then set out to find the individual to whom the truck belonged and publicly stated that he would charge them with Disorderly Conduct. Lucky for him, after using social media, he was able to learn that the truck belonged to Karen Fonseca, who’s since been arrested – but not for the offensive message on her vehicle.
“I had just bought my soup and was going to go to the house,” she recalled, according to KHOU. However, that’s when an officer approached her. “I turn around and he says, ‘I’m not going to put handcuffs on you. I’ll follow you to your house, park your truck and come with us.'”
However, the woman immediately fired back with an excuse. “A warrant? I’ve been doing background checks recently, and they’ve all come out clear,” she stated. In fact, she later explained that she was certain she was stopped due to the decal on her truck, and she even went so far as to blame the cop who stopped her. “People abuse the badge, and in my opinion, money talks. When you’re in politics, people know how to work the system,” she rambled on— but boy was she wrong.
Come to find out, she was picked up for a reason totally unrelated to the nasty message on her vehicle. In fact, there has been an outstanding warrant for her arrest since August. What’s more, it’s just been released that she was wanted for fraud after she was charged withidentity theft that occurred in 2014. She has since been released from jail after her husband, Mike Fonseca, posted her $1500 bond.
Of course, the Trump-hating woman has stated that she’s keeping the decal for as long as she can. “There’s no law against freedom of speech, nothing in the law book here in Texas,” she said, according to CBS. “I’ve been stopped numerous times, but they can’t write me a ticket.”
Sadly, hateful liberals across the country have bombarded Sheriff Nehls and his family regarding the incident. Even though he didn’t actually charge her with disorderly conduct, somehow, people feel the need to attack him, saying that he was hindering her First Amendment right. Clearly, this woman has other problems besides the offensive sign against our President on her truck if there was a warrant out for her arrest for fraud.
I think it’s obvious why she doesn’t like President Donald Trump who promotes law and order. It’s abig change from former President Barack Obama who made excuses for criminals and encouraged hatred towards police officers.
Still, people seem to have blinders on and see only what they want about any situation. Up in arms about the sheriff’s remarks about disorderly conduct, even though she was never charged for that, somehow law enforcement is to blame for her recent arrest even though Karen was the one to commit fraud.
There are two distinct kinds of people in our country – people who take responsibility for their actions and people who don’t. If you want to drive a vehicle with a “F*ck Trump” decal, accept the fact that you’re drawing attention to yourself, and some of that attention won’t be positive. However, that doesn’t give you a free pass on your actual crimes. It’s time for people to realize that there are consequences for bad decisions.",1
"The nation was put in an all panic-mode this Monday when a shooting incident took place during a concert in Las Vegas. Labeled as the biggest shooting incident in American history, the shooter which was identified later as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, opened fire at the crowd of fans, ultimately taking the lives of at least 50 people and leaving more than 200 people injured, but it was CBS’ legal executive which caught everyone’s attention on Social Media.
Details later revealed that he was a part of the ISIS terrorist organizations, which claimed responsibility for the unfortunate event through a propaganda news channel. The gunfire was opened from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas late Sunday night.
However, what seems to have now grabbed the attention of the people and caused outrage among liberal and conservative supporters, was the top legal executive at CBS, Hayley Geftman-Gold, who stated that she “is not even sympathetic” for the victims of the shooting at a country music festival at Mandalay Bay.
In her post released on Facebook, Geftman-Gold wrote, “If they wouldn’t do anything when children were murdered I have no hope that Repugs will ever do the right thing,” adding how, “I’m actually not even sympathetic bc country music fans often are Republican gun toters.”
This isn’t the first time that CBS has showed hostility towards Republicans, as not long after the attack on GOP congressional baseball team, the network wrote that the shooting had been, “foreseeable, predictable and to some degree, self-inflicted.”
As of right now, no official response has been released by CBS.",1
"UPDATE: 7:45 pm PST, 1-30-17: Many news organization such as Fox & CNN reported that two suspects were arrested, and one was a Muslim from Morocco named Mohamed el Khadir. Khadir is now being labeled as a witness and is not charged. According to Fox News, Alexandre Bissonnette, a 27-year-old resident of Quebec, is the only suspect to be charged with murder at this time. Our original story is below.
UPDATE 12:52 am PST: The French language news site “TVA Nouvelles” based in Montreal, Canada has confirmed that one of the shooters is of “Arab origin.” The following was translated via Google Translate: “One of the two men arrested in connection with the terrorist attack in a Quebec mosque would be of Quebec origin and the other would be of Arab origin, according to information obtained by Félix Séguin from our Investigative Office.”
At least 6 people have been shot and killed at a mosque in Quebec City, Quebec. As soon as the news broke, liberal idiots began blaming Trump even though no motive is known, and anti-Muslim sentiment has been growing in the Canadian province for years before Trump was even on the political scene. The funny thing is, it’s now being reported by a witness that one of the shooters was shouting Allahu Akbar.
To add insult to injury, Fake News nazis over at The Daily Beast actually reported that two American white supremacists had been arrested and the “news” site published their names. There was just one problem, though. The names came from a fake Reuters Twitter account. It was all made up.
Conservative author & comedian Mark Dice called them out on it (See below for his Tweet).
“Two gunmen stormed an Islamic center in Quebec City and opened fire killing at least six people and wounded eight others Sunday, police said.
A police spokesman said that two arrests had been made in connection with the shooting. The number of injured victims was not immediately clear.
Le Soleil newspaper reported that one of the arrested suspects was 27 years old and had a “Quebecois name.” The paper also reported that one of the suspects possessed an AK-47.
Gunfire was reported at the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec at around 8 p.m. Le Journal de Quebec reported that approximately 40 people were attending the service.”
And Reuters reported that the problems started way before Trump was on the scene:
In June 2016, a pig’s head was left on the doorstep of the cultural centre.
Like France, Quebec has struggled at times to reconcile its secular identity with a rising Muslim population, many of them North African emigrants.
The face-covering, or niqab, became a big issue in the 2015 national Canadian election, especially in Quebec, where the vast majority of the population supported a ban on it at citizenship ceremonies.
Incidents of Islamophobia have increased in Quebec in recent years. In 2013, police investigated after a mosque in the Saguenay region of Quebec was splattered with what was believed to be pig blood.
In the neighboring province of Ontario, a mosque was set on fire in 2015, a day after an attack by gunmen and suicide bombers in Paris.
Que liberal outrage at Trump as if he were the cause of something that has been stewing under the surface for years (Some thought twice after Tweeting so we took screenshots).
Waiting for Trump to issue travel bans for ‘white supremacists’ to enter the United States. #RacistBan https://t.co/nA0dfSgdUj
And here’s the report from RT:
A witness told Radio Canada that one of the attackers shouted “Allahu akbar” as he opened fire.
“One started shooting. As soon as he opened fire he shouted, “Allahu akbar!” (“God is great!”) The bullets reached people who were praying. People who prayed lost their lives. As for myself, the bullet passed over my head,” the witness who refused to be identified said, adding the attackers “seemed to have a very good Québec accent.”
And here’s Mark Dice calling out the liberal scumbags at The Daily Beast who pretend to be the “Fake News Police” for falsely publishing that two white supremacists had been arrested.
.@TheDailyBeast published the ""names of the shooters"" from Quebec City mosque attack…names taken from a PARODY Reuters account! #FakeNews pic.twitter.com/76TiFU4MdB
FAKE NEWS ALERT! Daily Beast trolled into falsely accusing two American men of the Quebec mosque shooting. https://t.co/AD1z3r0i4t pic.twitter.com/eK9QKQ2rzd
At least there are some setting the lib idiots straight.
'People who were praying lost their lives': 5 killed in Quebec City mosque shooting https://t.co/2PBhH8YPWQ Not Trump's fault, Libtards!!
Watch for MSM to start blaming President Trump tomorrow. We’ll be calling out their fake news bs as it happens.

David Andelman: Recent arrests of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and others Saudis create a new challenge for Donald Trump
President will need to balance his friendship with Saudi King while advocating for US business interests and free expression
David A. Andelman, a contributor to CNN and columnist for USA Today, is the author of ""A Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today."" He formerly served as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times in Asia and Europe and Paris correspondent for CBS News. Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman. The views expressed in this commentary are his.
(CNN)Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, as I realized from the first visit I paid him nearly a decade ago, lives in a world unto itself. In his sprawling desert retreat outside the capital of Riyadh, satellite downlinks assure CNBC is visible as he welcomes guests to lavish feasts laid out on carpets scattered across the sands. Behind him in his well-appointed office is a wall of logos of the myriad companies, the bulk of them American-based, whose shares form the foundation of his vast wealth -- the largest in Saudi Arabia and at $18.7 billion, the 45th largest in the world, according to Forbes.
The prince, like many of his global counterparts, has pledged to donate his entire wealth to charity before he dies (he is now 62). But none of this -- not his generosity, his power, his friendships with the CEOs of the many companies where he is the largest or among the largest single shareholder, from Citibank to Twitter -- prevented him from being summarily seized Saturday night, along with at least 16 other princes and top officials. Each was charged with the vague and still unelaborated crime of ""corruption.""
It was a stunning, even shattering, move that speaks yet again to the unfettered power of the kingdom's ruling monarch and his tight-knit family. Above all, it is an enormous and direct challenge to Donald Trump, who has repeatedly proclaimed his deep affection for and alliance with King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud, and especially his son and heir-apparent, 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is believed to have been behind this weekend's roundup.
A resignation, detentions and missiles: 24 hours that shook the Middle East
While the Saudi kingdom maintains that the arrests are part of a larger investigation into corruption, it's hard not to wonder if Alwaleed's mouth -- rather than his financial transactions -- is to blame for his current predicament. The prince, who is more moderate than the ruling leaders, has challenged them on a variety of issues, including the ban on women driving (years before it was lifted).
The right to speak out in such a fashion has hardly been recognized broadly in Saudi Arabia, but should be the focus of Trump, who will have to balance his larger political and economic interests in Saudi Arabia -- including his latest push to have the monarchy list its oil company, Aramco, on the New York Stock Exchange -- with a broad defense of both free expression and a prince with strong business ties to the United States.

To complicate matters, Trump does not have the best relationship with Alwaleed. He has sparred with the prince, going back to when the prince and a group of investors bought New York's Plaza Hotel from Trump. The prince even went as far as to call Trump, in a 2015 tweet, ""a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America.""
The question is how long will it be before Citigroup Chairman Michael O'Neill, News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch, Disney's Michael Eisner, Apple's Tim Cook or Twitter's Jack Dorsey get on the phone to Trump and ask him to intercede with his great friend, the King?

Extremist funding over, says Saudi prince 09:13
Through the years, Alwaleed has developed close personal relationships with the leaders of many of these companies, particular Citigroup. Alwaleed is especially close to former Citigroup Chief Executive Sanford Weill, a relationship dating back to the 1990s when the prince began investing in Wall Street. And, as Alwaleed told me, he has come to the aid of several of these CEOs in boardroom battles. It's not unreasonable to assume they might now return the favor.
It's unlikely Alwaleed, who happens to be one of many nephews of the King, or any of his cellmates, will stand trial any time soon. While there is a court system and judiciary, the King sits at the top and has the final say in all cases. Moreover, in announcing the arrests, Saudi state media pointed out that charges were actually brought by a new anti-corruption committee, led by the crown prince, which is empowered to investigate, arrest, ban from travel or freeze the assets of anyone it unilaterally deems corrupt.
And how long before the House of Saud moves in to pillage Alwaleed's vast holdings? In the last year alone they have swung to a profit of 247.6 million riyals ($66 million) from a loss of 355 million riyals ($95 million) on a 76% rise in revenues. Meanwhile, Kingdom Holding's shares on the Riyadh stock exchange plunged as much as 9.9% in trading on Sunday (the first day of the business week on Islamic exchanges).
The crown prince and his father continue to insist that the new Saudi Arabia is a land of freedom and moderation, that the creation of the anti-corruption commission is merely a step toward the new look of Saudi Arabia. Already, they have brought an end to the historic ban on women driving, promulgated Vision 2030, which is designed to bring new jobs for the underemployed and overeducated who dominate the workforce. Last month, they even convened a vast ""Davos in the Desert"" investor conference with a glittering list of VIPs and live broadcasts from the convention floor by international media stars.

But can the royal family get out of its own way? Can the crown prince and his father withstand pressure for even greater changes from Saudi moderates like Alwaleed and restrain themselves from replacing veteran ministers with hand-picked cronies in the traditional Saudi royal fashion?
If Trump is sufficiently wise, and confident in his personal relationship with the King, he could serve as an important sounding board at what is clearly a crossroads for the oil-rich desert kingdom. He should examine how to make use of this relationship to press the broader values that America should stand for, including the reality of a rich and creative opposition. Such a Saudi Arabia could well be inoculated against forces of rebellion that have toppled so many of the kingdom's neighbors across the Middle East -- a good and reliable friend as well as a military ally.",0

Russia Begins Investigation Into American Media For Grave Violations Of Constitution
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
An interesting report released in the Kremlin today by the Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications (ROSKOMNADZOR) states  that it has been tasked by the State Duma (lower house of parliament) to join their investigation into the American mainstream medias apparent grave violations of Russian laws in the areas of propaganda and mass brain manipulation.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, ROSKOMNDZOR is authorized to investigate and refer for prosecution all foreign media outlets in the Federation believed to be in violation of the lawand which in this instance, nearly all of Americas mainstream media outlets are being accused by the State Duma of violating The Constitution of the Russian Federationspecifically:
Article 29
Section 2:  Propaganda or agitation, which arouses social, racial, national or religious hatred and hostility shall be prohibited. Propaganda of social, racial, national, religious or linguistic supremacy shall also be prohibited.
-and-
Section5: The freedom of the mass media shall be guaranteed. Censorship shall be prohibited.
The historical precedent for these constitutional protections for all Federation citizens against mass mainstream media propaganda and censorship indoctrination, this report explains, is based on the events after the 1917 Revolution when communist forces were able to plunge the entire nation into tyrannical leftist rule for nearly 70 yearsbut who would not have been able to accomplish their goals without mass media manipulation.
Commonly known as Lenins Theory of the Press (Soviet-Authoritarian Media Theory) named after the communist revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin, this report details, all media operations and functions are controlled by the state for the benefit of the state to serve the interests of the working classesand was so effective in mass indoctrination that it was adopted with capitalistic overtones by the fascist regimes of both Adolf Hitlers Nazi Party in Germany and Benito Mussolini in Italy.
In America today, this report continues, Lenins Theory of the Press has, once again, arisen in our worldbut using the fascist capitalistic model perfected by the Nazi Party where a bare handful of oligarchs control all media for the benefit of the stateand who, in return, are paid massive amounts of money and political favors by the state for their controlling the masses.
Following the 1980 election of President Ronald Reagan, who was opposed by the leftist-communistic forces in the United States, this report says, Lenins Theory of the Press was activated in America to the effect that where in 1983 90% of the mainstream media was owned by 50 companies of varying views and opinions, but by 2011, under the Obama regime, just 6 mammoth corporations controlled nearly all of the news in this countryleaving, in essence, just 232 media oligarchs controlling all of the information heard and seen by over 220 million Americans.
Critical to note of these 6 mammoth corporations controlling nearly all of the news and information seen and heard by the American people, this report continues, is that just like the Nazi Party model of Lenins Theory of the Press, they receive billions-of-dollars from the US government (mostly defense and intelligence funds) in return for their continuing to deceive the publicand includes the massive US government contracts given to The Walt Disney Company, the massive US government contracts given to Comcast, the massive US government contracts given to the News Corporation, the massive US government contracts given to Viacom, the massive US government contracts given to Time Warner, and the massive US government contracts given to CBS (through their Westinghouse division).
As to why the American people have never revolted against their own government for paying these 6 supposedly for profit media giants an estimated $7 trillion of taxpayer money over these past nearly 40 years to propagandize against them, this report notes, needs no explanation as these oligarchs, and their corrupt US government allies, have no interest whatsoever of allowing these people to know the truth.
Formed into what is now commonly known as the Deep State, this report continues, these 6 media giants and their US political class operatives are, in effect, a shadow government controlling the lives of all Americansbut who were recently defeated by President Donald Trump, and that whom they have gone to war against.
As to how President Trump was able to defeat his Deep State enemies, this report says, was by his bypassing these 6 media giants and talking directly to the American people through the largest social media campaign in historythus enabling the social media tracking company Medium to be one of the bare handful of anyone predicting his winning the presidency by their stating just prior to the 8 November 2016 election:  If the general election follows the same pattern as the primaries, the social media data collected indicates that Donald Trump [will] be the next President.
Want to know more?  Click HERE.
With the glaring and undeniable hostility by these 6 media giants and their Deep State allies against President Trump being evident by all, this report further notes, this mainstream media bias against him actually caused millions of American to seek other sources of newsand whose blatant propaganda against Trump became so obscene, even China, one of the most repressive news nations on Earth, was forced to slam this mass propaganda effort being used against the American people.
But to the greatest present danger being posed to the Federation by these 6 media giants and their Deep State allies, this report warns, is that their blatant and absurd fake news lies about Russia having gotten President Trump elected is now nearing total warand as evidenced this past when US Democratic Party Congressman Seth Moulton - a member of the House Armed Service Committee - told CNN that a nuclear war with Russia is a real possibility and that the US should prepare for it.
As to why this insane nuclear war warning was issued by this Democratic Party Congressman, this report explains, is due to these 6 media giants and their Deep State allies using Lenins Theory of the Press to plunge all of America into hysteriaand most commonly known in the United States as Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS), and that is even causing people to erect fearful billboards around the US warning that President Trump is preparing to kill them all.
Like the events following the 1917 Revolution when communists using Lenins Theory of the Press plunged all of Russia into mortal fear that Westerners aligned with Tsarist forces would destroy everything, and Adolph Hitlers Nazi Party, likewise, used it to plunge Germany into total fear that the Jews were destroying their nation too, this report continues, so too in America today are these 6 media giants and their Deep State allies preposterously convincing their citizens that Russia is now ready to destroy them.
To whom is actually controlling these 6 media giants fermenting revolution in the United States against President Trump, however, this report explains, is the Deep State aligned Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)whose direct control of every news organization in the West was exposed this past year by Udo Ulfkotte, a German journalist and former editor of Germany's prestigious newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, who publically admitted that all of the mainstream media was fake and said we all lie for the CIAbut whom, just prior to meeting with President Trump in January (2017), was assassinated.
As to why the American people are so susceptible to the propaganda emanating from these 6 media giants and their Deep State allies causing Trump Derangement Syndrome to sweep their nation, this report concludes, is due to the fact that nearly all of them have been deliberately turned into imbeciles by their US government leadersand that was shockingly revealed just months ago when an email of top Hillary Clinton operative Bill Ivey was released wherein he lamented the appeal of Trump while stating what they had shamefully done the citizens of their nation: And as Ive mentioned, weve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.  The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking

Final Battle For The World Begins: But Will Trumpian Forces Unite?
Return To Main Page",1
"The Taliban released a video Wednesday showing the moment former prisoner Bowe Bergdahl was handed over to American custody.
The 17-minute video, sent to NBC News by a known Taliban spokesman, shows both sides quickly shaking hands before a clean-shaven Bergdahl is handed over.
A misspelled message later flashes on the screen, bearing a warning: ""Don' come back to afghanistan.""
Pentagon spokesman RADM John Kirby told NBC News there was ""no reason to doubt the authenticity"" of the clip.
""U. S. officials are currently reviewing the video, but our focus right now is in getting Bergdahl the care he needs,"" Kirby said.
Staff Sgt. Bergdahl, who was held captive for five years, was released Saturday in exchange for five high-ranking Taliban militants held by the U. S. at Guantanamo Bay.
The swap was criticized by members of Congress who say that the Obama administration violated the law by failing to inform Congress of the move in advance. Some lawmakers say the decision to transfer Guantanamo detainees amounts to ""negotiating with terrorists.""
Bergdahl remains at the U. S. military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany undergoing physical and psychological treatment.
In the video released by the Taliban, Bergdahl is shown in white local dress, appearing to blink in the bright light.
As a helicopter comes in for a landing, Bergdahl is brought out of the truck to wait, standing and clutching a plastic bag. Armed men dot the hillside above him.
Bergdahl is then led by two escorts - one of them waving a white flag - to greet three other men who have emerged from the helicopter in what appears to be civilian clothing.
Quick handshakes are exchanged and Bergdahl is patted down. One of the soldier's new escorts flashes a thumbs up to the waiting helicopter, which has soldiers inside.
Bergdahl is frisked again, his plastic bag discarded, and he is then loaded into the chopper. The entire apparent transfer - from helicopter landing to take off - takes just over one minute.
The video was also distributed on social media.
In the video, a Taliban commander discusses how the transfer was arranged, saying that local tribal elders had been approached to help negotiate with the U. S. and select a location for the handoff that would guarantee security.
The Americans were informed about the 18 armed militants who would be present on the hilltops and had asked questions about Bergdahl’s health and even facial hair before the swap, the commander adds.
The commander also noted that the U. S. had requested that a green light be carried to the meet, but that it was difficult to find one so a white flag was used instead.",0

Mysterious Red Cow Comet Reappears
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
A melding of ancient prophecy and modern astrology appears to have been confirmed with the discovery of a heretofore unknown Comet within our Solar System, and as we can read as reported by Finlands Helsingin Sanomat News Service in their article titled ""Finnish star-gazer discovers meteor shower - fragments of new comet pinpointed"", and which says:
""Jarmo Moilanen, a municipal computer expert and amateur astronomer in the Finnish community of Vaala, has detected a new shower of meteors which originate from a hitherto unknown comet. Moilanens two monitoring cameras that he keeps pointed at the sky and linked to his computer, registered an unexpected meteor shower already in October last year.
The discovery was published in the Finnish astronomy magazine Thdet ja avaruus (""Stars and Space"") on Wednesday. The original discovery report was published in co-operation with Peter Jenniskens, who is considered one of the worlds leading authorities in the field.  The comet itself has not yet been pinpointed, but it is believed to have an orbit around the sun that is about 4,000 years long. It comes closest to Earth just inside this planets orbit, and is considered one of the five most potentially dangerous long-period comets for Earth in the long term.""
Though this new Comet may be unknown to modern astronomers, this does appear to be so for those of the ancient world, particularly the Jewish mystical tribe known as the Essenes, who in their writings prophesized that in the End Times the Comet of the Red Cow would return as a sign foretelling great upheavals upon our Earth.
In the ancient writings of the Essenes about the Red Cow Comet it was said it would appear from the Great Desert region of the sky, a reference to the Camelopardalis constellation which appears to have been unknown to the ancient astronomers and was not discovered until 1624.
Even more intriguing about the Red Cow Comet is its ancient name being associated with the Cattle belonging to the monster Geryon, and whom Heracles was tasked to returning in his tenth labor.  In ancient Egypt, also, was the Red Comet also both greatly feared and revered, even to the creation of many of these ancient peoples religious beliefs which lead to the worshiping and burying of the Apis bull in Memphis.
It must be remembered at this point our earlier discussions of the importance of cattle and their linking to our ancient human ancestors and the gods, and which modern researchers are beginning to rediscover, and as we can read as reported by the Science Daily News Service in their article titled ""Cattle, Human Genomes Contain Many Identical Genes"", and which says:
""The most detailed map ever produced of cattle genes and the first comparison map of cattle and human genomes show that many genes, and even whole chromosomes, are configured in the same way in the two species, scientists report.
Among the known genes, 638 (83 percent) could be identified as identical to human genes that also have positional information on human chromosomes, the researchers reported. Knowing the order of the same genes on the chromosomes of humans and cattle permitted the construction of the first ""whole-genome comparative map"" and revealed large regions of conservation of gene order in the two genomes. An examination of the comparative map revealed up to 149 conserved chromosome segments in humans and cattle, including four whole chromosomes that appear to have the same genes in both species, despite the two species being separated by more than 60 million years of evolution.
Among other firsts in the report were the identification of up to 48 novel genes, predicted mapping of 48 unmapped human genes on the basis of the cattle-map position, and the number of chromosome rearrangements during evolution resulting in the present organization of the cattle and human genomes.""
Remembered, too, should be the reverence held among the peoples of India about cattle: ""Cows are the mothers of all creatures. Cows are verily the mothers of the 33 crores of demigods that administrate creation in the material existence throughout all the universes.
Cows are the goddesses of the gods and the refuge of all auspiciousness. Cows bestow every kind of happiness and for these reason they always are worshippable. Cows are the support of all the worlds for by their milk they nourish terrestrials beings and by their ghee offered in sacrifice they nourish the denziens of the celestial realms.""
But more important to the gods then the ghee, a type of butter given to them in worship, were the sexual reproductive organs of cattle, and which when ground down into a powder and ingested by these gods allowed them to adapt to our Earths atmosphere, plants and water.
So great was need of these ancient gods to cattle for being able to live upon our Earth that almost all human tribes were required to both raise and sacrifice cattle for these ancient monsters.  The reappearance of these ancient gods into our World today, and their needing Earths cattle again for acclimating themselves to our Planet, is suggested by the many reports, from all around the World, of unexplained cattle mutilations, and where only those sexual parts once presented by our ancient ancestors to these monster gods as sacrifices are once again being taken.
But, to the greatest significance of our Human Race by the returning of the Red Cow Comet, and the gods whom it represents, can be found in the ancient writings of the Israelites:
""At that time the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he went throughout the land of Gilead and Manasseh, including Mizpah in Gilead, and led an army against the Ammonites.  And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD. He said, ""If you give me victory over the Ammonites, I will give to the LORD the first thing coming out of my house to greet me when I return in triumph.  I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.""
""So Jephthah led his army against the Ammonites, and the LORD gave him victory.  He thoroughly defeated the Ammonites from Aroer to an area near Minnith  twenty towns  and as far away as Abel-keramim. Thus Israel subdued the Ammonites.
When Jephthah returned home to Mizpah, his daughter  his only child  ran out to meet him, playing on a tambourine and dancing for joy.  When he saw her, he tore his clothes in anguish.  ""My daughter!"" he cried out.  ""My heart is breaking!  What a tragedy that you came out to greet me. For I have made a vow to the LORD and cannot take it back.""
And she said, ""Father, you have made a promise to the LORD.  You must do to me what you have promised, for the LORD has given you a great victory over your enemies, the Ammonites.  But first let me go up and roam in the hills and weep with my friends for two months, because I will die a virgin.""
""You may go,"" Jephthah said. And he let her go away for two months.  She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never have children.  When she returned home, her father kept his vow, and she died a virgin."" Judges 11:29-40
To the barbaric cruelty of the gods relishing in the burning to death of a young girl child by her own father is not just a testament of their ancient ways, but is more importantly a sign of what our World has become once again.a Planet ruled by Evil Monsters intent upon the total destruction of all human beings.

Just over a week ago, he opened a dumpling restaurant in anticipation of the crowds. He hopes to start a franchise. “This is branch number one,” Cho said while attending to several steaming trays. However, the 32-year-old is careful not to be too optimistic. He suspects the Games may have been overhyped in South Korea. “The general expectations are so high,” he said. “I don’t want to be disappointed.”   South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon and a torch bearer, South Korean figure skater You Young, hold the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic torch Nov. 1 in Incheon, South Korea. (Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images)  Cho is not the only one with concerns. For all the excitement, there are worrying signs that the PyeongChang Games are running into trouble. Ticket sales have been low — 35percent of what was hoped for at this point. And a large amount of work needs to be done. These concerns are not unusual for an Olympic host. But the PyeongChang Games also have a more unique issue: a nuclear-weapons-minded North Korea that sits about 50miles from the Olympic venues. When South Korea won the contest to host the 2018 Winter Olympics seven years ago, the North Korea factor looked like little more than an inconvenience. There was even serious talk of South Korea co-hosting the event with North Korea as a sign of goodwill. Now, with just weeks to go until the event, North Korea could be a major problem for the PyeongChang Games. The North has made significant progress with weapons programs in recent months, testing missiles and conducting a huge underground nuclear bomb test in September despite international condemnation. The circumstances have sparked some alarming talk among Olympic officials. In September, the French sports minister suggested that the country would keep its athletes at home if their safety could not be assured. Last month, a British official told the BBC that the country had an evacuation plan for the Games and that “welfare” officers would be traveling with the athletes to “make sure that they feel entirely content.” The North Korea issue also comes alongside other big problems that are unique to the PyeongChang Games, including the political scandal that led to this year’s impeachment of South Korea’s previous president and a diplomatic spat with China over the deployment of a U. S.-made missile defense system. Worse still, the issues may affect not only the Olympics but tourism as a whole. The country’s central bank announced Sunday that the number of foreign visitors to South Korea plunged by almost a quarter in the first nine months of the year compared with 2016. It is a worrying combination for organizers. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has tried to calm nerves, telling reporters at a New York event in September that “a successful hosting of the PyeongChang Games would erase worries over security and show the world regional peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.” Olympic organizers have tried their best to reassure potential visitors and take their minds off the threat from North Korea — even adding a capitalized “C” to the county’s Romanized name so it is not mistaken for the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. They have held a number of Kpop-filled events this week to mark 100 days until the event, hoping to get potential ticket buyers interested. But the situation is complex: In order to be reassuring, organizers often have to remind people of the very threat they want them to forget. Choi Moon-soon, governor of Gangwon province, which includes PyeongChang, has told the local news media that the worries could lead to the Games becoming a “global humiliation” for South Korea. Some suggest that the risk of conflict with North Korea is overhyped. “People outside Korea are concerned about the North Korean threat, but there have been threats for many decades,” said Lee Kean-hee, 34, who runs a shop opposite the Olympic Stadium that sells the local specialty of dried pollock fish. “Koreans living here are not so concerned, so you don’t need to be, either.” North Korea has made things difficult before for South Korea ahead of sporting events. A year before the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, North Korean agents bombed a Korean Air flight, killing everyone on board. And during the 2002 World Cup, a North Korean warship opened fire on a South Korean patrol boat, leaving six soldiers dead. However, experts say that any attack at the Games is unlikely. “I think the Olympics will be safe,” said Robert E. Kelly, an expert on North Korean security issues at Pusan National University. Notably, two North Korean athletes — figure skaters Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik — have qualified for the Games, and many hope they will serve as an insurance policy against
any provocations. Sim Jae-kook, mayor of PyeongChang county, said that although it is unclear whether North Korea will participate in the Games, it has said it will send a team to the PyeongChang Paralympics, which begin soon after. Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, a Seoul think tank, said that he did not expect any provocative actions during the Games but that North Korea may stage a missile test or atmospheric nuclear test in the coming months. “Unfortunately, South Korean Olympic organizers cannot do much to prevent such things from happening,” Choi said. Even if North Korea does not end up taking such a step, the Games could still be harmed by the impression it might do so. “I’m not surprised the ticket sales are low,” Pusan’s Kelly said. “North Korea generates a lot of unnecessary hysteria in the West.” Sim, the mayor, noted that officials need to be prepared not only for North Korea but also for terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and disasters both natural and “artificial.” “There will be a lot of soldiers everywhere — even up in the mountains — so we will be prepared perfectly,” Sim said. But local officials are aware that they are in a race to finish the preparations. “By this time, it’d be natural for all the venues and infrastructures to be complete,” said Lee Sung-han, chief secretary of PyeongChang county. In some areas, she said, people “might even wonder if this is the location for the Winter Olympics.” For all the delays and uncertainty, Sim noted that a vast number of new roads have been built in this poor, rural county, and a high-speed train connection to Seoul is due to open within two months. At an event in Seoul to promote the Games on Wednesday, many South Koreans said that they were hoping to attend the Olympics but had not yet bought tickets. “The mood will pick up,” said Yeo Hee-sung, a 60-year-old retired civil servant. “South Koreans can get excited in a very short amount of time,” he noted, before pausing. “They can also cool down in a very short amount of time.”      After six tests, the mountain hosting North Korea’s nuclear blasts may be exhausted   She was South Korea’s superstar ballerina.

"Social media across Saudi Arabia and the Arab world has been focused on a bizarre news story, namely involving a prince named ‘Adel Al-Otaibi’, and his alleged exploits involving a most un-halal food type: bacon.
According to reports on several news websites, the prince was busted after Israeli authorities caught him “trying to smuggle over 2,000 kilos of undeclared various pig meat products.”
The 2,000 kilos of processed meat originally declared as “veal meat” were found to be suspicious by local authorities who eventually realized the meat was in fact pig meat, a delicacy which is under heavy scrutiny by the country’s laws and that makes pig farming a crime in most regions of Israel except for a minority of Christian Arab communities that are allowed by law to raise the farm animals.
The reports go on to explain:
Saudi authorities have not taken to the news kindly as Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Adel Al Jubeir, has accused Israel of “framing a member of the royal family” in a disloyal attempt to “attack the reputation of the royal Saudi family”and is asking for the immediate release of PrinceAdel Al-Otaibi and his 17 body guards.
If you haven’t already figured out it’s a fake news story, the next paragraph confirms it:
PrinceAdel Al-Otaibi, who is renown for his outlandish ways and extravagant parties, made international headlines last year after rumors spread on social media that he had offered $1 million dollars to Kim Kardashian for an evening with the celebrity. Although Kim Kardashian never publicly confirmed the rumor, she was spotted atRiyadh King Khalid International Airport weeks later by paparazzis.
Verdict: This story is a complete fabrication by various fake news websites. There’s no such person as PrinceAdel Al-Otaibi, and even if there was, there’s no way anybody would be stupid enough to try and smuggle bacon into Israel.",1

"For those who are inexperienced or out of practice in comforting someone in grief, what are some tips for mastering (or at least not humiliating yourself in) the lost art of condolence?
1. BEING TONGUE-TIED IS O. K. When I solicited advice from friends on social media, the one overwhelming thing I heard was it’s perfectly acceptable to admit you don’t know what to say. One rabbi said, “Admitting you’re at a loss for words is far more caring and helpful than writing pithy statements like ‘he’s in a better place’ or ‘your child was so perfect, God wanted her to sit beside him.’”
Chanel Reynolds’s 43-year-old husband was killed in a biking accident, leaving her a single mother of their 5-year-old son. Ms. Reynolds was so destabilized she started a website now called GYST.com, shorthand for the off-color version of “Get Your Stuff Together.” Her advice: “Zero platitudes. If you’re feeling the urge to panic-talk and fill the air with clichés, don’t.”
She singled out two expressions that particularly grated. The first was, “At least he died doing what he loved.”
“Getting hit and run over by a van was not his love,” she said. “Riding a bike was.”
The other expression, “At least you weren’t married for so long that you can’t live without him.”
“Thank God we were only married for nine years,” she said dryly. “Dodged a bullet there.”
2. SHARE A POSITIVE MEMORY Instead of falling back on a shopworn phrase, savvy condolers often share a warm or uplifting memory of the deceased.
Kevin Young is a poet and creative writing professor at Emory University whose father died more than a decade ago. He channeled his grief into words, first publishing an anthology of poems about mourning called “The Art of Losing” and later a collection of his own work on the subject called “Book of Hours.”
The condolence notes that moved him most, he said, were from strangers who shared a recollection of his father. “That was important for me because I realized his place in the world,” he said. “At the time, you’re only thinking of your own relation to the loved one. You realize this person had impact beyond you. That was comforting.”
3. NO COMPARISONS One bit of quicksand worth avoiding is the temptation to say you know what the other person is going through. Everyone experiences grief differently. While you may have felt angry or overwhelmed when your loved one died, the person you’re writing to may have channeled her grief into work or hyper-efficient house purging.
“The temptation is to bring it back to yourself, but this is not about you,” Ms. Reynolds said. “I heard things like, ‘I was at my friend’s house when I heard,’ ‘I couldn’t sleep all night long,’ ‘I cried so hard.’ Really? Because I think I’m sadder.” A better approach, she said, is to be neutral. “You can absolutely express your sadness and sorrow,” she said, “but remove yourself from the conversation.”
4. DON’T DODGE THE ‘D’ WORDS Death in our culture has become so sanitized, we have become afraid to mention it by name. While this instinct may come from a good place, it often lands in a bad one, the treacly territory of euphemism and happy talk. Loved ones don’t “die” anymore; they’re “carried away” or “resting peacefully.”
“When did people become so squeamish,” one friend griped. “All the euphemisms make my skin crawl.”
To avoid this tendency, consider following the lead of the police support website officer.com, which advises law enforcement officials doing death notification to use “simple, straightforward language.”
“Don’t’ be afraid to use the ‘D’ words — dead, died or death. Terms such as ‘expired,’ ‘passed on’ or ‘lost’ are words of denial. ‘Expired’ can be used on a driver’s license but not in person — it’s not respectful.”
5. GET REAL. By contrast, grievers hear so many vacuous phrases that a little straight talk can often be a welcome relief. A little bluntness goes a long way.
The food writer and editor Jane Lear has collected etiquette books for many years and studied how condolence notes have evolved. She prefers the model outlined by Millicent Fenwick in “Vogue’s Book of Etiquette,” published in 1948. First an expression of sympathy (“I was so sorry to hear...”). Second a word about the deceased. Finally an expression of comfort.
“This all makes perfect sense,” she said, “but I think my favorite note upon the death of my brother was from one of my closest friends. ‘My dear Jane,’ he wrote. ‘IT STINKS.’”
6. FACEBOOK IS NOT ENOUGH These days many people first learn of the death of a friend’s loved one via social media. The instinct to post a comment or dash off an email is understandable.
But everyone I spoke with agreed on one point: Even heartfelt gestures like these do not replace a condolence note. A stern reminder from Ms. Fenwick still seems apt: “A letter of condolence to a friend is one of the obligations of friendship.”
The current iteration of Emily Post, emilypost.com, agrees, saying that commenting in public forums or sending an email is an acceptable first gesture, as long as you follow “with a handwritten note and, whenever possible, attendance at the funeral or visitation.”
7. THERE’S NO TIME LIMIT ON SYMPATHY While writing immediately is comforting, it’s not necessary. Many mourners are overwhelmed in the immediate aftermath, and a number told me they especially appreciated cards that arrived weeks or even months after the death.
One friend told me, “I personally back off from doing anything right away and offer to take the griever out for lunch, coffee or dinner a month or so later when everyone has returned to their lives and the person is left alone to deal with the pieces.”
Ms. Reynolds said: “Even three or four months later, touching base can help. I would encourage people to send notes on the deceased’s birthday, on the couple’s anniversary, or some other meaningful occasion.”
Even with these tips, many people may still feel daunted with the pressure to come up with the right words. In that case, send someone else’s words. Mr. Young recommended three poems: “Clearances” by Seamus Heaney, “Funeral Blues” by W. H. Auden or “Infirm” by Gwendolyn Brooks.
Or, do something: Take the deceased’s pet for a walk, run an errand, offer to pick up a relative from the airport.
Or, fall back on what loving supporters have been doing for generations: Send food, even if it’s by mail. Citing his own experience, Mr. Young said: “Cookies are great. You’ve got to eat.”

"One of the women who reached a silent settlement with Bill O'Reilly over harassment charges sued the fallen pundit and his former employer, Fox News, on Monday for defamation and breach of contract.
The woman, Rachel Witlieb Bernstein, claims that O'Reilly and Fox News violated the terms of the settlement they reached in 2002 by making public statements that depicted her as a liar and an extortionist.
""In fact, Mr. O'Reilly is the liar,"" according to the lawsuit, which was filed in federal District Court in Manhattan. ""He mistreated Ms. Bernstein. She was forced out of her job at Fox News and paid a settlement because of the mistreatment.""
Bernstein did not allege she was a victim of sexual harassment in the lawsuit. The New York Times, which first reported the suit, said she is part of a group of six women who made settlements with the host.
In the lawsuit, Bernstein said remarks that both O'Reilly and Fox News made in response to a New York Times article in April about how the network protected O'Reilly violated the terms of the confidentiality agreement that all sides agreed on.
""O'Reilly portrayed himself as a 'target' and claimed the complaints against him were extortionate,"" the suit read. ""This is false. In fact, he is a serial abuser and Ms. Bernstein's complaints about him were far from extortionate.""
The April article detailed numerous settlements by O'Reilly. Bernstein alleges that Fox News, through its parent company, 21st Century Fox, falsely told The Times that it had received no complaints to an anonymous company hotline because, she contends, there wasn't a hotline while she was employed there in 2002. She also says she made repeated complaints in person to the network's human resources department and to other senior Fox News executives.
A lawyer for Ms. Bernstein, Neil Mullin, asked that O'Reilly and Fox release all victims from their nondisclosure agreements in order to ""let the truth out."" Mullin's law firm, Smith Mullin, also represented former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, who alleged she was harassed by the late Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes.
O'Reilly has paid out more than $45 million to settle claims against him, according to The Times. In October, The Times also reported that the anchor had paid a $32 million settlement to Lis Wiehl, a former federal prosecutor and a legal analyst at the network. She accused him of forcing her into a ""nonconsensual relationship.""
O'Reilly made several statements to other media outlets, telling The Hollywood Reporter that ""no one was mistreated on my watch,"" which portrayed the plaintiff as a liar, the suit alleges.
He was dropped from the network after the harassment allegations began mounting, and advertisers began exiting his show. He said in October he regretted settling sex harassment cases.
Fox News did not immediately return an email for comment. Frederic Newman, an attorney for O'Reilly, denied in a statement that his client has ever mentioned Bernstein publicly.
""And as the original New York Times story makes clear, this was absolutely not a case of sexual harassment. So today's lawsuit has absolutely no merit, and Mr. O’Reilly will respond aggressively in court,"" Newman said.
CORRECTION (Dec. 4, 2017, 5:07 p.m.): A previous version of the headline on this article referred incorrectly to the nature of the Bernstein case. The case involved charges of harassment, not sex harassment.",0

WATCH – MUSLIM SAYS IT’S OKAY TO SLEEP WITH 9-YEAR-OLD GIRL FOR THIS SICK REASON
The radical Muslim way of life continues to permeate throughout the West, but don’t count on liberals to speak about it. they’re too concerned with supposed Islamophobia.
However, we want to be concerned about the disgustful cultural norms radical Muslims intend to bring to our country. as an example, a bunch of Muslims was caught on tape in Toronto claiming it’s okay to make love a nine-year-old girl just because she is “considered an adult.”
I don’t care what Muhammad thought was appropriate — there’s no sharia law in Canada! And it’s definitely not in the united states either.
In this country, we’ve got another term for sleeping with a nine-year-old. there’s nothing “consensual” about it—we call it kid rape.
Nine-year-old girls don’t seem to be prepared for the emotional burden it takes to be involved in a sexual relationship. that’s why they’re unable to give consent. And this, my friends, is simply one of the several reasons why we must always have a thorough vetting process for Muslims who come to the united states from countries that bow to sharia law.
If any of the men during this video tried to sleep with a young girl here in the united states, they would right away be in a world of hurt. Obviously, the girl’s parents would be seeing red. they might be found and charged by authorities, amid much outrage by the public.
After the justice system had run its course, any of those men, who insist sharia law is the way to go, would be sentenced by our laws as they must be.
These men would be registered as sex offenders. they might have their names plastered everywhere the net, and they would have trouble renting residences or finding work. And that’s IF they didn’t get a long jail sentence.
In these situations, if the offending male or males are white, there’s appropriately fueled outrage, however the second it’s revealed the unofficial sex offender is Muslim, something else happens altogether. Specifically, lots of liberals quiet right down.
Unless, of course, somebody dares to condemn him for his “religious beliefs.” Liberals would right away label such someone a bigot. just as they have done with Donald Trump.
The united states and Canada cannot afford to be fundamentally changed in this manner. we cannot afford to have a section of the population who believes their own religious laws supersede the laws of the nation. Anyone who says it’s okay to sleep with a young girl desires his head examined!

The Monmouth University poll, published Wednesday, found that Republicans (79 percent) were most likely to say that major news outlets transmit fake news stories, compared to 66 percent of Independents and 43 percent of Democrats.
Of those, Republicans were also more likely to say that major news sources reportedfake news deliberately, rather than by mistake or due to poor fact checking.
The survey found that even more people distrust online news websites, with a whopping 80 percent believing such outlets report fake news regularly or occasionally.
The three groups of respondents were more equally aligned on the topic of whether online news outlets reportfake news deliberately, with Republicans and Independents tied at 57 percent. Democrats weren’t far behind, at 52 percent.
US President Donald Trump has long lambasted mainstream media for reporting“fake news,” opting to communicate to Americans directly through Twitter and allowing local news stations to take part in daily press briefings, in an effort to bypass national networks.
At his inauguration ball in January, Trump asked the crowd whether he should keep tweeting once he moved into the White House, ultimately deciding that he would.
“Enemies keep saying, ‘Oh, that’s terrible.’ But you know, it’s a way of bypassing the dishonest media, right?” he said at the time.
Trump’s relationship with the media was reflected in the Monmouth poll, with 81 percent of respondents stating that he has a worse relationship with the media than past presidents. The majority (58 percent) said the bad relationship has hurt Trump’s image.
However, Trump isn’t the only one suffering from his feud with mainstream media – just over half of those surveyed (51 percent) said the bad blood between the two sides has also hurt the media’s image.",1

Today’s infographic fromSafe Companyis athrowback to the 1980s and 1990s, making us nostalgic for the heyday of these popular gadgets.
The gadgets of the 80s and 90s were all about taking existing technology and making it more enjoyable while on the go, rather than solely being useful in the home or office.Even if that meant devices that were “portable” in name only, it was a huge step forward.
Devices like the Game Boy, Walkman, early Nokia phones, and other mobile technologies helped lead engineers to solve the problems that would lay the ground for today’s “world in the palm of your hand”. Improving power consumption efficiency, developing new battery types, reducing size, creating screens that were readable in a variety of light conditions, and even opening up the demand for aftermarket accessories were among these advancements.
The latter 20th century will be remembered for democratizing access to all kinds of information, both for work and for play. Technologies of the 90s set a precedent for the bite-sized span of modern digital attention. Microsoft’s Encarta encyclopedia suite allowed comprehensive keyword search before the optimization of online alternatives. Simply type a word, and get every piece of information related to it – without the need to purchase updated versions including new data each year. It sounds almost comical to tout these as features in the age of Google, but compare Encarta to the alternative: carrying around a set of Encyclopedias!

The ever beeping, cutesy reward loop of caring for your Tamagotchi may have annoyed a generation of parents, but it inspired a whole genre of bite-size digital entertainment.
Even the Walkman launched a new frontier of access to media through the creative possibilities of mixtape-making, bootlegging, and sharing tapes. I’m sure anyone who grew up in the 80s and 90s had a shoebox full of favorite tracks taped from radio and vinyl… or was that just me?
Though it is easy to downplay the quaint technologies that came nearly thirty years ago, we can’t ignore that its influence is in the DNA of the devices and digital interactions we encounter every day.Go back through your closets, dig out your Game Boy, and take a trip back in time to remember the curiosities and comforts of old-school tech!

"Senate investigators are seeking records from a former Trump campaign adviser dating back to 2010, ahead of a planned closed-door interview as part of the Russia meddling investigation.
The interview with Carter Page is one of 25 additional interviews being lined up for the Senate Intelligence Committee, whose leaders made clear in a statement to the press earlier this week that their investigation will go on.
In an Oct. 4 letter reviewed by Fox News, the committee asked Page for any records documenting communications or contacts with Russians going back seven years.
Page, a former foreign policy adviser to then-candidate Trump, wrote back to the panel voicing concern about the possibility for “entrapment,” claiming the request “virtually insures some level of false testimony.” He likened the request for documents to a computer strip-search.
“What we are dealing [with] is an adversarial part of the law,” Page, who is representing himself legally, told Fox News on Thursday.
While the committee is looking for evidence of Russian contacts, the ex-adviser continues to insist he was targeted by members of the Obama administration via an illegal FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) warrant in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.
Page also insists that allegations made about his ties to Russian officials in a now-infamous anti-Trump dossier are false.
The dossier was authored by former MI-6 British intelligence officer Christopher Steele under contract with the U. S.-based Fusion GPS firm.
Page, who is managing partner of Global Energy Capital LLC, called the investigation a “14-month witch hunt,” saying, “I am not intimidated.”
Several federal investigations, including the one led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, are ongoing into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
Efforts to compel Steele to appear before any committee have failed thus far, including an August 2017 trip to London made by Senate staffers. However, CNN reported Thursday that Mueller’s investigators were able to meet over the summer with Steele. In an email to Fox News on Friday, the press office for the special counsel declined to comment on the Steele story.
During a joint news conference this week, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N. C., and Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., updated the public on the committee’s investigation.
“It’s safe to say the inquiry has expanded slightly.Initial interviews and document review generated hundreds of additional requests on our part for information,” Burr said.
He said the panel has conducted more than 100 interviews lasting more than 250 hours in its nine-month probe.But the chairman acknowledged the committee is still probing any possible collusion between Trump associates and the Russians.
The Senate Intelligence Committee has given Page until Oct. 18 to comply with its request.",0
"Historically, people have not needed to know how the news media produced their product to use its output, any more than they needed to know how to build an internal combustion engine to drive a car. It was sufficient to trust that those who knew how did their jobs properly.
At least as far as the news is concerned, this is no longer true. The media has become so fragmented that people need to know more than they used to about the nuts and bolts of news gathering to judge whether a source is trustworthy or not.
Cable shows that are essentially propaganda look a lot like those that are responsible news programs, irresponsible internet publications programmed to deceive are hard to distinguish, at least on the surface, from those trying their best to deliver the truth.

It’s hard even for seasoned professionals. It’s common to hear about Internet hoaxes and satire being reported as legitimate news. Journalists who use Twitter are especially prone to post first, ask questions later, when a hot story breaks that has superficial plausibility.
It’s toughto discipline oneself to read a tweet before hitting the “send” button. As we know all too well, even the president of the United States often tweets statements he apparently hasn’t bothered to proofread — remember “covfefe”?
Compounding this problem is the fact that clicks translate directly into money for news sources, and the first to post a hot news item often gets the lion’s share of the clicks. Those responsible enough to double check and confirm an item that sounds a little too good to be true often lose out to their less responsible competitors.
Worse, a click’s value is the same to an advertiser if the story is true or one made up out of whole cloth. Thus there tends to be a race to the bottom, where lies and gross exaggerations displace truth and responsible reporting.
I wish there was a simple way of dealing with this problem, but there isn’t. Technology will help;Facebook now has a system for identifying and deleting untrue stories posted as true. But this is only a partial fix for a problem that goes far beyond social media.
Ultimately, news consumers— average people — must take it upon themselves to learn how to identify fake news, irresponsible news sources and those peddling a political agenda from those that strive to tell the objective truth, exercise quality control and editorial oversight, correct errors, and maintain a reasonable separation between reportage and opinion.
I think it would help the average citizen to understand some press conventions that are seldom if ever spelled out. For example, what is the difference between “on the record” and “off the record”? Are anonymous sources and leaked information always to be distrusted?
It might surprise many people that most leaked information comes from official sources, not those with nefarious motives. It’s anexclusive forone news outlet, given in a way that essentially forces the outlet to use it exactly as the leaker intends. Leaking is really just a public relations tool, not something that is per se malevolent.
And it goes without saying that many leaks serve the public purpose by giving people information they have a perfect right to know. Maintaining secrecy often only protects the powerful from taking responsibility for their actions. Too bad more of Harvey Weinstein’s indiscretions weren’t leaked before many more actors were hurt by them.
There are many books about the craft of journalism, but few are written for the general public. Books on tradecraft tend to be written by and for professionals in an industry. This makes them boring and unhelpful to the average person who doesn’t need to know all the details on how sausage is made, just enough to enjoy the end product.
More: Call junk science by its rightful name: Fake news
I’m not a journalist, but I have a deep familiarity with the industry primarily as a source for many stories and interviews, and one whose work required dealing with reporters at our nation’s principal newspapers, magazines and other media on a daily basis for decades.
From this I have learned some lessons that I have distilled into The Truth Matters, a short citizen’s guide to the media and fake news to help people separate truth from lies. I hope it will be for consumers of news what the classic Elements of Stylehas been for generations of writers:a reminder of things we once learned but perhaps have forgotten.
My book won’t cure the problem of fake news, but it will give average people tools to navigate the media landscape and some defenses against untruth. In the end, the best cure is critical thinking and skepticism about stories that suitour religious, ideological or political beliefs too well —or are simply too good to be true.

Donald Trump Jr. Expresses His Disappointment With The Nebraska Democratic Party Official’s Remarks On Scalise!
Donald Trump Jr. Just posted this on Twitter: “So much for tolerance: Nebraska Democratic Party official: ‘I’m glad Scalise got shot. I wish he was f–king dead'”
So much for tolerance: Nebraska Democratic Party official: 'I'm glad Scalise got shot. I wish he was f–king dead' https://t.co/dhLS0l7oTB
For those of you who missed this, one Nebraska Democratic Party official is facing quite the amount of backlash now. Namely, an audio recording was revealed on YouTube on Thursday with Phil Montag, a technology chairman, mentioning how satisfied he was with Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise getting shot this past week at a baseball practice.
Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman Jane Kleeb disclosed for FOX 42 News on Thursday that it was his voice indeed.
“His whole job is to get people, convince Republicans to (expletive) kick people off (expletive) health care. I’m glad he got shot,” expressed Montag in the audio recording.
Montag is on the hunt for a new position now. Kleeb dismissed him after the recording surfaced.
“I wish he was (expletive) dead,” expressed Montag in the recording. “We obviously condemn any kind of violence, whether it’s comments on Facebook or comments in a meeting,” said Kleeb when called on the phone on Thursday.
FOX 42 News attempted many times to get to Montag on Thursday. He got e-mailed, sent text messages and called by phone. On top of that, they tried to meet with him tête-à-tête, but, that didn’t happen too.
“Our country is better than the political rhetoric that is out there from both the far right and the far left,” said Kleeb.
The audio recording that was posted on social media on Thursday occurs only a week following a Nebraska state Democratic leader getting required to resign. Chelsey Gentry-Tipton was involved in a controversy regarding a Facebook post aimed for Congressman Scalise.
What are your thoughts on this?",1
"It’s finally happening. After four long years of slowly watching The Fox News Network turn more and more to the left, conservatives can finally rejoice and take solace in the fact that the Roger Ailes and crew from the old and great Fox News Network we have all looked to for fair and balanced news finally have awoken and are in negotiations to form their own conservative news outlet. One without the influence of founder and current owner Pro-Hillary Roger Murdock, his liberal sons, nor their feminist wives.
If you can all recall right after the 2012 election where then-Republican Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney, along with the help of Democrat Party paid media hacks like the morbidly obese CNN correspondent Candy Crawly, choked his way to a stunning defeat even though President Obama was largely unpopular. In the days following that election, it was reported that Fox News Super Star Sean Hannity was being bumped to an hour later to a pre-recorded time slot. The change was being made to make room for the closet leftist Megyn Kelly.
Kelly started off great but later cut her hair to resemble the little guy from MSNBC, Rachel Maddow, and it all went downhill from there. She showed her true colors by acting like a star struck Teeny Bopper meeting her first celebrity crush during her first White House Christmas dinner under then President Obama and by attacking then-candidate Trump while hosting the first Republican primary debate. After this, her ratings plummeted and she now has a new show on MSNBC.
A well-placed source close to the proposal tells Mediaite that serious discussions are underway to create an alternative conservative cable network on the belief that the Fox News Network is moving too far to the left. The source, who is engaged in the talks, says a meeting is planned for today with two prominent high-powered television executives, some underperforming conservative networks and people who have an interest and the ability to fund a new network.
“The potential aim? Putting “the old band” back together. There are certainly plenty of (out-of-work?) conservative powerhouses to pick from that could star on a new network, and perhaps even some executives from within Fox News who might be lured by the new opportunity. Could the new channel include stars like the ousted Bill O’Reilly, who didn’t waste much time hitting the podcast waves after he was fired amid a sexual harassment scandal? Could Tomi Lahren, the conservative mega star, who was recently sidelined at The Blaze also take on a prominent role? The exact “who” won’t be clear until the deal is more defined but the source says the pitch is that the network could immediately reach at least 85 million homes.
For the 89 percent of Republican voters who cast ballots for Trump, their backing represented a departure from many of the principles that have animated the American conservative movement for six decades. Today, those voters remain broadly supportive of the president personally, and as a result, insiders say, the conservative media have been increasingly pulled by a tractor beam that demands positive coverage of the president regardless of how far he wanders from the ideas they once enforced. Producers and editors have been faced with a choice: Provide that coverage or lose your audience…
Over the course of the campaign and into the beginning of his presidency, anti-Trump voices slowly receded from Fox’s air, while those favorable to him began to appear more often. This has been most evident in the transformation of the panel segment on Baier’s 6 p.m. newscast, “Special Report,” once the premier venue for conservative thought on television. As the political reality on the right shifted, Baier made an effort to include more pro-Trump voices on the panel. Trump critic Jonah Goldberg of National Review and Weekly Standard editor Stephen Hayes, once fixtures on the panel, began to appear less frequently; the network also declined to renew the contract of George Will, another panelist, and a reliable Trump critic. Trump-friendly pundits like Washington Times columnist Charles Hurt, American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp and his wife, Mercedes, and Republican strategist Lisa Boothe now appear in their stead. In late March, Fox announced it had signed the Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway, a reliably pro-Trump commentator, as a contributor.”
Sadly it seems all this shedding of pro-Trump voices at Fox News came to a fever pitch when Fox News Superstar, and most watch cable news show, of over 20 years, Bill O’Reilly, was fired this past month. He was let go because of unproven allegations of sexual harassment.
We know the drill. When a Democrat is accused he is “innocent until proven guilty,” but for conservatives, it’s “guilty until proven innocent but the the doubt will still linger for life.” We know, we know. Whatever happens, one thing’s for sure, next book Bill O’Reilly writes will be called “Killing Fox News.”

"Theliberation of Mosul from ISISis nearly complete,but the Islamic State remains a formidable presence in Iraq, and numerous obstacles remain in the way of Iraqi Security forces totally eradicating the ruthless terror group.
Which pockets of the Sunni-dominated terror group the government sets its sights on next will depend on numerous factors: Which ISIS-controlled areas of Baghdad pose the greatest threat, which communities are in most urgent need of liberation and the outcome of a debate about whether to include Iranian forces, which were excluded from the Mosul fight.
One obscure but strategically important area in need of liberation is the Sunni-majority district of Hawija, which is 100 miles south of Mosul and 30 miles west of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. The location of the district, which had a pre-ISIS population of around 450,000, enables the jihadists to attack the two cities as well as areas in north Tikrit. Also, Hawija’s proximity to mountainous areas has also provided cover for ISIS cells.
“There are constant complaints by local officials in Salahuddin and Diyala of ISIS fighters infiltrating into these areas from Hawija, and attacks have stepped up in the latter in the last few months,” Middle East analyst Joel Wing, who runs the Musings on Iraq website, told Fox News.
“The terrain favors the insurgents because they are remote, rural, and have lots of cover like palm groves, etc. that allow ISIS fighters to hide from the Iraqi forces and air surveillance. Diyala also offers access to Baghdad and has been the source for some car bombings into the capital.”
The humanitarian and sanitary conditions are said to be “beyond desperate,” one resident, who can only be identified as Jassim for security reasons, told Fox News. “There is no food, no medicine, no basic elements for life, not even water. It is difficult to obtain safe drinking water. All this has led to the spread of many diseases and many people have died from diseases easy to cure, because there is a lack of treatment. Death is the only cure for relief from the suffering.”
Food prices have surged to 30 times what they were pre-ISIS, and the vast majority of those living there are not able to afford even such basics. Smugglers charge $200 per family member to escape and many of those fleeing end up killed by a landmine or sniper or drown in the Euphrates.
While the urgency of a Hawija offensive remains high, the complexity of such a venture is daunting. It has been planned and then delayed numerous times in the past year, with different participating forces reportedly unable to agree on the appropriate course and order of action.
Widespread worries have been raised over the likely participation of Iran-backed Shiite militias, the People’s Mobilization Forces (PMF), often referred to as the Hashd al-Shaabi, in the military offensive to retake Hawija. While the militias have proven to be an effective fighting force against ISIS in participation with Iraqi forces, they were deliberately kept out of the Mosul offensive to avoid sectarian flares with Sunni residents. However, the Tehran-loyal fighters are reportedly being geared away for the final ISIS slaying – prompting concerns that they may commit revenge crimes against Sunnis and even Kurdish fighters given Iran’s opposition to Kurdish independence.
A spokesperson for the U. S.-led coalition told Fox News that the military is planning and what happens next is ""very much the decision of the government of Iraq and the Iraqi Security forces,"" but that the ""coalition will support their decision."" Brigade General Hugh McAslan, a New Zealand deputy commander of the coalition force in Baghdad, emphasized that while the coalition does not provide direct support to the PMF ""in the interest of safety"" they ""maintain situational awareness to their locations on the battlefield.""
Kurdish security officials have bemoaned that Baghdad’s delay in a Hawija offensive has allowed the infiltration ofISIS sleeper cellsand facilitated fatal hit-and-run attacks against the Kurdish Peshmerga in southern Kirkuk. The ongoing delay in liberation, some say, has also boosted the morale of existing ISIS militants as they have been able to carry out small but frequent attacks from this bastion.
Adding to the complexity, many in Hawija are believed to be sympathetic to the Sunni-dominated terror group, preferring its rule over the oppression of a Shia-led Baghdad government.
“ISIS is in control of (Hawija) completely. Much of the time since 2003, it was under overt or covert control of Al Qaeda and Baathist elements,” James Jeffrey, U. S. ambassador to Iraq from 2010-2012 and now the Philip Solondz Distinguished Fellow at the Washington Institute, told Fox News. “Hawija will be a tough fight with the population probably joining in on the side of ISIS. With bigger issues like Mosul, people just don’t want to focus on Hawija.”
But besides Hawija, other areas need Baghdad’s attention: Tel Afar west of Mosul in the Nineveh province; the adjacent Salahuddin province; pockets in Anbar province close to the Syrian border; Diyala province; the Hamrin Mountains; two towns in Kirkuk province and 500 small villages in Kirkuk province.
Last week, Muhammad al-Khazary, an Iraqi Defense Ministry spokesperson,statedthat preparations for the Hawija mission were in place, but no specifics have been made public.
This week, Kurdish officials said that, despite their increasingobjections, Baghdad still intends to commence Tel Afar and Ramadi operations first.",0

"Movie director Oliver Stone has slammed the Obama regime for deliberately spreading Cold War style propaganda about Russia, in a Facebook postpublished on Thursday.
As tensions between the U. S. government and Russia escalate over the dubious claim that Putin ordered the hacking of the recent U.S. presidential election, Stone urged for calm and clarity amid increasingly anti-Russian rhetoric in the media.
As 2016 draws to a close, we find ourselves a deeply unsettled nation. We’re unable to draw the lines of our national interest. Is it jobs and economy, is it national security, or is it now in our interest to ensure global security — in other words, act as the world’s policemen?
As the “failing” (to quote Trump) New York Times degenerates into a Washington Post organization with its stagnant Cold War vision of a 1950s world where the Russians are to blame for most everything — Hillary’s loss, most of the aggression and disorder in the world, the desire to destabilize Europe, etc. — the Times has added the issue of ‘fake news’ to reassert its problematic role as the dominant voice for the Washington establishment. Certainly this is true in the case of Russia’s ‘hacking’ the 2016 election and putting into office its Manchurian Candidate in Donald Trump. Apparently the CIA (via various unnamed intelligence officials), and the FBI, NSA, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (who notoriously lied to Congress in the Snowden affair), President Obama, the DNC, Hillary Clinton, and Congress agree that Russia, and Mr. Putin predominantly, is responsible.
Certainly the psychotic, war-loving Senator John McCain is right up there alongside these patriots, calling President Putin a “thug, bully and a murderer and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying.” He actually said this — the man whose sound judgment chose Sarah Palin as his VP nominee in ’08. And the Times followed by printing the story in its full glory on page one, clearly agreeing with McCain’s point of view. I don’t remember Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, or Reagan, in the darkest days of the 1950s/80s, ever singling out a Russian President like this. The invective was aimed at the Soviet regime, but never were Khrushchev or Brezhnev the target of this bile. I guess this is a new form of American diplomacy. If a black youth in our inner cities were killed or a Pakistani wedding party were murdered by our drones, would President Obama be singled out as a murderer, bully, thug? Such personalization is a sign of sickness in our thinking and way beneath what should be our standards.
Note the enclosed link from the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (which includes the ex-NSA reformer Bill Binney, a mathematical genius who inspired the Nic Cage character in “Snowden,” and who talks here about what hacking really means, as opposed to a ‘leak’). The Times and other mainstream media have surprisingly evaded any contrary evidence, such as that presented by Craig Murray, ex-ambassador and Wikileaks spokesman who says he was given the information in a Washington park by a Democratic ‘insider’ who was disgusted by the behavior of the DNC; Murray then gave it to Wikileaks. This was a ‘leak,’ not a ‘hack,’ and always seemed to me the likely source for this scandal (as I think the Sony leak was as well, falsely blamed on North Korea, but that’s another matter). And if this were to be properly investigated, it might very well lead to the discovery that this was Hillary Clinton’s ‘Nixon moment.’ Clearly the DNC offices were up to no good. Ironically, Clinton first made her name as one of the investigators into Watergate. See Mark Ames’s article, “Site Behind McCarthyite Blacklist,” tracking this foul play to Washington Post journalist Craig Timberg.
I remember well in the 1950s when the Russians were supposed to be in our schools, Congress, State Department — and according to many Eisenhower/Nixon supporters — about to take over our country without serious opposition (and they call me paranoid!). It was this same media who insisted on our need to go to Vietnam to defend our freedoms against the communists 6,000 miles away. And after the Red Scare finally went away for good in 1991, let us remind ourselves that It never ended. It became Hussein of Iraq with his weapons of mass destruction, and talk of the ‘mushroom cloud.’ It became a Demon, as real as any Salem Witch Trial. It was Gaddafi of Libya, and then it was Assad of Syria. In other words, as in an Orwellian prophesy, it never ended, and I can guarantee you it never will — unless we the people who can still think for ourselves in this existential matter, can say “Enough” to this demon act. “Enough,’ “go away” — laugh in their faces.
Of course, the NYT/WaPo nexus rarely will publish any of our serious dissents and thus we must take refuge in alternate media, such as ‘Consortiumnews,’ ‘The Intercept,’ ‘Naked Capitalism,’ ‘Counterpunch,’ ‘Zero Hedge,’ ‘Antiwar.com,’ ‘Truthdig,’ ‘Common Dreams.’ Yet I think we were all quite shocked (but not surprised) when recently we saw 200 websites listed as tools of the Kremlin (WaPo’s November 24, “Russian propaganda effort helped spread ‘fake news’ during election”).
My God, the ghost of Izzy Stone is back from the 1950s! For that matter, so is Tom Clancy from the ’80s. False thrillers will now be written about the Russians hacking the American elections. Money and TV serials will be made. I’ve never read such hysterical junk (call it what it is — “fake news”) in the New York Times, in which the editorials have become outrageous diatribes, many of them presumably written by Serge Schmemann, one of those ideologues who still finds Russians under his bed at night (called ‘White Russians’ in the old days who, like right-wing Cubans in Miami, can never live down past grievances). Schmemann is obviously riding high at the NYT edit board. We can make fun of this, but it’s an irresponsible and dangerous editorializing, which has invaded the MSM’s reporting. Their thinking has clearly influenced the Pentagon and many of our Generals’ statements. When one group-think controls our national conversation, it’s so sad, a pathetic loss of judgment, and it becomes ultra dangerous. In this spirit, I’m linking several crucial essays of new vintage, pointing out the disgrace the MSM has become.
As much as we may disagree with Donald Trump (and I do) he’s right now target number one of the MSM propaganda — until, that is, he changes to the anti-Kremlin track over, God knows, some kind of petty dispute cooked up by CIA, and in his hot-headed way starts fighting with the Russians. It wouldn’t be long then until he declares a state of war against Russia. I have no doubt then that our over-financed military ($10 to every 1 Russian dollar) will mean NOTHING against a country that right now believes the US, with the largest buildup of NATO on its borders since Hitler’s World War II, is crazed enough to prepare for a preemptive strike. In his analysis, “The Need to Hold Saudi Arabia Accountable,” Robert Parry points out that this conflict ironically started in the 1980s with the Neoconservatives defining Iran as the number one terrorist sponsor in the world. How this leads to our present mess is a brilliant analysis that is unknown to the American public.
I urge you to read the following articles and stay calm in your thinking. But bring it to bear in some way.
As a believer in what Thich Nhat Hanh says, every single one of us, even through our prayers, can add to the betterment of this world. I never thought I’d find myself at this point in time praying for the level-headedness of a Donald Trump. You might remember “The Iliad.” As Homer would have it, the gods would huddle up during each day’s battles and decide on the outcome. Who would die and who would live. Are the gods still listening?",1
"A National Public Radio investigation has uncovered evidence that the majority of ‘fake news’ websites are run by a Democratic organization in California called “Disinfomedia”.
The NPR investigation found that the “godfather” of fake news is a Democrat based in Culver City, California, who runs a multitude of the most prominent fake news sites on the web, aimed at discrediting the alternative media.
NPR’s Laura Sydell described the process of tracking down fake news sites — many of which had names and formats designed to look like real news websites — and discovering many that led to one company in particular:
The sites include NationalReport.net, USAToday.com.co, WashingtonPost.com.co. All the addresses linked to a single rented server inside Amazon Web Services. That meant they were all likely owned by the same company. Jansen found an email address on one of those sites and he was able to link that address to a name: Jestin Coler.
Online, Coler was listed as the founder and CEO of a company called Disinfomedia.
Coler’s company, Disinfomedia, owns many faux news sites — he won’t say how many. But he says his is one of the biggest fake news businesses out there, which makes him kind of like a godfather of the industry.
Once Coler agreed to an interview, he told NPR that the purpose of starting his fake news empire in 2013 was “to highlight the extremism of the white nationalist alt-right” — or, in Coler’s exact words:“The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right, publish blatantly false or fictional stories, and then be able to publicly denounce those stories and point out the fact that they were fiction.”
Coler claimed that his fake news stories worked because “theyfit into existing right-wing conspiracy theories.” Left-wingers, he said, were less gullible. (NPR did not question that claim — even though one of the largest social media sites, Occupy Democrats, produces fabricated or exaggerated news for liberals to share on Facebook and elsewhere.)
The moral questions raised by fake news did seem to trouble Coler, though not all that much. He admitted that he has a financial incentive to keep going — and, more important, a political one: “Really the financial part of it isn’t the only motivator for me. I do enjoy making a mess of the people that share the content that comes out of our site. It’s not just the financial incentive for me. I still enjoy the game, I guess.",1
"Fox News has lost few big names, including their famous CEO Roger Ailes who was basically the founder of the cable news channel.
The big names who left are Megyn Kelly, Greta Van Susteren, Gretchen Karlson, and few others who are not so famous. Before that they lost Glenn Beck.
Also, the biggest star on the network, Bill O’Reilly had problems with sexual harassment allegations and out of court settlement.
So there are a lot of problems and a lot of challenges to overcome for Fox News directors and owners, but thankfully there are good news also.
One of the rising stars, Tucker Carlson had big shoes to fill as he transitioned into former Fox News host Megyn Kelly’s old time slot.
The Kelly File had typically been the second-most watched show on the network, enjoying an average of 2.98 million viewers a night as recently as October of last year.
But Fox News has received even higher ratings with Tucker Carlson Tonight during its premiere week in Kelly’s time slot. After Carlson’s show moved from the 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time slot to the 9 p.m. EST slot, ratings shot up, quickly averaging 3 million viewers a night.
Tucker Carlson is not new in the TV business. He is over 20 years on various channels and shows, so he is very experienced and very good in his job.
That’s why he is so good in his role in this moment on Fox News, he knows how to make a good show!
We think that very soon he is going to replace Bill O’Reilly as he is going for retirement very soon! After all, Bill is nearly 70 years old, and this business is very tough so similar to David Letterman, old Bill will have to go and rest and travel around the world.
Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Judge Jeanine and others are going to be the future of great Fox News!",1

"HBO said Wednesday night that it was investigating the hacking of several of the cable channel's Twitter accounts, which came as the company is trying to figure out how episodes of its megahit series ""Game of Thrones"" and other materials were leaked online.
The accounts of several HBO series, including ""Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,"" ""True Blood,"" ""Veep"" and ""Vinyl,"" tweeted a message Wednesday night purporting to be from the notorious OurMine hackers. It appeared that only U. S.-based accounts were affected — @HBOUK and @HBOCanada appeared to emerge unscathed, for example.
HBO regained control of the accounts within about 40 minutes and deleted the tweets, which NBC News archived before they were taken down:
HBO told NBC News late Wednesday only that ""we are investigating.""
OurMine, sometimes called OurMine Team, has been blamed for taking over social media and other online accounts of several prominent people and institutions in the last 2 years or so, including those of Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, BuzzFeed and TechCrunch. Many of the messages mirrored those that were posted Wednesday night.
OurMine is anonymous, and it couldn't be determined Wednesday night whether it was, in fact, behind the HBO hack. In all of Wednesday night's tweets, the name ""OurMine"" was rendered with faint accent marks — as ""OurMine,"" not ""OurMine"" — a construction that the hackers aren't known to have used before.
HBO said it didn't have enough information to discuss that.
In October 2016, BuzzFeed posted a story linking OurMine Team to a teenage Saudi hacker. BuzzFeed was hacked the next day, with an article appearing on the site apparently posted by OurMine.",0
"* A gunman opened fire inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday
* 26 people were killed and 20 were injured in the attack, officials said
* The suspect has been identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, CBS News has learned
* President Trump pledged his full support to Texas and the communities affected
* FBI and ATF agents are assisting local law enforcement with the investigation
SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas -- A gunman opened fire inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others, authorities said.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the attack the deadliest mass shooting in his state's history. The youngest victim was 5 years old and the oldest was 72. Officials said 23 people were found dead inside the church, two outside, one died after being taken to a hospital.
The shooting suspect has been identified as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, federal law enforcement sources told CBS News.
Kelley is a former U. S. Air Force member who served from 2010 to 2014. He was dishonorably discharged and court martialed in May 2014, CBS News has learned.
On Sunday night, authorities only identified the suspect as a young white male. They said he was seen dressed in all black and tactical gear -- including a ""ballistic vest"" -- at a local gas station at 11:20 a.m. He then exited his vehicle, crossed the street and began firing an AR-15 style weapon at the church, officials said. The suspect entered the church and continued to fire.
As he exited the church, a local resident grabbed his gun and pursued the suspect, who dropped his weapon and fled the scene.
The suspect was later found dead inside his vehicle. Officials are unsure if he was shot by a resident or suffered a self inflicted gunshot wound, said Freeman Martin, regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety.
The daughter of the church's pastor was one of the victim's killed in the shooting, her mother Sherri Pomeroy told CBS News via text message.
""My husband and I were ironically out of town in two different states. We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,""  Pomeroy said Sunday.
She added, ""Neither of us have made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation. I am at the Charlotte airport trying to get home as soon as I can.""
Video from KENS-TV showed first responders at the scene, located about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.
Dana Fletcher, a business owner in the area, told CBS News she saw a ""ton"" of sheriff's vehicles and ambulances racing down the road. She said she doesn't know what happened but said there was heavy police presence and people were being airlifted from the scene.
Special agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said they were responding to the shooting.
A law enforcement official said an FBI crisis response team is also at the scene assisting local police, CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. She says officials are trying to determine a motive for the shooting.
President Trump, who is on his first presidential trip to Asia, addressed the situation from Tokyo, calling it a ""horrific shooting.""
""Victims and their families were in their sacred place of worship. We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel,"" Mr. Trump said in televised remarks.
""In dark times such as these, Americans do we what do best and we pull together. We lock hands and we joins arms. Through the tears and through the sadness we stand strong.""
Mr. Trump pledged his full support to the state of Texas and the local communities affected by Sunday's attack.
""We offer our thanks to the first responders, to the FBI, all of the many people involved. I will continue to follow the developments closely. All of America is praying to God.""

"Every week the Russia story crumbles a bit more. Whether it is the loss of credibility of Crowdstrike’s hacking report, or the revelation by WikiLeaks that the CIA can make a cyber attack look like it came from wherever they want, the leftist media can’t catch a break. The FBI and NSA have both testified that there is no evidence that there was any hacking of actual voting, and the WikiLeaks allegations throw doubt on Russia’s involvement in hacking the DNC or Podesta emails. Even if they did, the media and the Democrats still have yet to convince anyone that the emails are the reason that voters chose Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Despite this, the media zealously chase after every angle of the story, mostly using “anonymous sources” and “individuals familiar with the investigation.”
Well, they chase almost every angle on the Russia story — except for the very real connections between the Clinton campaign and Russia.
The media keep the Russia story at the presidential level, failing to provide any sort of context for Trump’s win. The Democrats lost more than 1,000 seats at the federal and state level during Obama’s presidency, including 9 Senate seats, 62 House seats, 12 governorships, and a startling 958 state legislative seats. Did the Russians have a hand in all of those elections? Or are those election results clear signals of America’s shift away from Obama and Clinton, who promised to be a third Obama term?
In the business world, feverishly pouring resources and time into a bad product in the hopes of validating past investments is called the sunk cost fallacy. Is that what is motivating the mainstream media to keep churning out their Russian “election hacking” coverage? Or is there another reason? Perhaps they are so masochistic as to enjoy President Trump sticking his thumb in their eye via Twitter:
It is the same Fake News Media that said there is “no path to victory for Trump” that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam!
While they continue to desperately push stories about Russia, the mainstream media remain practically silent on the story they should be focusing on — the surveillance of Donald Trump and his campaign staff by the Obama administration. Unless the media want to portray Rep.Devin Nunes (R-CA) as a paranoid schizophrenic (Breitbart News wouldn’t put it past them), we now have strong indications that President Obama and his staff surveilled Trump and staff. This may or may not have been illegal, but certainly was cheating by any definition.
The revelations about this spying are coming fast and thick. On Thursday, Kimberly Strassel outlined some of the key allegations in The Wall Street Journal:
First, there were dozens of documents with information about Trump officials. Second, the information these documents contained was not related to Russia. Third, while many reports did “mask” identities (referring, for instance, to “U. S. Person 1 or 2”) they were written in ways that made clear which Trump officials were being discussed. Fourth, in at least one instance, a Trump official other than Mr. Flynn was outright unmasked. Finally, these documents were circulated at the highest levels of government.
More news is already breaking on on the unmasking front — Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, has been reported as the official who requested the unmasking. This followed a Fox News report that a “very senior” official had made the requests. The headlines about Rice began following a post by Mike Cernovich naming her, along with broadcasts by him on Periscope, Twitter’s video streaming application.
The media’s response to this story was immediate. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the response we’d hope for — a hard-hitting investigation into why Americans were under surveillance completely unrelated to questions about Russian connections. Instead, the media have been attackingNunes with everything they’ve got.
MSNBC host Joe Scarborough tweeted, “If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman.” He later said on his program “It is so obvious that this guy is getting bullied by the White House.” Will he next say Congress needs millions for anti-bully training?
CNN’s Jake Tapper joined the party with a contentious interview of Nunes, including the stunning phrase: “Some question your impartiality.” For anyone associated with CNN to say that with a straight face is quite astonishing. As a thought experiment, what if we replaced Woodward and Bernstein with Tapper and Scarborough? Would Watergate have played out differently? I expect most of their energies would have been spent unmasking Deep Throat for his audacity in finding and sharing the truth, not to mention the patriarchal sexism of his code name!
The rest of the media has been following suit. From parroting Rep.Adam Schiff (D-CA) saying that Nunes acted inappropriately, to the general Democrat talking points that Nunes must step down as Intel Chair, the mainstream media would have us believe that ABC News breathlessly reporting that Nunes refuses to step down from the committee is journalism at its finest.
We know that “Nunes must step down” holds as much weight as the Russia story does, so Breitbart News along with our compatriots outside of the mainstream media bubble will continue to follow the Trump surveillance story with accurate reporting and insightful analysis. President Trump will continue to run circles around the biased media as he did this weekend, dominating headlines by lambasting NBC’s “Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd.”
You may be left wondering, “What will the mainstream media do?” They will certainly continue pounding the rapidly fading Russia-Trump story and do their best to avoid the surveillance of Trump story. They will also continue bemoaning their loss of paying customers.
A Gallup poll in September of 2016 found that 68 percent of Americans distrust the media. How would that number look today? Following months of uninterrupted media coverage of unproven Russian meddling, media distrust will likelybe higher today than six months ago. In fact, thenumbers are probably so bad that the mainstream media will have no choice but to claim Russia hacked the poll.",1
"The liberal bias and continued attack against President Trump are so obvious the majority of Americans laugh and ignore these news media outlets. Still, something has to be done we have to fight these fake news media! Which is the reason why we are reporting what Tucker Carlson did to NBC, he totally destroyed them!
I’m sure you remember the now infamous leak of the ‘grab em by the pussy’ tape that was released by NBC at the exact time they thought it would do the most damage to Trump and his campaign.
Now Tucker is accusing the top brass at NBC of being in on the leak and the attempt to derail Trump and his populist movement.
Tucker Carlson: Now keep in mind that the Access Hollywood tape had been sitting in an archive after it was shot several years before. NBC executives had know about it’s existence for several months before it aired… The network sat on it. But as November approached the temptation to shut down the Trump campaign became too much. And so NBC rose to the defense of Hillary Clinton and leaked that tape. And then they lied about it.
Now if your a news organization and somebody stole the story of the year out of your office, wouldn’t you want to know how that happened? You think you would. And yet as far as we can tell NBC never conducted a meaningful investigation on how that tape wound up at the Washington Post. That’s because they already knew the identity of the leaker. It was them!
Tucker deserves an award, It should be called the “Tucker Award 2017” for real Journalism!
I guess NBC don’t know about Hillary’s dealings with Russia. They seem to have forgotten all of that!!!

"President Trump came forward in defense of Roy Moore, because their is no evidence that the allegations are true. Liberals are furious that the President believes in ‘innocent until proven guilty’. Even though they shun Bill Clinton’s accusers they treat Roy Moore accusations like they are proven facts. In an awful rant MSNBC’s John Heilemann accused Trump of siding with pedophiles.
“Trump sees himself in Roy Moore, he does. He sees the politics of it too. The momentum was for Hillary Clinton, all of the polls said Hillary Clinton was going to win and there’s all these people in the Trump base standing up saying, ‘fake news, fake news, fake news.’ He listens to these press conferences,” said Heilemann, even though that was fake news.
“He recognizes the dynamic in Alabama where he hears Roy Moore’s defenders attacking the Washington Post, saying that the women made it all up. He thinks the woman who attacked him made it all up,” said Heilemann.
He added, “The best analogy to me for this, trying to loop all this together, is Charlottesville. Was there no one who could go into the Oval Office and say to Donald Trump it’s bad to be on the side of neo-Nazis? The answer was ‘no’ then, and the answer is ‘no’ now,” said Heilimann.
“What’s worse, a child predator or a neo-Nazi? I’m not going to make a call on that, but Donald Trump didn’t seem to find a problem to be on the side of neo-Nazis and apparently he doesn’t see a problem being on the side of the accused child predators either,” he said. Is MSNBC fake news?",1
"FollowingSeymour Hersh’s claim that the raid on the Osama bin Laden compound in 2011 was “one big lie,” the following quotesfrom mainstream media outlets offer conclusive proof that the government and media knew that bin Laden had died in December 2001 in Tora Bora due to kidney failure.
All sources are from the mainstream media, many of which have since been “scrubbed” from the internet.
2000 to September 2001: Reports Emerge of bin Laden Dying From Kidney Disease
In March 2000 the Chicago Tribune reports that an Afghan witness and “Western intelligence official” say bin Laden is suffering from severe kidney and liver failure: Chicagotribune.com
This story was also picked up by CBS News in 2000, who outright lead with the title that “Bin Laden Reported to be Dying” from “kidney disease:”Cbsnews.com
In July 2001, the South Asia Analysis Group reports: “Bin Laden, who suffers from renal deficiency, has been periodically undergoing dialysis in a Peshawar military hospital with the knowledge and approval of the Inter-Services Intelligence, (ISI) if not of Gen. Pervez Musharraf himself”:Saag.com
September to November 2001: bin Laden is Trapped in Afghanistan, Unable to Receive Kidney Treatments
In September 2001, PBS’ Frontline interviews the former general counsel for the CIA, mentioning reports from 1998 that the DEA found out Osama bin Laden was undergoing kidney dialysis with a doctor in Peshwar. They mention further that the DEA wanted to poison bin Laden through his dialysis machine, but the CIA allegedy rejected this due to the ban on assassinations: Pbs.org
In November 2001, The Guardian is reporting that French intelligence officials say bin Laden was flown to Dubai for kidney treatment in July of 2001, where he also met with several CIA agents and the head of Saudi intelligence. This story is also picked up by several French newspapers: Theguardian.com
In his first interview since 9/11, in November 2001 bin Laden talks to a Pakistani newspaper and claims that his “kidneys are all right” and denies visiting a hospital in Dubai the previous year (note that he may have visited one in Pakistan). In the same interview he also asserts, clearly lying, that he has “nuclear weapons.”: Dawn.com
December 2001: bin Laden is Dead, Buried in Afghanistan In December of 2001, the New York Times reports on “high-level murmurings that bin Laden is dead.” Nytimes.com
That same day,citing a Taliban source, Fox News reports that bin Laden has died due to an “untreated lung complication” from kidney disease. About 30 “close associates” reportedly attended bin Laden’s funeral in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan. A source concludes that the U. S. government and other forces are in a “mad search operation” but will never be able to locate the now-dead bin Laden, buried in an unmarked location:Foxnews.com
Late December 2001 to March 2002: bin Laden’s “Death Video” is Released In late December of 2001, after reports of bin Laden’s funeral, a new video appears of a gaunt, sickly Osama bin Laden. The London Telegraph reports, verbatim: “The recording was dismissed by the Bush administration yesterday as sick propaganda possibly designed to mask the fact the al-Qa’eda leader was already dead.” One aid further concludes that the video was created earlier in the event bin Laden is dead, who by December of 2001 was so heavily surrounded he would have been unable to escape to obtain kidney dialysis:Telegraph.co.uk
At this time CBS news also runs a story on bin Laden receiving kidney disease treatments in Pakistan the week before 9/11. Link:Osama bin Laden Near Death in 2002 (from Dan Rather CBS); US Government bin Laden LIE In January of 2002, The Guardian reports that the president of Pakistan speculates that bin Laden is now dead of untreated kidney disease based on video and photographs of a gaunt-looking bin Laden:Thegaurdian.com
In January of 2002, based on his analysis of video and photographs of bin Laden from December 2001, CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta says that bin Laden seems to be having renal failure. He notes kidney dialysis is expensive, and suggests bin Laden would need help in obtaining medical treatment: CNN.com
In March 2002, the BBC reports on an interview with bin Laden’s wife, who speaks of bin Laden in the past tense, notes his failing kidney and frequent use of pills and other medicines. She says she has not seen her husband since September 2001, but holds out hope that he is still alive: “I feel deep inside me that he is still alive.” She also notes that bin Laden’s wish was to die in Afghanistan and nowhere else: “He never spoke to me about his intention to leave Afghanistan and always wished to die there. He told me once that if he ever left Afghanistan, it would be to meet his Creator.” She also says that bin Laden “always suffered from kidney and stomach pains and that he “told me once that he was going to Pakistan for treatment.”:BBC.co.uk
In March and April of 2002, U. S. officials downplay the threat of bin Laden, with Rumsfeld even saying the bin Laden threat has been “neutralized.” Even Bush, called out for rarely mentioning bin Laden in 2002, admits: “We haven’t heard from him [bin Laden] in a long time… I don’t know where he is. I really just don’t spend that much time on him, to be honest with you.” Link: Bush: Truly not concerned about bin Laden (short version) In May 2002, ABC News reports on a new spliced-together tape from unknown time periods in which bin Laden appears “about the same” (that is, sickly-looking) as in the tape from December 2011. ABC News also says they have “learned intelligence reports indicate bin Laden had received a kidney transplant in Pakistan,” but do not know when: ABC News
July 2002: FBI Chief Says bin Laden is Most Likely Dead; Nothing from bin Laden Since December 2001 In July 2002, the BBC reveals a bombshell: the FBI’s counter-terrorism chief Dale Watson says bin Laden is ‘”probably dead.” Conveniently, bin Laden’s followers’ claim that bin Laden will “not make more video statements until his group launches another attack on the United States.”:BBC News
In July 2002, CNN reports that bin Laden’s close bodyguards were captured in February of 2002, but not bin Laden. The article also quotes mentions some high-level officials: “Some high-level U. S. officials are already convinced by such evidence that bin Laden, who has not been seen or heard from in months, is dead.”:Cnn.com
In July 2002, Time Magazine reports that “intelligence officials are not certain whether Osama bin Laden is alive or dead” but that “they have found a tantalizing document that suggests he was living at least as recently as the last days of December [of 2001].”: Time.com
In July 2002, The New York Times runs another article on how Osama bin Laden is likely dead. The author notes how unusual it would be for bin Laden, known for his constant desire for media attention, would be silent for over half a year: Nytimes.com
October 2002: Intelligence Officials Confirm bin Laden is Dead; bin Laden’s Will is Released Also in October 2002 the D. C.-based news service The World Tribune, citing Israeli intelligence sources, reports that the United States and Israel have concluded that bin Laden died in Afghanistan in December 2001. They note that additional bin Laden messages are “probably fabrications,” and that bin Laden’s heir has been chosen:Archive.org
The president of Afghanistan also concludes that bin Laden is probably dead: “The more we don’t hear of him, and the more time passes, there is the likelihood that he probably is either dead or seriously wounded somewhere.”: Cnn.com
In October 2002 CNN reports that U. S. intelligence officials have obtained Osama bin Laden’s will, which is dated December 14, 2001 (approximately the same date as has been reported bin Laden’s funeral in Tora Bora by Fox News and other outlets). CNN also reports that there has been no evidence of bin Laden since December of 2001: Cnn.com
2002 Onwards: Efforts to Target bin Laden are Closed Down; bin Laden = “Elvis” In 2004, the LA Times quotes Donald Rumsfeld (who mixes up Hussein with bin Laden) as admitting: “We’ve not seen him [bin Laden] on a video since 2001.”:Newsmine.org
In 2006 the New York Times reports the CIA had officially closed down the unit focused on capturing bin Laden the previous year: Nytimes.com
In 2006, U. S. and Pakistani officials say they have not received any information about bin Laden in years: “no tips from informants, no snippets from electronic intercepts, no points on any satellite image.” The article rehashes the December 2001 video of bin Laden as the most recent evidence (other than a second-hand claim from 2003) of bin Laden’s existence. Some commandos are now giving Osama bin Laden the codename “Elvis.”: Washingtonpost.com
The available reports overwhelmingly supports the view that bin Laden died of kidney failure in December of 2001. We have mainstream media reports from a variety of sources, and zero credible evidence since then, as admitted by top level offiicals. Even if you believe the official story, the evidence very strongly suggests some entity (either the CIA, Saudi Royal Family, the Pakistani government, or all the above) helped bin Laden survive long enough via medical treatments to be killed at a later point in time. This very well could be the “one big lie” Seymour Hersh has mentioned in The Guardian recently.",1
"The current state of affairs in the world indicates that the Illuminati scheme to install an explicitOne World Government is failing at a fast rate. In other words, their century-long agenda of imposing a state-financedOne World Religionon humankind, as well as their numerous attempts of depopulating the Earth, have been thwarted. And all for a number of reasons:
* Russian President Vladimir Putin is determined not to enter any WWIII scenarios. Taken thatthe Kremlin also has access to Tesla-inspired, scalar-wave weaponry, one that hasn’t even been conceived by theMilitary-Industrial Complex, we don’t want to imagine what the repercussions of such a scenario will be.
* The stock market will continue to fall as a result of a controlled demolition, like the one in2008. The only difference is that this time, the culprits – financial terrorists and economic saboteurs, i.e. the banking establishment, will be prosecuted till justice is reached.
* Triggered by the 2000 Dot.com collapse and the 9/11War on Terror, theSecond Great Depressionhas been enduring since 2008. This means that the natural breakdown of theGlobal Economic & Financial System (GE&FS) can’t be prevented in any way.
* Controlled Demolition of the Global Economic & Financial System
Although most of you will agree that nothing can be done to prevent the NWO group from executing a complete, perfectly controlled demolition of theGlobal Economic & Financial System, there’s more to the bigger picture than meets the eyes.
Taken that the international banking crime syndicate (aka the banking elite) tries to execute this move once again, the entire system will collapse forever. And that’s not all. As the power is in the people, the banking elite might as well face a fate similar to the aristocracy during the worst years of the French Revolution.
One benefit from living in an era of dominant social media is having access to a great amount of raw truth and hard facts about the true workings of the GE&FS. Take for instance the wreck and damage on the planet done by multi-billion corporations including the Rothschilds, and the Rockefellers, Big Pharma, Big Oil, Monsanto and Halliburton, just to name a few. Today, we are all aware of their wicked actions, especially with so many interlocking directorships which incriminate them all.
There are so many extremely incriminating facts that can be found on the Internet since 1995, that those who own and run the GE&FS have never been more exposed in their wrongdoings. Any attempt to destroy the GE&FS to their benefit will lead to their end.
The greatest benefit of the internet, compared to other recorded inventions in human history, is providing a level playing field for all the players. Taken that before the internet, the Illuminati have never tolerated anything but a tilted playing field, today they are forced to learn new game rules. In case a controlled demolition of the banking system was to be executed by the financial engineers and economic architects, the people will rise and put them behind bars for good.
Now, another 2016 event, one of colossal importance, is the election of Donald Trump. This epic event shows more than anything else, including BREXIT, how much things have really changed.This also shows that people have more power now than in the past.
The Internet will be the most powerful police empowering people to put those banksters behind bars. Take for instance the global citizens investigation that has been carried out regarding Washington, D. C.Pizzagateand globalPedogate. It clearly demonstrates the power of people which is emerging in ways and places never seen before.
ThePizzagaterevelations, which are rapidly emerging as a result of the power and pervasiveness of the Internet, are creating a very favorable environment for the powerless to regain their power. Similarly, Pedogatehas provided an international forum for victims all over the world to speak the truth like never before.
Currently, the only challenge the world has yet to deal with is this establishment of extremely powerful psychopaths who have a tight grip on our society. What gives hope is the fact that this elite will be deprived of their ill-gotten gains and misappropriated wealth, which means that their influence and power over the world affairs will be greatly reduced.
Special Note: TPTB has no power to crash the economy like they used to do according to the Shemitah calendar. In case they attempt a reckless sabotage of President Trump’s term in office through a synchronized collapse, then they will lose everything. But, most importantly, they’ll never get it back. And, that’s not all. The collapse of financial institutions and economic systems will lead to a drastic fall of their age-old power and influence. As a result, the US will be forced to devise a whole new paradigm, one that is free from the endemic corporate corruption and easily manipulated institutional arrangements. The culprits should never again be granted participation in state and world affairs. Plus, they should face prosecution for their continual financial terrorism and economic devastation to both developed and developing nations.
Trump’s election following the humiliating fall of Hillary Clinton is a worldwide phenomenon that promises to put an end to despicable globalists all over the world.
Some of the first things on the new President’s agenda should include shutting down the treasonousMainstream Media, as well as getting rid of the numerous traitors from Congress, intelligence agencies, and many other departments within the U. S. Federal Government.
And the sooner he rolls his sleeves up, the better for the nation as Americans, once again will be able to take back their government. This American Republic can rebuild the image of theFounding Fathers like no one before.
And, in reality, the better the demolition, the better the foundation for the new construction to be built upon. At present, the world is but an economic prison for most of humankind, and the first step to be taken to free the people is taking down the present embodiment of the GE&FS.",1
"Here’s the thing I’ve learned about sheep over the years. They are never out of sight of each other, and their decision making is entirely driven by what they see happening to others, not to themselves. They are extremely intelligent in this other-regarding way. My sheep roam freely on the farm, and I never worry about them so long as they stay together, which they always do. But if I only count three in the flock, then I immediately go see what’s wrong. Because something is definitely wrong.
That’s the difference between a flock and a pack. A flock is a social structure designed to promote other-awareness. It has no goals, no coordinating purpose other than communication. A flock simply IS. A pack, on the other hand, is a social structure designed to harness self-aware animals in service to some goal requiring joint action — the raising of cubs, the hunting of meat, etc. Both the flock and the pack are extremely effective social structures, but they operate by entirely different logics.
We think we are wolves, living by the logic of the pack.
In truth we are sheep, living by the logic of the flock.
But it’s just the price I pay
It was only a kiss. Leave it to a Las Vegas band to write the best song ever about the most powerful other-regarding emotion — jealousy. That’s Laurence Fishburne as Othello on the left and Kenneth Branagh as Iago on the right, actors’ actors both.
There’s no way that a grown-up musical with Sesame Street puppets should work, butAvenue Qdoes. “Schadenfreude” is my favorite tune from the show, as well as the second-most powerful other-regarding emotion that drives our world.
Jukeboxes made a nice comeback when the user interface started showing you what other people had chosen to play, both in the past and coming up.
Once you start looking for the Jukebox Effect — the intentional effort to force you into other-regarding flock behavior — you see iteverywhere.

I’ve got an unexpurgated print of this card sitting on my desk. A prey animal like a rabbit would findWatership Downunrecognizable. Not because reality is any less dominated by fang and claw, but because the protagonists are protagonists, driven by independent will and self-regarding decision making. It’s a Hero’s Journey, which makes it a great read but poor rabbit socio-biology.
The movieBladerunnerwas based on the Philip K. Dick novella,Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and inherent in the question is the reason we root for the androids over the humans. It’s the same reason we root for Hazel and the other intrepid rabbits ofWatership Down. They’re dreaming and striving for a better life. They’re fighters. They have gumption.
In reality, neither sheep nor rabbits nor androids have gumption.

Such a vainglorious statement by such a preening man. Mussolini, that is. Find a film clip and watch how he uses his hands.
Our compliance departments require us to say that retweets are not endorsements. But of course they are.
The copycat phenomenon is real. As more and more notable and tragic events occur, we think we’re seeing more compromised, marginalized individuals who are seeking inspiration from those past attacks.
Mass shooters are not Lone Wolves. They are Lone Sheep.
Tom Junod atEsquirefeatured FBI agent Andre Simon in his must-read 2014 article, “A Radical New Look at Mass Shooters.” Three years later and we’re still having the wrong debate, focusing on gun control rather than mental health and intervention. Why? Because the gun control debate has enormous political efficacy for both the Left and the Right, where the mental health debate has none. Steve Bannon’s fondest dream is for Democrats to make Federal gun control a key issue in the 2020 electoral cycle. We are,YET AGAIN, being intentionally shepherded by political entrepreneurs into a pernicious Competitive Game of domestic identity politics.
Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
There’s no domesticated animal species that has had more of a reputational fall from grace than the sheep. To call someone a sheep today is just about the worst insult there is. To call someone a sheep is to call them stupid and — more pointedly — stupidly obedient and in thrall to some bad shepherd.
It wasn’t always this way. Jesus isn’t insulting you when He calls you a sheep. The point of all those Biblical allegories isn’t that sheep are stupidly obedient or easily led, but that the healthy life of a willful sheep requires a good shepherd.
Ask anyone who actually keeps sheep. Sheep are weird. Sheep are evolved to have a very different intelligence than humans. But sheep are not stupid. Sheep are not obedient. And sheep aredefinitelynot easily led.
Of course, no one except a dilettante farmer like me keeps sheep today, so all of the Old Stories about sheep and shepherds have lost their punch. They’ve all been diminished through the modern lens of sheep-as-idiot-followers.
Today most people dismiss the notion that good shepherds — i.e., individuals with expertise and wise counsel in some difficult to navigate field like … I dunno … investing — exist at all. And they utterly reject the idea that it’s actually okay not to have a fully formed and forcefully held opinion on anything and everything, that it’s not a sign of personal failure to say “I don’t know” and follow another’s lead.
It’s not just the media careers and media business models that are built on the notion of the Constant Hot Take — an unending stream of contrarian opinions expressed in the most incendiary way possible, solely for the entertainment value of contrarian opinions expressed in the most incendiary way possible — it’s themillionsof hours that so many non-media civilians will spend engaged on Twitter or Facebook or whatever to construct their own steady stream of Hot Takes and bon mot responses. All tossed out there like bottles into the vast social media ocean, never to wash up on any inhabited shore, lost in some great Sargasso Sea of impotent and forgotten texts.
Why? Why does @RandoBlueStateLawyer with 45 followers spend the better part of every afternoon thinking about his next brilliant riposte to the latest Republican Hot Take on Obamacare reform? Why does @RandoRedStateRetiree spend every evening working himself into a MAGA apoplexy that can only be sated by retweeting his 19,001stHannity blurb?
To answer that question, I want to go back to the Old Stories. I want to share with you what sheep are really like.
Sheep are evolved to have a specific type of intelligence which has the following hallmarks.
Enormous capacity for other-regarding behaviors.Sheep are unbelievably sensitive to what other sheep are doing and their emotional states. If another sheep is happy — i.e., it’s found a good source of food, which is the only thing that makes a sheep happy — then every other sheep in the flock is filled with jealousy (there’s really no other word for it) and will move in on that good thing. If another sheep is alarmed — which can be from almost anything, as bravery is not exactly a trait that tends to be naturally selected in a prey species — then every other sheep in the flock isimmediatelyaware of what’s going on. Sometimes that means that they get alarmed, too. As often, though, it’s just an opportunity to keep going with your own grazing without worrying about the alarmed sheep bumping into your happy place.
Zero altruism and overwhelming selfishness.The most popular misconception about sheep is that they are obedient followers. It’s true that they’re not leaders. It’s true that they are incredibly sensitive to other sheep. But it’s also true that they are the most selfish mammal I’ve ever encountered. They don’t lead other sheep or form leadership structures like a pack because they don’tcareabout other sheep. Every sheep lives in a universe of One, which makes them just about the most non-obedient creature around.
The determination to pursue any behavior that meets Hallmark #1 and #2 to absurd ends, even unto death.My worst sheep suicide story? The first year we kept sheep, we thought it would make sense to set up a hay net in their pen, which keeps the hay off the ground and lets the sheep feed themselves by pulling hay through the very loose loops of the net. Turned out, though, that the loops were so loose that a determined sheep could put her entire head inside the net, and if one sheep could do that, then two sheep could do that. And given how the hay net was hung and how these sheep were sensing each other, they started to move clockwise in unison, each trying to get an advantage over the other, still with their heads stuck in the net. At which point the net starts to tighten. And tighten. And tighten. My daughter found them the next morning, having strangled each other to death, unable to stop gorging themselves or seeking an advantage from the behavior of others. The other sheep were crowded around, stepping around the dead bodies, pulling hay for themselves out of the net. That was a bad day.
In both markets and in politics, our human intelligences are being trained to be sheep intelligences.
That doesn’t make us sheep in the modern vernacular. We are not becoming docile, stupid, and blindly obedient. On the contrary, we are becoming sheep as the Old Stories understood sheep … intensely selfish, intensely intelligent (but only in an other-regarding way) and intensely dogmatic, willing to pursue a myopic behavior even unto death.
Why are we being trained to think like sheep? Because sheep are wonderful prey animals. They pay the rent with their fleece, and when push comes to shove you can eat them, too. Plus they’re not helpless prey animals. Sheep are quite competent and rather self-sufficient prey animals, which from a smart owner’s perspective is really what you want. If sheep were truly docile and stupid, then they’d be way too much trouble to keep. Nope, with sheep you can let them wander around all day and do their thing. Just keep them from killing themselves in some really stupid accident and you can harvest them for years and years and years.
How are we trained to think like sheep? By the rewards we receive from our modern social institutions for other-regarding flock behaviors like jealousy (feeling sad when others are glad) and schadenfreude (feeling glad when others are sad), and by the penalties we receive for self-regarding pack behaviors like honor and shame. If you’ve ever kept a pack animal like a dog, you know how clearly they can experience a sense of shame, that feeling when you believe you’ve let the pack down through your personal failure. Sheep have no shame. Not a bit. Shame requires self-evaluation and self-judgment against some standard of obligation to the pack, concepts which would make sheep laugh if they could. Sheep are enormously other-aware, but never other-obliged. They’re high-functioning sociopaths, shameless creatures of jealousy and schadenfreude, which is exactly the type of human most purely designed to succeed in the modern age.
The mechanism for all this sheep training, particularly in our investment lives, is what game theory calls the Common Knowledge Game. Once you start noticing it, you will see iteverywhere.
I’ve written about the Common Knowledge Game a lot inEpsilon Theory, starting in the original “Manifesto” and continuing with notes like “A Game of Sentiment” and “When Does the Story Break”. But let’s review this core game of sheep logic one more time, with feeling. So here’s the classic thought experiment of the Common Knowledge Game — The Island of the Green-Eyed Tribe.
On the Island of the Green-Eyed Tribe, blue eyes are taboo. If you have blue eyes you must get in your canoe and leave the island the next morning. But there are no mirrors or reflective surfaces on the island, so you don’t know the color of your own eyes. It is also taboo to talk with each other about eye color, so when you see a fellow tribesman with blue eyes, you say nothing. As a result, even though everyone knows there are blue-eyed tribesmen, no one has ever left the island for this taboo. A Missionary comes to the island and announces to everyone, “At least one of you has blue eyes.”
Let’s take the trivial case of only one tribesman having blue eyes. He has seen everyone else’s eyes, and he knows that everyone else has green eyes. Immediately after the Missionary’s statement, this poor fellow realizes, “Oh, no! I must be the one with blue eyes.” So the next morning he gets in his canoe and leaves the island.
But now let’s take the case of two tribesmen having blue eyes. The two blue-eyed tribesmen have seen each other, so each thinks, “Whew! That guy has blue eyes, so he must be the one that the Missionary is talking about.” But because neither blue-eyed tribesman believes that he has blue eyes himself, neither gets in his canoe the next morning and leaves the island. The next day, then, each is very surprised to see the other fellow still on the island, at which point each thinks, “Wait a second … if he didn’t leave the island, it must mean that he saw someone else with blue eyes. And since I know that everyone else has green eyes, that means … oh, no! I must have blue eyes, too.” So on the morning of the second day, both blue-eyed tribesmen get in their canoes and leave the island.
The generalized answer to the question of “what happens?” is that for anyntribesmen with blue eyes, they all leave simultaneously on thenthmorning after the Missionary’s statement. Note that no one forces the blue-eyed tribesmen to leave the island. They leave voluntarily once public knowledge is inserted into the informational structure of the tribal taboo system, which is the hallmark of an equilibrium shift in any game. Given the tribal taboo system (the rules of the game) and its pre-Missionary informational structure, new information from the Missionary causes the players to update their assessments of where they stand within the informational structure andchooseto move to a new equilibrium outcome.
Before the Missionary arrives, the island is a pristine example of perfect private information. Everyone knows the eye color of everyone else, but that knowledge is locked up inside each tribesman’s own head, never to be made public. The Missionary does NOT turn private information into public information. He does not say, for example, that Tribesman Jones and Tribesman Smith have blue eyes. But he nonetheless transforms everyone’s private information into common knowledge. Common knowledge is not the same thing as public information.Common knowledge is information, public or private, that everyone believes is shared by everyone else.It’s the crowd of tribesmen looking around and seeing that the entire crowd heard the Missionary that unlocks the private information in their heads and turns it into common knowledge.
The important thing is not that everyone hears the Missionary’s words. The important thing is that everyone believes that everyone else heard the Missionary’s words, because that’s how you update your estimation of everyone else’s estimations (why didn’t that blue-eyed guy leave the island? I know he heard the news, too … hmm … but that must mean that he, too, saw a blue-eyed guy … hmm … oh, snap.).The power source of the Common Knowledge Game isthe crowd seeing the crowd, and the dynamic structure of the Common Knowledge Game is thedynamic structure of the flock. There’s no purposeful objective that animates a flock the way it does a pack, which is why you famously have people describing the “madness of crowds.” But it’s not madness, and it’s not chaos, either. A crowd is the communication mechanism for the Common Knowledge Game, with clear rules and strategies for playing and winning.
Understanding the Common Knowledge Game has been the secret of successful shepherds since time immemorial, in business, politics, religion … any aspect of our lives as social animals.The only difference today is that technological innovation provides a media toolkit for modern shepherds that the shepherds of the Old Stories could only dream of.
This is why sitcom laugh tracks exist. This is why performances, whether it’s an NFL game orDancing with the Stars, are filmed in front of a live audience. This is why the Chinese government still bans any internet pictures of the Tiananmen Square protests, with their massive crowds, more than 20 years after they occurred. This is what John Maynard Keynes called theNewspaper Beauty Contest, which he believed (and demonstrated) was the secret to successful investing through the 1930s. This is how Dick Clarkbuilt a massive fortune withAmerican Bandstand.He didn’ttellMiddle America what music to like; he got a crowd of attractive young people to announce what music they liked (“it’s got a good beat and you can dance to it, I give it a 94, Dick!”), and Middle America took its cues from that. Not only is that all you need to motivate sheep, it’sfarmore effective than any efforts at direct influence.
This is why executions used to be held in public and why inaugurations still are. This is why Donald Trump cared so much about the size of his inauguration crowd. This is why he’s always talking about the viewership and ratings of his televised appearances. Trump gets it. He understands what makes the Common Knowledge Game work.It’s not what the crowd believes. It’s what the crowd believes that the crowd believes.The power of a crowd seeing a crowd is one of the most awesome forces in human society. It topples governments. It launches Crusades. It builds cathedrals. And it darn sure moves markets.
How do we “see” a crowd in financial markets? Through the financial media outlets that are ubiquitous throughout every professional investment operation in the world — theWall Street Journal, theFinancial Times, CNBC, and Bloomberg. That’s it. These are the only four signal transmission and mediation channels that matter from a financial market Common Knowledge Game perspective because “everyone knows” that we all subscribe to these four channels. If a signal appears prominently in any one of these media outlets (and if it appears prominently in one, it becomes “news” and will appear in all), then every professional investor in the world automatically assumes that every other professional investor in the world heard the signal. So if Famous Investor X appears on CNBC and says that the latest Fed announcement is a great and wonderful thing for equity markets, then the market will go up. It won’t go up because investors agree with Famous Investor X’s assessment of the merits of the Fed announcement. The market will go up because every investor will believe that every other investor heard what Famous Investor X said, andevery investor will be forced to update his or her estimation of what every other investor estimates the market will do.It doesn’t matter what the Truth with a capital T is about the Fed. It doesn’t matter what you think about the Fed. It doesn’t matter what everyone thinks about the Fed.What matters is what everyone thinks that everyone thinks about the Fed.That’s how sheep logic, aka the Common Knowledge Game, works in markets.
So who owns us market sheep? The controllers of any Common Knowledge Game are the Missionaries, and the eternal Missionaries are the political executive and the market sell-side. Politicians and brokers have understood the power of this game for thousands of years, which makes the Street and the White House the constants as you examine the history of American sheepification. But they’re not the most powerful Missionaries of the modern age. No, that honor goes to our central bankers, relative newcomers to the Game, but quick studies all the same.
In hislast Jackson Hole address, Ben Bernanke extols the virtues of their “communication tools”, carefully constructed media messages designed to alter investor behavior, messages that he says have been their most effective policy tools to date. Interest rates may hit a lower bound of zero, and asset purchases may lose their punch, but investors can ALWAYS be “guided”. The architect of this new and powerful toolkit? Vice Chair Janet Yellen, natch.Forward guidance and what the Fed calls communication policy are the very definition of Missionary statements, and our utter absorption inwhat everyone believes that everyone believesabout the Fed’s impact on markets IS sheep logic.
Think that the Fed will go back to their old taciturn ways, content to let their actions speak louder than their words? Think again. Here’s Ben Bernanke again, this time in hisfinal speech as Fed Chair:
The crisis has passed, but I think the Fed’s need to educate and explain will only grow.When Paul Volcker first sat in the Chairman’s office in 1979, there were no financial news channel on cable TV, no Bloomberg screens, no blogs, no Twitter. Today, news, ideas, and rumors circulate almost instantaneously. The Fed must continue to find ways to navigate this changing environment while providing clear, objective, and reliable information to the public.
Active central bank Narrative construction in the service of their policy goals is a permanent change in our market dynamics.The introduction of such a powerful new weapon in the Fed’s policy arsenal can no more be removed than mustard gas or tanks could be removed from national arsenals after World War I. Market prices may be mean-reverting, but “innovation” in the service of social control never is.
What do the Missionaries get out of this? What’s our equivalent of wool and mutton? It’s low volatility. It’s the transformation of capital markets into a political utility, which is just about the greatest gift that status quo political interests can imagine. When Donald Trump and Steve Mnuchin talk about the stock market being their “report card”, they’re just saying out loud what every other Administration has known for years. Forget about markets, our entirepoliticalsystemrelies on stocks going up. If stocks don’t go up, our public pension funds and social insurance programs are busted, driving our current levels of wealth inequality from ridiculously unbalanced to Louis XVI unbalanced. If stocks don’t go up, we don’t have new collateral for our new debt, and if we can’t keep borrowing and borrowing to fuel today’s consumption with tomorrow’s growth … well, that’s no fun, now is it?
The flip side to all this, of course, is that so long as stocks DO go up, nothing big is ever going to change, You say you want a revolution? You’re a MAGA guy and you want someone to drain the Swamp? You’re a Bernie Bro and you want the rich to “pay their fair share”? Well, good luck with any of that so long as stocks go up. It’s a very stable political equilibrium we have today, full ofSturm und Drangto provide a bit of amusement and distraction, but very stable for the Haves.
And that brings us back to @RandoBlueStateLawyer and @RandoRedStateRetiree, fighting the good fight on Twitter or Facebook or wherever, speaking their Truth to their audience of dozens. They’re smart guys. Politically engaged guys. They’re angry about the mendacity of the Other Side. In another day and age they’d slam the newspaper down on the table and tell the dog what a fool that darn Truman was. Maybe write a strongly worded letter to the editor. But today they areconsumedby this modern equivalent of writing a letter to the editor. They areimmersedin the world of the Constant Hot Take, morning, noon and night. Why? Because Common Knowledge Game. Because they see a crowd responding to a crowd, and they are hard-wired to join in. Because it makes them feel good about themselves. Because they’ve been turned into other-regarding sheep even as they think they’re being self-regarding wolves.
In the same way that the modern story of what it means to be a sheep — docile, obedient, stupid — is totally wrong, so is the modern story of what it means to be a wolf. We think of a wolf as the epitome of rapacious independence, but wolves, like all pack animals, are far less independent (and far less greedy) than your average sheep. Unlike sheep, wolves can act outside of their group because they’re not consumed by other-regarding behavior, but those actions are ultimately in service to the pack. A sheep always acts within its group, but it’s never in service to the flock, only to its own needs.
Look, I’ll admit that I’m talking to myself as I write these words. I spend WAY too much time on Twitter, justifying it to myself in any number of ways, when in truth it’s the functional equivalent of a meth habit. At least it’s not as tough on the teeth. My wife is hooked on Facebook, my kids on god knows what social media platforms …. I’m not so nave as to think that the answer to our collective sheepification is just to put the devices down. No, we’ve got to shift the way we use this stuff, not quit it cold turkey.
So what do we do? We stop pretending to be fake wolves and we start acting like real ones.We stop acting like animals of the flock and we start acting like animals of the pack.We reject the other-regarding emotions of jealousy and schadenfreude. Yes, even in our tweets (gulp!). We embrace self-regarding emotions like honor and — here’s where I’m going to lose everyone — shame.
Yes, we need a lot more shame in the world. The loss of our sense of shame is, I think, the greatest loss of our modern world, where —to retweet myself—scale and mass distribution are ends in themselves, where the supercilious State knows what’s best for you and your family, where communication policy andfiat newsshout down authenticity, where rapacious, know-nothing narcissism is celebrated as leadership even as civility, expertise, and service are mocked as cuckery. Or to put it in sheep logic terms:the tragedy of the flock is thateverythingis instrumental, including our relationship to others. Including our relationship to ourselves.
Why do we need shame? Because with no sense of shame there is no sense of honor. There is no mercy. There is no charity. There is no forgiveness. There is no loyalty. There is no courage. There is no service. There is noCode. There are no ties that bind us ascitizens, as fellow pack members seeking to achieve something bigger and more important than our ability to graze on as much grass as we can. Something like, you know, liberty and justice for all.
Any coin worth having has two sides. A shameless politics has no honor. A riskless market has no reward. Oh, the Missionaries will tell you that there’s honor in the shameless politics and reward in the riskless markets, and for all the high-functioning sociopaths out there I’m sure that’s true, But if you’re not totally sheepified yet, if your goal is still honorable service to your clients or your partners or your family or your nation or your species — whatever your pack may be — then you know that this is NOT true. You know that shame and risk can be deferred or displaced but never wiped clean, no matter how many Supreme Court Justices you appoint and no matter how many all-time highs the stock market hits. You know that a reputation is like a tea cup; once broken you can glue it back together, but it will always be a broken tea cup. You know that the only game worth playing is the long game.
This is the Age of the High-Functioning Sociopath. This is the Age of Sheep Logic. We have to survive it, but we don’t have to succumb to it. How do we Resist? Not by switching out blue Missionaries for red Missionaries or red Missionaries for blue Missionaries. Not by switching out one bad shepherd for another bad shepherd. We don’t have to play that game! We resist by changing the System from below, by carving out local spheres of action where we arerelentlesslyhonorable and charitable,relentlesslyun-sheeplike. We resist byMaking America Good Again, one pack at a time, which is a hell of a lot harder than making America great ever was. We resist by doing right by our clients, even if that means getting slapped around by supposedly riskless markets and shameless politics. Even if that means losing clients. Even if that means losing our jobs.
A good shepherd once said that whoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. Of course, I also knew a good Dungeonmaster who said that being lawful good didn’t mean being lawful stupid, and turning the other cheek always seemed to be kinda stupid to me. Kinda sheeplike. But then I started keeping sheep, and my perspective changed. Sheep would never turn the other cheek. But a wolf would. A wolf would take a hit for the pack. It’s the smart play for the long game. As wise as serpents, you might say.
It’s time to be wolves. Not as devourers, but as animals that know honor and shame. It’s time to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. It’s time to remember the Old Stories. It’s time to find your pack.",1

"At this rate, Media will spend the next four years playing catch-up.
They use keywords and phrases to not just INFORM the public, but to INFLUENCE how they will react to the news they are hearing about.
We have seen hints that it’s all coordinated, too. Like the use of certain words (like the word ‘dark’) by nearly EVERY left-leaning news outlet to describe Trump’s speech at the GOP convention.
They don’t mention the seven nations covered by the Executive Order, for instance, without first inserting the leading phrase ‘Muslim-majority’. (Coincidence? Hell no.)
Historically, this tactic has been absolutely LETHAL to Republican politicians. The media attack machine, when unleashed, has a long line of ‘assassinated’ political careers. Again, not a coincidence.
They could use an innocent clumsy phrase, like ‘binders full of women’ as a cudgel to beat us down.
Then along came Trump.
Not only has he been completely impervious to their frenzied attacks — only Dubya has seen hysterical venom that has even come close to these levels — but he’s making them look like clowns.
They think they’re baiting him to destroy him… and (to continue the boxing analogy) wind up face own on the mat, wondering what hit them.
This time, for instance, they were pounding on him, like usual, over the travel ban.
He called them out for being fake news, saying they hadn’t given proper coverage to terror attacks. He issued a list of attacks they hadn’t covered adequately.
What did they do? The set to work ‘proving him wrong’.
The started talking about the terror attacks. It was beautiful.
The LEFT was playing defense by calling him a liar. See? We covered 74% of those attacks!
This gave the RIGHT an opportunity to point out that whenever there WAS an attack, the Left consistently moves heaven and earth to avoid connecting motive to Islam. Evidence be damned.
Result? When the motive for the travel ban was to protect Americans from dangerous countries… the antagonistic media spends whole news cycles discussing exactly WHICH dangers Trump is aiming to defend us from.
Share if the hostile media and other elites are EXACTLY why Americans voted Trump in the first place.",1
"The sudden shutdown and erasure of two groups of local-news sites Thursday provided Web users with an unpleasant reminder: The “memory hole” George Orwell wrote about in 1984lurks online, and any site’s owner can fire it up after firing a site’s staff.
Readers or writers of the New York and Chicago branches of DNAInfo, or any of the far-flung family of Gothamist sites (LAist, SFist) today find a link to any past news stories lands them on just one page: The announcement by owner Joe Ricketts that he was shutting the publications down.
But the Web also offers remedies for Ricketts’ removal of every story at those city-specific blogs a week after staffers at their NYC newsrooms voted to unionize.
One is the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. This San Francisco-based nonprofit’s frequently-updated database of old Web pages allows you to click through long-gone sites, often including their comments and some photos. You can also share those Archive links in e-mail, blog posts, tweets or anywhere else.
But while the Wayback Machine can be remarkably comprehensive—its collection of the Washington blog DCist includes 1,437 captures of pages from August 18, 2004 to Thursday—it lacks a search function.
To get around that, turn to Bing. No, not Google: That dominant search site doesn’t return direct links to pages in its search results, instead serving up much longer links that redirect through Google.
Click on a Gothamist or DNAInfo result at Google, and you’ll be instantly bounced to Ricketts’ message expressing his sadness at not being able to make money from “exceptional neighborhood storytelling.”
At Bing, you can right-click on a search result and then paste it into the Wayback Machine. You can also do this at Yahoo and DuckDuckGo, but those search sites don’t let you constrain a search to particular dates the way Bing does.
Google does, however, offer a different option that can help you read a vanished page for some time after its demise: the cached version it automatically collects, which you can view by clicking the green, downward-facing triangle below a result and selecting “Cached.”
But you can’t count on these records sticking around, because if Google thinks a site has outright vanished, it will eventually stop showing links to it in its search results. For example, Google no longer points to the posts I wrote in 2012 for the Consumer Technology Association’s blog that vanished after a site redesign the next year.
The abrupt annihilation of more than a decade of work sets Ricketts’ move apart from routine “link rot”: Internet Archive curator Jason Scott said in a Twitter direct message that he’s “almost never” seen so many posts vanish with zero warning.
More often, you should have some advance warning of a site’s shaky footing. In those cases, the Archive lets you add that page to its collection that it hasn’t already collected. If you paste in an address and the Archive reports that it doesn’t have a copy, click the “Save this url in the Wayback Machine” button at the bottom of the page.

"By now we have all heard about the tragic death of Seth Rich. Many people believe that he is responsible for leaking information on the corruption of the DNC.
It is clear that he was not robbed outside of his house. Rich was murdered in cold blood due to his connection with Wikileaks. The left has been blaming Russia, but that is all about to change due to a tweet by Kim Dotcom, a notorious hacker, who knew Seth. He says that Seth was the leaker. Now Kim Dotcom has tweeted that he’ll be releasing a FULL statement tomorrow to blow this wide open!
I'm meeting my legal team on Monday. I will issue a statement about #SethRich on Tuesday. Please be patient. This needs to be done properly.

The narrative that liberals have been pushing, a.k.a., “RUSSIA DID IT,” is going to disappear in a hurry. Kim Dotcom is going to shed some light on this case that is going to PROVE that the left has been trying to pull a fast one all along. He has something up his sleeve, and it seems to be serious.
He is likely working out the legal steps that he needs to take to prove that Seth Rich was the source for Wikileaks. In fact, before the previously mentioned tweet, he said that “I knew Seth Rich. I know he was the @Wikileaks source. I was involved.”
The truth is about to come to light, and we are thankful. Rich did not deserve to be murdered for covering up the horrendous acts of the DNC. He was only trying to do the right thing.
Once Kim Dotcom can finish the final touches on his claim, he is going to come forward and shut the left down forever. They are going to be proven once and for all to be frauds, and their opinion is going to become even more irrelevant in the eyes of the public.
We knew all along that there was something fishy going on here. It takes people like Kim to come forward and reveal information that they have tucked away to get the truth out there and in the open.
Liberal media has been looking for every reason under the sun to make President Trump’s life difficult. There have been multiple implications with Russia, all proven false.
Once Kim comes forward, this will not only prove their narrative wrong but will expose the liberals. You can bet that within the next couple of hours all talk of Russia and Trump is going to quiet down. By tomorrow, the left won’t have anything to say. Judgment day is coming for those who brought harm to Seth and others who sought and exposed the truth.
We cannot wait to see what information Kim has in store for the public. The lies are finally going to be put to rest. People who were involved in this are going to be punished, and Seth’s family can finally hear the truth. It has been a rough road, but the liberals are finally about to be completely unmasked.
Do YOU think that Kim Dotcom will finally put the last nail in the liberal’s coffin? Share this story on Facebook and let us know because we want to hear YOUR voice!

Editor's note:The following column originally appeared in The Washington Times.
How do you know when the liberal media meltdown is approaching an apex? Just look for apples, bananas and a strong smell of smug.
Reaching deep in their drawer of smug, CNN unleashed a “Facts First” initiative, starting with an ad featuring an apple, with a voice-over warning viewers that some awful, yet unnamed, person or network is trying to convince you the apple is a banana. While a juvenile attempt to discredit PresidentTrump’s complaints about the network’s shoddy news coverage, they manage only to remind us of why they’re in this fix in the first place.
What CNN reveals with this abject sanctimony is their contempt for the viewers themselves. “This is an apple. Some people might try to tell you that it’s a banana. They might scream banana, banana, banana, over and over and over again. They might put BANANA in all caps. You might even start to believe that this is a banana. But it’s not. This is an apple.” And then the words “Facts First” appear on screen.
This is 30 seconds of CNN condescendingly treating news consumers as idiots, unable to judge for themselves. Think about this: Someone at CNN thought it would be a great idea to suggest people who don’t trust CNN are either brainwashed or just plain stupid.
Think about this: Someone at CNN thought it would be a great idea to suggest people who don’t trust CNN are either brainwashed or just plain stupid.
They must be feeling very, um, special right around now as sole possessors of the truth, as a Harris Poll in May found that 65 percent of voters feel that fake news in the mainstream news media is a big problem.
From May 2017, The Hill reported, “Nearly two-thirds of Americans say the mainstream press is full of fake news, a sentiment that is held by a majority of voters across the ideological spectrum. According to data from the latest Harvard-Harris poll … 65 percent of voters believe there is a lot of fake news in the mainstream media. That number includes 80 percent of Republicans, 60 percent of independents and 53 percent of Democrats.”
And why might Americans (including the president) consider CNN fake news?
Consider some recent headlines: Huffington Post: “CNN mistakes sex toy flag for ISIS Flag at London gay pride.” Daily Mail: “CNN anchor mistakes Star-Spangled Banner for French national anthem.”
Federalist: “CNN producer fesses up: We’re just doing the Russia stuff for ratings.” Referring to the Project Veritas undercover video of a CNN producer, they reported, “When asked if he thought the Russia collusion story was legitimate or all hype, [John] Bonifield said it’s ‘mostly [expletive] right now.’
” ‘Like we don’t have any big giant proof,’ he said. ‘I think the president is probably right to say, like, “Look, you are witch-hunting me. You have no smoking gun. You have no real proof.” ‘ “
That looks an awful lot like a banana, no?
The New York Times referred to CNN as having a “unique role as nemesis forMr. Trump.” Really? Also The New York Times: “3 CNN journalists resign after retracted story onTrumpally.” A story with three reporters and one anonymous source. When the target of the hit piece, Anthony Scaramucci, threatened to sue, only then did the network retract and apologize.
I guess that’s what happens when you’re an official “nemesis” — your prize is a basket full of bananas.
And let’s not forget CNN hunting down and threatening a person on Reddit who created an anti-CNN WrestleMania gif, featuring PresidentTrumpwrestling a man (with a CNN logo head) to the ground. Yes, it was funny because it was a joke. Then CNN went … bananas.
The Hill reported on CNN’s bizarre reaction about the hunt for the person who dared to make fun of the network: “He is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again.” The story, titled “How CNN found the Reddit user behind the Trump wrestling GIF,” quotes from CNN.com: “CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.”
And that’s how #CNNBlackmail began to trend on Twitter. A senior reporter at Vox tweeted, “I can’t emphasize how bad this is on CNN’s part. This is basically ‘don’t post stuff we don’t like or we’ll dox you.’ Extremely unethical.” To say the least.
The Federalist reminds us of another CNN banana: “A banana is when you run conspiracy-mongering pieces that assert Republicans want to make rape and domestic violence pre-existing conditions in their Obamacare repeal bill when there is not a single word or action that backs up the allegation.”
CNN’s history is replete with getting things wrong. And then a producer gets caught on a hidden camera admitting that he knows what they’re promoting is bunk. And then you have three high-value journalists resign because a major story is insupportable and has to be retracted.
This is what happens when you decide to call your crusade against a politician you don’t like “news.” Sorta like calling an apple a banana.

"The most prominent bank in Germany is at risk of imminent collapse, with potentially profound effects for the EU, the United States and the rest of the world. The prospect of a cataclysmic global banking collapse of this nature has not been seen since the implosion of Lehman Brothers in 2008, and subsequent fallout in the global banking world.
But these events haven’t taken place in a vacuum, as earlier this year savvy international investor Lord Jacob Rothschild, during a semi-annual address to RIT Capital Partners, announced that they are reducing stock market and currency exposure and increasing their gold holdings, warning that the world is now in “uncharted waters” and the consequences are “impossible” to predict.
“The six months under review have seen central bankers continuing what is surely the greatest experiment in monetary policy in the history of the world.
We are therefore in uncharted waters and it is impossible to predict the unintended consequences of very low interest rates, with some 30% of global government debt at negative yields, combined with quantitative easing on a massive scale.”
The collapse of Deutsche Bank would most likely begin a cascade of Western banking institutions falling like dominos (which could include Barclays in London and CitiGroup in the U. S.). According to the same expert who valued Lehman’s worth at it’s collapse, Deutsche Bank’s current value of $1 trillion dollars is significantly more than Lehman Brothers’ valuation during their collapse in 2008.
The contagion from a collapse of this magnitude could potentially trigger a systemic banking collapse the likes of which the world has never seen. The EU would almost certainly disintegrate upon a collapse of this magnitude, as Deutsche Bank is the largest bank in Germany — which is essentially the financial heart and soul of the EU.
When Jacob Rothschild says that he is buying gold because the central banks are out of control, you begin to understand the scope and magnitude of what is transpiring, as his family has been in de facto control of the world’s central banks for centuries.
Deutsche Bank shares have fallen sharply on the news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel won’t bail out the struggling bank, with shares falling by as much as six percent in early week trading, turning in their worst performance since 1992. Since just January, the bank’s shares have lost over 52 percent of their value.
Merkel has also refused to provide state financial assistance to Deutsche Bank in its legal battle with the U. S. Department of Justice. The chancellor made her position clear during talks with Deutsche CEO John Cryan, according to Focus magazine. The German-based lender may be fined up to $14 billion over its mortgage-backed securities business before the 2008 global crisis.
The German Chancellor also noted that Deutsche Bank will not be getting a bailout from the European Central Bank – the lender of last resort for European banks.
Revealing the truly dangerous threat the German mega-bank poses to the international banking system, a report from the International Monetary Fund in June implied that Deutsche Bank was a systemic risk to the global financial system.
Of all the world’s big banks, the I. M.F. said,
“Deutsche Bank appears to be the most important net contributor to systemic risks.”
Many fear that in the wake of Merkel’s refusal to bail out Deutsche Bank, Germany may now be considering a bail-in instead?
A bail-in is rescuing a financial institution on the brink of failure by making its creditors and depositors take a loss on their holdings. A bail-in is the opposite of a bail-out, which involves the rescue of a financial institution by external parties, typically governments using taxpayers money. Typically, bail-outs have been far more common than bail-ins, but in recent years after massive bail-outs some governments now require the investors and depositors in the bank to take a loss before taxpayers.
Essentially, this entails the bank stealing deposited funds, with virtually no recourse for those individuals who have their savings stolen.
It’s not at all beyond the realm of possibility, as it has happened before in very recent history. To keep the bank solvent, the Bank of Cyprus took almost 40 percent of depositor’s funds – leaving customers with essentially nothing they could do about having their money stolen. Assets were frozen and ATM machines were not refilled.
Perhaps this explains why in mid-August Germans were told by their government to stockpile 10 days worth of water, and five days worth of food in case of a “national emergency” hitting the country, with the Czech Republic following suit and making a similar announcement within days of the German warning.
Deutsche Bank’s unbelievably risky portfolio and its exposure to the derivative markets, which stands at over $40 trillion dollars, would undoubtedly cause exponentially more damage than the Lehman Brothers collapse did back in 2008, which precipitated the Great Recession of 2008.
This risk of failure has now gotten so threatening that a number of funds that clear derivatives trades with Deutsche Bank AG have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the lender, according to Bloomberg.
While the vast majority of the bank’s more than 200 derivatives-clearing clients have made no changes, the hedge funds run on cash highlights serious concern. The paranoia of an imminent collapse spread to the US on Thursday, as 10hedge funds that are Deutsche Bank clients have decided to withdraw cash and listed derivatives positions from the bank, according to a Bloomberg News report.
Millennium Partners, Capula Investment Management and Rokos Capital Management are among about 10 hedge funds that have cut their exposure, said a person familiar with the situation who declined to be identified talking about confidential client matters.
The hedge funds use Deutsche Bank to clear their listed derivatives transactions because they are not members of clearinghouses. Millennium, Capula and Rokos declined to comment when contacted by phone or e-mail.
Highlighting the contagion banking effect, news that some hedge funds were pulling positions and excess collateral from Deutsche Bank caused shares of U. S. banks to quickly reverse early gains, according to Bloomberg.
Just as Lehman Brothers disingenuously claimed they were financially solvent as the upcoming financial storm brewed in 2008, only to file for bankruptcy, Deutsche Bank has attempted to allay investor concerns by claiming that their financial fundamentals are sound. One would be wise to be very suspicious of any statements made by a failing banking institution.
When the government warnings start, you can be assured that it’s already too late, as the availability of supplies in the case of emergency would be severely constrained after a warning due to the large number of people attempting to procure an extremely limited amount of supplies.
Will Germany become the powder keg that implodes the global economy? Only time will tell, but all signs point to a very similar situation to 2008 — but without central banks having much recourse, as negative interest rates and quantitative easing were some of the last arrows in the quiver being used to prop up the global economy.
What is certain is that an ounce of prevention, ahead of any potential collapse, is the most viable solution for those looking to safeguard themselves and their families. The key is to stock up on food, water and other necessities in advance of the actual crisis fully manifesting. A minimal amount of effort put into preparing early for the side effects of a major economic disaster could be the difference between surviving the crisis, or not, for your family.
Please share this extremely important information to help others be prepared for this potentially dangerous crisis, the severity of which is largely being covered up by mainstream media!",1
"Facebook has been besieged with demands that it fix its “fake news” problem, which became politically charged during the election season and was especially effective at propagating false right-wing news, according to BuzzFeed analysis. Mark Zuckerberg announced on Friday the steps that Facebook will take to combat fake news.
False news reporting will not be the only news outlets to feel the wrath of the social media giant. It seems that alternative medicine, along with Christian-based belief websites will also be put into the “fake news” category. On Friday, we were left with this statement:
“Fake news has been a problem for many years, and we plan to combat these issues specifically. Facebook will no longer tolerate any type of reporting that is unable to be documented with facts. This includes websites that report malicious “news”, theories that alternative medicine can cure diseases, and anything to do with the tales of Christianity which have solely been followed by “faith” not facts. We will begin to penalize any and all Facebook pages that post these shenanigans.”
Mark Zuckerberg plans to phase out these false reporting from Facebook in 2017",1
"The bigwigs at 21st Century Fox know there'll be ratings hell to pay if they decide to pull the plug on conservative talk show host Sean Hannity because of his reporting on the Seth Rich murder.
Rumors of his possible removal from the Fox News Channel appear to have been just that - rumors.
“Like the rest of the country, Sean Hannity is taking a vacation for Memorial Day weekend and will be back on Tuesday,” the Fox News Channel said in a statement. “Those who suggest otherwise are going to look foolish.”
Hannity has been catching a lot of liberal flak lately following the story's recent airing.
According to Worldnet Daily, the Seth Rich murder that conservative news sites considered a ""bombshell"" story didn't even register a ""blip"" on the screens at CNN, ABC or CBS:
""All three of the networks completely ignored the revelations by a private investigator that DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was shot dead last July while walking home from a bar, had leaked more than 44,000 internal DNC emails to WikiLeaks before his death.
NBC News did carry an article about the revelations but appeared more interested in debunking the story than investigating its accuracy: “DNC Staffer’s murder draws fresh conspiracy theories,” stated the NBC headline.
The New York Times and Washington Post also passed on the Seth Rich story Tuesday, with nothing on their websites about it as of Tuesday afternoon.""
In the meantime, Hannity said he is going easy on the story out of respect for Seth Rich's family. However, he is standing by the facts that he reported.
“There’s nothing that I did, nothing that I said, except they don’t like my position politically,” he said. “They’ll try to ratchet up the intensity of their rationale. It does not justify an attempt to get me fired. And that’s what this is. This is an attempt to take me out. This is a kill shot.”
To put it mildly, the Seth Rich story is as deadly to the Democratic Party as weapons grade plutonium.
If and when the story is properly investigated, the facts should prove that it was DNC insiders, rather than ""Russian hackers,"" who were behind the passing of information to Wikileaks.
Please share your comments on Facebook and Twitter if you think Sean Hannity should continue reporting on the Seth Rich murder despite the risk of losing his job at Fox News.",1
"Missing Las Vegas security guard, Jesus Campos, has been spotted reemerging from a clinic in Los Angeles famous for it’s MK Ultra brainwashing program.
According to Campos’ spokesperson, Campos had checked into the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for“psychological assistance” after suffering from a bout of PTSD shortly after he was due to appear on Fox News to spill the beans on what really happened during the mass shooting.
The Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center is a place many celebrities go when they need “reprogramming” after having a public breakdown.Kanye West was rushed there last year shortly after he outed Jay Z as a member of the illuminati.
It was also home to top mind control programmer,Louis Jolyon “Jolly” West, who carried out hisMK Ultraworkas late as 1989:
Between 1974 and 1989, West received at least $5,110,099 in grants from the federal government, channeled through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), a major funding conduit for CIA programs. Many millions more poured into the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute that West headed, including over $14 million in federal funds in one fiscal year before he stepped down.
Campos’ sudden disappearance caused widespread concern after he failed to turn up for an appearance on the Sean Hannity show, with friends, family and security refusing to tell reporters his whereabouts.
Suspicion grew when MGM Resorts International – the company that owns the Mandalay Bay hotel – coompletely erased his information from their employee database.
Daily Mail reports: His union representative revealed on Saturday that Campos was taken to a clinic shortly afterwards but he did not know which.
‘Right now I’m just concerned where my member is, and what his condition is. It’s highly unusual.
‘I’m hoping everything is OK with him and I’m sure MGM or the union will let (media) know when we hear something,’David Hickey is the president of the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America, toldFox 5 Vegas.
Campos was pictured for the first time on Friday as he accepted an award from the union.
According to the latest timeline provided by police detailing the events of October 1, Paddock sprayed 200 rounds into the hallway on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, wounding Campos in the leg, six minutes before he unleashed his barrage of bullets on the crowd attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival.
Campos, who was unarmed, survived the shooting and was scheduled to sit down for five TV interviews Thursday night, including one onFox News, but suddenly vanished.
ABC News reporter Stephanie Wash tweeted Thursday, quoting the president of Campos’ labor union: ‘We were in a room & we came out & he was gone.’
She followed up by writing that Campos’ whereabouts were unknown.
The security guard was supposed to be interviewed by Fox News’ Sean Hannity, but the host tweeted on Thursday: ‘He cancelled.’
Campos’ disappearance came just hours after MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay, disputed the official timeline of the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, rejecting any suggestion that hotel staff delayed calling 911 for six minutes after Paddock opened fire.
The latest chronology raised a series of questions about whether officers were given information quickly enough to possibly have a chance to take out the gunman before he could carry out the bloodshed.
But according to resort officials, it was no more than 40 seconds between the time Campos used his walkie talkie to call for help and Paddock opening fire on the crowd from two windows in his suite.
Earlier in the investigation, police had said that Paddock shot through his door and wounded Campos after the guard distracted him from firing on the crowd out the windows.
Campos’ union president said the latest timeline does not dispute the assertion that the guard is ‘still a hero, saving his coworker, possibly stopping additional shots,’ reported Stephanie Wash.",1

Breaking down the good and the bad with Trump's tax plan
This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" October 11, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.
BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Let's get some analysis of this pitch. Let's bring in the panel: Charles Hurt, opinion editor for The Washington Times; A. B. Stoddard, associate editor at RealClearPolitics and host of ""No Labels Radio"" on SiriusXM and Tom Rogan, commentary writer for The Washington Examiner. By the way, welcome to Washington. This is ""Special Report.""
And Charlie, it is -- it was classic President Trump on this page but clearly they are trying to emphasize the middle-class part of the pitch.
CHARLES HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Yes. This is by far the most populist presidency that we've had in certainly modern times. I don't ever remember a president campaigning or hosting an event with long-haul truck drivers. If there are people who fall in the category of being forgotten then in politics, they would deftly be some of them.
I've also never heard a president walk offstage to Creedence Clearwater, Suzie Q. All those things. I'm in favor of all of these things by the way. But I think, two other things that I think sort of interesting. One is clearly this is -- that President Trump wants to own the news cycle, and I think it's where we're going to see going forward as he gears up for reelection.
He wants -- he started his speech at 5:50 in the afternoon. Obviously, he wanted to own the time period and he wants to go around the media and talk directly to people. The second thing obviously, he's in Pennsylvania. He's going after Bob Casey who is up for reelection.
HURT: The Democrat who is -- in a state that Trump won. And he is clearly trying to send those signals that he aims to fight for his agenda in places like that.
BAIER: A.B., he turned to the lawmakers in the crowd and talking about tax reform, saying you better pass it.
BAIER: And then saying they will. Let's just talk about the reality of this. Fox Business Network had an interview with Kevin Brady, chairman of House Ways and Means Committee about the timing. Take a listen to this.
REP. KEVIN BRADY, R-TEXAS: The pivot is when they agree on a budget and giving us that firm baseline for tax reform. We will go immediately after that layout, let's call the chairman Marco. What it means is the Ways and Means Committee comprehensive tax reform plan with all the details. Then we'll begin the mark up in committee and house acts.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But as soon as that could happen would be the last week of October, first week of November?
BRADY: Yes. So I learned a long time ago not to plot out timing in House moving (ph) these things go. But that would be the perfect timing going forward.
BAIER: So again, end of October, beginning of November. And to just to kind of parse that further, the budget lays down exactly the numbers they can deal with and then tells them what they can negotiate on the specific percentages.
STODDARD: Right. And all of that squabbling is going on behind closed doors right now. You have the president trying -- he is previously said in the middle-class miracle he's trying to make the pitch that this is going to be deep middle-class focused tax relief plan.
And all of those battles that occur from the rift between the conservative wing of the party and the sort of less deficit-focused wing of the party are going on right now. And as long as you have people like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky saying if this provides a hit to the middle-class, a tax hike, you're not going to get my vote, that's why these next couple weeks are so pivotal, because they are really not at the details yet. There are many people that can still make the case that this is going to favor the wealthy and it's not going to be fair enough and helpful enough to the middle-class. And that's all being kept quite quiet, but it's a heated debate right now.
BAIER: The House Tea Party caucus has moved forward, and they have said we're going to support this framework. They have moved forward with the budget. The real question is in the Senate and what that all looks like. There are only 30 legislative days left before the end of the year.
TOM ROGAN, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: And I think you see the president today with this address, clearly it's about rejuvenating himself. You see how much fun he has with it. The hinting of rockets, whether it's Kim Jong-un or something else.
But also I think that moment in the White House, they need a legislative victory. They are running out of time. And when you get into the details of things like a state and local tax deduction and whether you can get something through without alienating Republican members in the northeast of the country, there's complexity and a limited window.
BAIER: There's a FOX News poll, Charlie, that says how important is it for Congress to pass tax reform this year. And it says extremely, 22 percent, very, 30 percent, somewhat 28 percent. In other words, people want to see something.
HURT: Absolutely. And I think A.B. is exactly right. The problem we're going to see, much like we saw with health care, is going to be between Republicans, more conservative Republicans and moderate Republicans.
But the Republican leadership has to understand that they are facing a situation yet again where if they don't figure out a way to come together and come up with something and work with Donald Trump on this, Donald Trump will walk across the aisle and try to negotiate something with Democrats. And obviously that makes it a lot trickier for a lot of reasons in terms of leadership and getting Congress to do stuff. But Donald Trump is not an ideologue on this stuff. And I think Republicans make a huge error in not doing everything they can to bring people together and get something done.
BAIER: OK, panel, thank you.

"(N. Morgan)Beforeitsnews.com is the last frontier of free press, open to the public to share news and information that is important to them.
In the video below you are about to see Mainstream Media try to tear down Donald Trump for using a graphic chart, found on beforeitsnews.com, displaying contributions to the Hillary Clinton Foundation and the countries that the donations came from, no doubt MSM wanted to keep this hidden from the public.
CNN’s Brian Stelter goes on to claim B4IN does not vet their articles, while providing no evidence that the information obtained by the Trump Campaign through beforeitsnews.com was false.
Free Press allows the user to determine the validity of an article, most of beforeitsnews.com users can distingush between fact and fiction, when they have doubts they do a little research, as everyone should research every report from all news agencies, especially mainstream media that spreads government propaganda as we have all witnessed during the lastest presidential campaign.
The story goes on to highlight additional instances where the truth was suppressed in favor of the false story which the White House wanted to release to the world.
It shows how Government and media conspire together to hide negative tales from the public, keeping them in the dark totally, and when that is not possible, crafting a cover story to deliberately keep us deceived of the facts.
Notice how the commentator despritely tries to get the guest to add validity to his claim that beforeitsnews.com is a fringe website, but to no avail.
The guest will not give him the satisfaction to discredit beforeitsnews.com.
CNN Questions Trump’s Use Of Creepy, Fringe Websites For ‘Sources’ Of News
But a look back at reports which first appeared here on Before It’s News have been proven to be true, even while the mainstream media was denying everything.
Numerous stories were presented focused on sharing how the Mainstream Media was dedicated on spoon feeding the public news which was skewed to not give the truth but give the viewer only what the government and corporate leaders wanted their media partners to say.
This one titled, “CNN Exposed, Emmy Winning Former CNN Journalist, Amber Lyon Blows the Whistle,
Let Me Repeat That:
CNN Is Paid by the US Government for Reporting on Some events, and Not Reporting on Others.
The Obama Administration Pays for CNN Content“, was published in October 2012.
It focused on a CNN international news report which showed the truth of events in Egypt at that time.
But because the video coverage did not agree with the report from the Obama Administration, and the Hillary Clinton State Department, the truth was suppressed, the video never shown to the public.
The story goes on to highlight additional instances where the truth was suppressed in favor of the false story which the White House wanted to release to the world.
Another story published in August 2012 was titled, “Pens Of Mass Destruction“, and expanded on how the biased position of the current media was historically grounded in the practices which had been introduced in the 1930s, with the infiltration of the American press and educational institutions by Communists.
The historical steps used to achieve the Communist goals for keeping the citizens away from the truth work just a well to keep the public blind to the events currently happening in 2012.
It shows how Government and media conspire together to hide negative tales from the public, keeping them in the dark totally, and when that is not possible, crafting a cover story to totally keep us deceived of the facts.
During the same year of 2012, Before It’s News stepped forward and published an article on the business of selling fetus body parts, something the Mainstream Media was not about to report.
This quiet business went on behind the scenes and was very shocking when our site presented the story to the public.
The story was bold and revealing.
It was also brought to light that a government authorized and approved human embryonic stem cell line was being used by companies who manufactured processed food products.
While the finished and stocked items contained no human embryonic stem cells, they had been used during the testing of the color and taste additives used in each product.
BecauseBeforeitsnewsis free press, we get reports from insiders and whistle blowers from all across the country who share their concerns with the public, thusbeforeitsnews.comoften is labelled as a conspiracy website, when in fact our insiders are 2 to 3 years ahead of the crowd as displayed above.
As you can see from the above examples, mainstream media is not able to compete with alt websites like beforeitsnews.com so they resort to tearing down the last frontier of free press to lend themselves credibility.
We have no qualms about our competitors tactics for we understand how desperate they are to control what facts the public are allowed to see and what perception the public will take away from the information presented to them.

"LONDON — Russians have “set up shop” in Scotland as it weighs a vote on independence from the U. K., a senator warned Wednesday at a congressional inquiry into the role of Google, Twitter, and Facebook in election interference.
“It’s not only us it’s the entire West,” Sen. Angus King, I-ME, told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which is investigating Russia-linked propaganda on social media in the 2016 election.
More than 150 million Americans were exposed to Russia-linked material on Facebook and its sister platform, Instagram, in the run-up to President Donald Trump’s victory, the tech giant admitted during Wednesday’s evidence.
King told the hearing that Russian “information warfare” was not limited to the United States and was ongoing.
“It hasn't stopped and it won't stop,” he said. “It’s still happening. We know the Russians were involved in the French election. We know that they were involved in the German elections.""
King added: “We are now learning they were involved in the separation of Spain. And my understanding is they've set up shop in Scotland which is talking about an independence vote from Great Britain. So this is a sophisticated worldwide strategy that applied here in 2016.”
He did not elaborate on his comment about Scotland, but he may have been referring to the 2015 creation of a new base in Edinburgh for Kremlin-owned media outlet, Sputnik.
A senior British lawmaker said Thursday he would demand answers from Facebook on whether Russians were using the social network to sow discord in Scotland.
Damian Collins, chairman of a British parliamentary committee that is already investigating fake news and Russian online propaganda, said: ""We are interested in any political activity on Facebook in the U. K. which has been driven by Russian-backed organizations. We will certainly be asking Facebook about this as part of our inquiry into the power of fake news to disrupt our democracy.""
Britain's Electoral Commission is reportedly already investigating whether Russia interfered in the 2016 Brexit vote that rocked the European Union.
However, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Wednesday said he had seen no evidence of Russian interference in British elections or referendums so far.
“I haven’t seen any evidence of that,” he told a committee of British lawmakers. “Not a sausage ... nyet, nyet, nyet.”
Lawmakers believe Russian internet trolls are using divisive issues in other nations in order to magnify social conflict and weaken governments.
In September, Facebook acknowledged hundreds of fake accounts, probably run from Russia, spent about $100,000 on ads aimed on issues such as gun control and race relations during the 2016 U. S. presidential election. Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) also said Russian troll farms were hashtagging ""take a knee"" and ""boycott NFL"" to amplify the NFL protest issue. He said the effort involved ""taking both sides of the argument"" to increase divisiveness in the country.
Formerly known as Voice of Russia, Sputnik says it “covers global political and economic news targeting an international audience,” and has repeatedly denied it is trying to destabilize the U. K.
However, the Center for European Policy Analysis says Sputnik emphasizes an anti-establishment narrative “to contribute to the flow of disinformation and pro-Russian messaging.”
Sputnik is currently recruiting a broadcast journalist in Edinburgh, according to a job description that says the agency “will give an alternative perspective on the news affecting people’s lives in the U. K.”",0

Kimberly Guilfoyle told the newspaper she’d be willing to take a pay cut and move to Washington for a possible White House job.  | AP Photo
Despite her telling a California newspaper that she has discussed taking a job with the administration, Fox News says host Kimberly Guilfoyle is under a ""long term"" contract and won't be going anywhere. ""Kimberly is a valued member of the FOX News primetime lineup, and is under a long-term contract with the network,"" a network spokesperson said in a statement. As POLITICO reported in December, Guilfoyle was being considered for the job of press secretary during the transition, a job which ultimately went to Sean Spicer. Guilfoyle's name was floated in a New York Times report as a person President Donald Trump had suggested to associates he’d be interested in hiring. Then, on Tuesday, the Bay Area News Group published an interview with Guilfoyle, part of a larger profile, where the former attorney confirmed she had spoken with the White House about a possible job. ""I’m a patriot, and it would be an honor to serve the country,” Guilfoyle said. “I think it’d be a fascinating job. It’s a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position.” According to a source with direct knowledge of the situation, Guilfoyle’s contract was renegotiated when the show she co-hosts, ‘The Five’ was moved to 9p.m. following the departure of anchor Bill O’Reilly and a shakeup of the primetime lineup. It’s not clear if the contract was re-signed well before Guilfoyle’s remarks to the Bay Area News Group or after. A Fox executive said Guilfoyle did not re-negotiate her contract in the wake of O’Reilly’s departure and that she signed a long-term deal prior to this.”

Guilfoyle told the newspaper she’d be willing to take a pay cut and move to Washington for a possible White House job. “I’ve never been someone who’s motivated by financial interests,” she said. “I really don’t think of that in terms of any obstacle — if you’re passionate about it and you feel like you have a calling for anything in life.” “I really love what I do, and this job is tough to beat,” she continued. “At the same time, life is exciting and it’s about different chapters in your life, so I’m excited about the future.” Through a spokesperson, Guilfoyle said on Tuesday: “As I stated in the interview, I really love what I do and my job co-hosting The Five is tough to beat.”",0
"Liberals were pissed when Trump tweeted “Chicago murder rate is record setting – 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can’t do it he must ask for Federal help!” Liberal news networks attacked Trump for this, they called him a racist, but it turns out that Trump was right.
Chicago Police Board Chairwoman Lori Lightfoot, admitted that if Chicago wants to improve, then they will need Trump’s help. “We need to have more federal gun prosecutions in Chicago. Our federal partners from the U. S. attorney’s office, the ATF, the FBI need to be much more invested in this overall strategy. Chicago Police Department cannot tackle this issue by itself,” started Lightfoot.
“This is not a problem that we’re going to arrest our way out of. We’re dealing with a huge re-entry problem – literally thousands of people coming back from the Illinois Department of Corrections to the same communities that they left, and those communities just don’t have the resources right now to absorb that huge influx of re-entry,” she continued.
“So we’ve got to tackle that problem. It’s not sexy. It’s not popular, but if we’re going to really get at the root causes of a lot of this gun violence, we’ve got to deal with these issues as well,” she said.
“In Chicago, we are in a state of crisis. We need all hands on deck,” continued Lightfoot. Do you think she is right? Check out the full interview here.",1

Right-wing rocker and gun enthusiast Ted Nugent thinks more military-grade weapons on the streets could have stopped the Las Vegas shooting.
In an interview on NRA TV, Nugent said that if he had a rocket launcher he could have stopped Stephen Paddock’s gun massacre.
“If we were allowed to walk around with things like rocket launchers this would have never happened,” said Nugent. “If I had one at the scene, I could have taken him out from the street.”
However, Nugent isn’t the only right-winger to engage in delusional thinking about gun violence.FOX News contributor Erick Ericksonclaimed that gun violence wasn’t a problem in the United States, even though it claims about 30,000 lives a year.
“But a lot of these statistics that the Senator (Chris Murphy) and others are using, because mass shootings in this country are actually so rare and on the decline, they’ve had to rig the statistics to make it worse than it is,” said Erickson.
Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise seemed to side with Nugent, even though he has just recovered from being shot by James Hodgkinson, a Bernie Sanders supporter. Scalise still thinks the country needs more weapons to protect against gun violence and claimed the media was covering up stories about gun owners who successfully defend themselves.
“Every single day in America, regular citizens that just have a passionate belief in the Second Amendment that have their own guns use guns every single day to protect themselves against criminals,” said Scalise in aFOX News interview.“Those stories never get told or hardly ever get told. That’s a different side of the story that I think is important.”
South Dakota Rep. John Thuneblamed the victims for not protecting themselves.
“I think people are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions,” said Thune in a MSNBC interview. “To protect themselves. And in situations like that, you know, try to stay safe. As somebody said — get small.”",1

"Following an exposé by James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas, organizers of plans to disrupt Donald Trump’s inaugural ceremony have reportedly decided to dramatically scale back earlier plans for massive road blocks and other mischief.
An organizer for extremist group DisruptJ20 now insists that recent undercover videos showing members of the group planning all manner of illegal acts don’t really reflect their plans. The organizer says its activities were “intentionally overstated” on the video, according to US News and World Report.
Indeed, organizer Legba Carrefour is attempting to sell the idea that his group was engaging in what might be considered a “rope-a-dope” play by wildly overplaying its plans for the videographers and other news outlets in order to sow chaos through disinformation.
“By virtue of us making those claims, it whips people up into the kind of panic that accidentally ends up causing the chaos we want. You can say ‘all of Metro is being blockaded’ and people will stay home,” the anarchist now says.
Videos of the group’s plans were unveiled by Project Veritas over the last few days.
O’Keefe’s videos added detail to an earlier story by the Washington Examiner’s Ryan Lovelace, whose article, “How protesters plan to wreck Donald Trump’s inauguration,” revealed the plans of #DisruptJ20 to cause trouble during the inaugural ceremony.
Reporting and the O’Keefe videos revealed such plans as shutting down D. C.’s Metro mass transportation system, various highways and roads, and plans to throw caustic chemical bombs among people attending the day’s events.
But now Carrefour is claiming their plans have changed.
“The reason a lot of our plans are pared down is that stuff we wanted to blockade is already being shut down,” Carrefour said. “This is definitely a different beast in the amount of the city that is being shut down.”
Carrefour even tried to take credit for the street closures, saying that the only reason they were closed down was because of their threats.
The anarchist leader also claimed he isn’t bothered by being outed by the O’Keefe videos.
“They have nothing on me that I would not feel comfortable talking about in front of the police. Don’t care,” he claimed.",1
"Irondale, Ala., Nov 8, 2017 / 09:39 am (CNA/EWTN News).- The National Catholic Register is turning 90 this year, an anniversary its editor-in-chief sees as a blessing, and an opportunity to move forward in service to the Church.
“The Register’s mission from its earliest days has been to inform and form our readers so that Catholics, through knowledge of the truth of Christ and his Church, might be inspired by faith and equipped to engage the culture around them,” said Jeanette DeMelo, editor-in-chief of the National Catholic Register.
“Our love of Christ and his Church drives us to continue this mission started back in 1927,” DeMelo told CNA.
One of the top online and print Catholic newspapers in the United States, the National Catholic Register was founded in 1927 by Msgr. Matthew Smith of the Archdiocese of Denver, with the mission of providing news through the lens of the Magisterium.
The paper was an outgrowth of the Archdiocese of Denver’s Register, which grew into the Register System of Newspapers, producing 35 diocesan editions, with a national and diocesan circulation which at its height reached 850,000 households.
The National Catholic Register’s first national issue was printed on Nov. 8, 1927.
“If you like a Catholic paper with snap, vigor, courage, here it is. If you like one that is easy to read, here it is. If you like one that will always be loyal to the Church and has no selfish axe to grind, here it is,” wrote Msgr. Smith in one of the paper’s first issues.
Decades after Msgr. Smith’s comments, DeMelo hopes their founder’s words still stand true.
“I hope that in our pages (both in print and online), Register readers find that at 90, we still have ‘snap, vigor and courage,’ as we take a ‘definite stand on stirring questions’ of the day,” DeMelo said.
The Register has an active online and print readership, producing daily online content and 26 print issues annually.
In June, the National Catholic Register was named this year’s “Newspaper of the Year” by the Catholic Press Association at the annual Catholic Media Conference in Quebec City, Canada.
“That’s a wonderful confirmation of what we do and strengthens us to keep at it,” DeMelo said of the award.
In 2011, EWTN Global Catholic Network acquired the National Catholic Register. In 2012, DeMelo was appointed the Register’s editor-in-chief.
“I have long admired the work of the National Catholic Register. And I appreciate it even more since I became its publisher six years ago, because I get to see first-hand what goes into the product and the care the staff takes in presenting the news,” stated EWTN Chairman and CEO Michael Warsaw, who also is the Register’s publisher, in the Oct. 29 edition of the newspaper, which features special anniversary coverage.
“The Register has always relayed the news of the world through the lens of the Church, but also chronicles the personal stories of struggle, conversion and redemption, as exemplified by Christ’s sacrifice,” Warsaw continued.
Since EWTN’s acquisition of the National Catholic Register, the paper’s circulation has increased by 100 percent.
“That’s a figure that represents the paper’s highest circulation in 17 years,” DeMelo noted, adding that they have also expanded their digital platforms, where they reach their largest audiences via NCRegister.com, a weekly and daily e-newsletter and their Facebook page, which has a monthly reach of 1.8 million.
Looking ahead, DeMelo has some goals for the next decade.
“As I looked through our archives I realized they are in terrible shape,” she said. “We need to get them digitized soon. We should make our archives available to anyone so I hope we can accomplish that before we turn 100.”
On a broader scale, she also looks forward to increasing collaboration with EWTN entities worldwide.
“Being a part of a global network is a wonderful gift,” she said, “and as EWTN builds its news division, opportunities are bound to be not simply national but international, offering not only printed news and analysis, but a compelling and complementary mix of multimedia that strengthens our mission to form and inform readers in faith so they might engage in the world.”

WHEN CNN CALLS YOU OUT FOR FAKE NEWS YOU NOW YOU BAD : CNN host BRIAN STELTER Calls out Joe Scarborough FOR ""Fake News"" (VIDEO)
CNN’s S. E. Cupp and Brian Stelter cast doubt on firday over Joe Scarborough’s claims that Trumphas been using the National Enquirer as a means of blackmail.
S. E. Cupp was the first to cast doubt on the claims made by Joe Scarborough. In a segment on CNN she laid out several reasons why she thought the claims were false and unfounded.
“You’d imagine a seasoned broadcaster and former political official would record [phone calls with Trump],” Cupp opined. “If he didn’t, that’s a little odd to me.”
Stelter, a notorious anti trump figure then agreed with his fellow guest, saying that he “had the same questions for NBC.”",1
"The president of the American Heart AssociationJohn Warner suffered what doctors say was a minor heart attack last week.
What makes the news ironic is that his organization recently advised people to stop using butter in their foods and replace it instead with toxic, artery-clogging vegetable oils.
An official advisory by the AHA, which was issued to cardiologists around the world, said consuming the polyunsaturated fat in ‘healthy‘ spreads and oils could cut the risk of cardiovascular disease by 30 per cent, the same benefit, they said, as seen from taking cholesterol drugs.
Natural News reports: According to a published report on the AHA website, Warner — himself a cardiologist (another irony) and CEO of UT Southwestern University Hospitals in Dallas — is in stable condition after doctors inserted a stent into a blocked artery.
“John wanted to reinforce that this incident underscores the important message that heleft us with in his presidential address yesterday– that much progress has been made, but much remains to be done. Cardiac events can still happen anytime and anywhere,” saidNancy Brown, chief executive officerof the AHA.
In that talk, Warner told a Scientific Sessions meeting — where he gave his presidential address — that there were “no old men” in his family, and that is due largely to heart disease.
“I know this is also true in far too many other families, not just in the U. S., but around the world. I believe the people in this room have the power – and even the duty – to change that. Together, we can make sure old men and old women are regulars at family reunions,” he said.
“In other words, I look forward to a future where people have the exact opposite experience of my family, that children grow up surrounded by so many healthy, beloved, elderly relatives that they couldn’t imagine life any other way.”
Fair enough, and an admirable goal to be sure — but then why would his organization make the recommendation to change from butter, which is natural, a healthy fat, and can even be organic, to a substance far less healthy with known ties to cardiac disease?
Could it be due to a major conflict of interest?
As we reported in June:
The AHA has long gone after healthy fats, and this time it even went so far as to say that coconut oil is bad for your heart. They would say that, of course, because eating these healthy foods keeps people from needing the prescription drugs made by the firms that support the group.
Vegetable oils may seem better, but in actuality, they’re not. Polyunsaturated fats like corn and canola oil can promote inflammation, which is responsible for an increase in cancer while slowing the body’s metabolism rate.
What’s more, nearly all canola oil is made from genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Plus, it is known to suppress thyroid function and your immune properties, and it requires extra processing by the body because of the toxins such oils contain.
“Yet they want us to believe that a chemical that was not put on this Earth for human consumption is really so much better for us than natural butter that came from a cow?” writes Isabelle Z. for Natural News.
Corn oil is so bad for the body that even some food makers who are not known to place a premium on healthy ingredients are starting to reject it along with other GMO-based oils such as soy and even canola.
On the other hand, olive oils — and in particular extra-virgin olive oil — is believed to be one of the healthiest of all oils, making the AHA’s advice on butter and vegetable oils confusing and contradictory.
But always remember that the AHA is heavily funded by the pharmaceutical industry, which survives on keeping people as sick and unhealthy as possible — another irony.",1
"The security guard from the Mandalay Bay hotel, who was hailed a ""hero"" by the mainstream media, Jesus Campos, mysteriously disappeared on Thursday only to reemerge today after visiting a ""quick clinic"".
According to a rep from Campos's union, he had been checked into theRonald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for ""psychologicalassistance"" after suffering from Post Traumatic Stress.
Campos was originally creditedwith foiling the Las Vegas massacre by interruptingsuspected shooter Stephen Paddock's shooting spree and saving countless lives.
Shortly before Campos ""vanished"" on Thursday Las Vegas Sherrif Lombard suddenly altered the timeline to completely change the narrative meaning the ""hero"" security guard was actually shot 6 minutes before the shooting started and no longer played a role in stopping the attack.
Campos' sudden disappearance raised a lot of suspicions after didn't turnup for several TV interviews, with no answers from his family or security as to where he had gone.
The flames of suspicion were fanned even further when it was reported that MGM Resorts International - the company that owns the Mandalay Bay hotel where Campos worked - completely scrubbed his information from their employee database without explanation.
Now, after days of being missing without a trace, Jesus Campos has reappeared from the same clinic that Kanye West was checked into when he had his ""breakdown"".
West was checked into theRonald Reagan UCLA Medical Center shortly after making several public outbursts about the Illuminati and for announcing his support for Donald Trump.
After receiving treatment at the clinic, the music star claimed to be suffering from severe memory loss.
On Thursday, Campos was due to appear at a press conference after being given an award for his bravery but he disappeared.
His union representative revealed on Saturday that Campos was taken to the clinic shortly afterward and he didn't know what his conditionwas but said: ""it's highly unusual.""
""I'm hoping everything is OK with him and I'm sure MGM or the union will let (media) know when we hear something,"" David Hickey is the president of the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America, toldFox 5 Vegas.
Daily Mail reports:According to the latest timeline provided by police detailing the events of October 1, Paddock sprayed 200 rounds into the hallway on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, wounding Campos in the leg, six minutes before he unleashed his barrage of bullets on the crowd attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival.
Campos, who was unarmed, survived the shooting and was scheduled to sit down for five TV interviews Thursday night, including one onFox News, but suddenly vanished.
ABC News reporter Stephanie Wash tweeted Thursday, quoting the president of Campos' labor union: ""We were in a room & we came out & he was gone.""
She followed up by writing that Campos' whereabouts were unknown.
The security guard was supposed to be interviewed by Fox News' Sean Hannity, but the host tweeted on Thursday: ""He canceled.""
Campos' disappearance came just hours after MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay, disputed the official timeline of the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, rejecting any suggestion that hotel staff delayed calling 911 for six minutes after Paddock opened fire.
The latest chronology raised a series of questions about whether officers were given information quickly enough to possibly have a chance to take out the gunman before he could carry out the bloodshed.
But according to resort officials, it was no more than 40 seconds between the time Campos used his walkie-talkie to call for help and Paddock opening fire on the crowd from two windows in his suite.
Earlier in the investigation, police had said that Paddock shot through his door and wounded Campos after the guard distracted him from firing on the crowd out the windows.
Campos’ union president said the latest timeline does not dispute the assertion that the guard is ‘still a hero, saving his coworker, possibly stopping additional shots,’ reported Stephanie Wash.
Campos isn't the first witness to mysteriously vanish, as earlier this week, a Mandalay Bay hotel valet worker also disappeared.

"Oh, you think you’re so smart, don’t you? In your small business, you’ve mastered social media. You’re a whiz at Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest or some other social media platform. Or all of the above.
And you don’t just use technology for marketing, you’ve already moved most of your small business applications to the cloud: bookkeeping and billing, payroll, customer relationship management, document storage and collaboration, and more.
You’re not afraid of high tech solutions when it comes to growing and running your small business. In fact, your attitude is: “Bring it on.” And you think that makes you a smarty pants, right?
Well, you are right. Embracing technology puts you ahead of the game when it comes to being a successful entrepreneur and growing a small company. I love technology, and I appreciate the immense power and capabilities tech has given small businesses.
But you know what? Sometimes the best solution is low-tech or even no-tech. Entrepreneurs, especially young startup entrepreneurs, may forget (or never knew) the greater impact a personal approach can have.
Here are seven no tech/low tech skills every small business owner should master:
1. Face-to-face meetings. Yes, you have many ways to communicate with customers — emails, texting, messaging on social media, and a whole world of videoconferencing apps. But remember this: People do business with other people. Nothing is as effective in landing and keeping a customer as getting to know people, face-to-face. When you visit customers in person, they realize you value them and they appreciate the commitment you’re making to them.
2. Entertaining. My most important, and effective, marketing activity  all year is  hosting a small dinner for some of my best clients and prospects during an important conference. Over the years, I’ve met their spouses, followed their career moves, and deepened relationships. It’s now more like friends getting together than a business meeting, but they’re very loyal to me and my company.
3. Trade shows and conferences. In my company that's whereI spend the bulk of our marketing dollars. Why? Because trade shows give small businesses a really big bang for their marketing buck. Choose the right trade show, and under one roof, you’ll meet, face-to-face, a large number of prospects, referral sources, potential partners. I use a very low-tech follow-up, too: A‘trade show tracker.’ Instead of taking home a pile of business cards with notes scrawled on them or trying to manage some digital card reader while meeting people, we take a simple notebook, staple business cards we collect onto the pages, and write notes underneath. Everything is together in one place.
4. Signs. With the exception of standing in a town market hawking your wares, signs likely represent the oldest form of marketing. One of the advantages of signs in that they’re persistent. You put them up, and they stay in place for a long time. Signs include awnings, with your business name and address painted on them, banners, window placards, vehicle signs with your company information, posters, shelf signs, even sandwich boards outside your business door.
5. Swag: Advertising specialties you give away to customers and prospects, imprinted with your name, logo, or message. People love getting free stuff. And these “tschotkes” — mugs, pens, sticky notes and so much more — stick around for a long-time, keeping your name in front of people.
6. Phone calls. They're now  so unusual that they pack a particularly strong punch. An upset customer? A new customer? An old customer you haven’t communicated with for a while?

It’s always good to see someone coming out to support our president, especially with the way people try to demonize him. This Trump fan came out to show his support in a MASSIVE way.
Kyle Courtney, a Texas native, recently bought a billboard for two reasons. He wanted to show his support for Trump, and SLAM ABC News for betraying him, and the American people. The billboard Courtney bought reads, “ABC News: I grew up with you. We are through. The Russians didn’t elect Donald Trump. I did.” (via Fox News Insider)

What a short, but POWERFUL message. The mainstream media has fallen apart over the past couple of years, but since Trump got elected, they started crumbling exponentially. Instead of covering any kind of real news, they resort to criticizing President Trump any way they possibly can. One of their “go to” options since the election is claiming that Trump and Russia worked together to steal the election.
Insanely enough, despite ALL the countless hours of coverage, there isn’t one single scrap of evidence suggesting that Trump and Russia worked together — for ANY purpose. The media will not admit that they were wrong. They just keep pushing their narrative forward.
If you flip over to any Liberal mainstream media outlet, you will not see them demonstrating any evidence proving that Trump and Russia hacked the election. Instead, you will see a bunch of speculation, but in a tone, that sounds as if they were reporting facts.
During an interview, Courtney let Fox News know why he made the decision to buy the billboard. “ABC News was the only channel I watched as a child growing up in Texas, but I think that they have lost touch with America, and forgotten the working man,” Courtney explained.
He went on to say this has been going on for years. When Bush was in office, everyone treated him like the Antichrist. Finally, Obama made it into office, and suddenly, he was going to be the savior of the free world as we knew it. We saw how well THAT turned out.
The polls show many people are feeling the same way about mainstream media, and messages spread by politicians. A Washington Post poll showed that a stunning 44% of Democrats believe their party no longer cares about their concerns — they have lost their credibility, and are out of touch. Instead of worrying about the people they’re supposed to be representing, they’re working on pushing their agenda, and lining their pockets. It’s about as repulsive as it gets.
CNN and MSNBC let their bias show at every turn. Just last week, both Liberal outlets continued their coverage on the Trump-Russia story, instead of showing the president’s speech in Iowa. If you recall, Trump called them out during the speech, and they turned their cameras off.
Is it any wonder why no one takes them seriously anymore? Liberal mainstream media is a joke.

"You probably haven’t noticed because nobody seems to be talking about it, but something is going on with the world. Volcanoes are erupting at a faster pace than ever, earthquakes are going crazy and nobody has an explanation for it.
What is going on with all these volcanoes erupting? You may not have noticed but our planet is becoming increasingly unstable. For the 20th century there was a total of 3,542 volcanic eruptions, and when you divide that number by 100, that gives you a total average of about 35 volcanic eruptions per year. So the number of volcanoes that are erupting right now is well above the 20th century’s average for an entire calendar year.
Not to mention the tremendous amount of earthquake activity that is happening as well. As I mentioned yesterday scientists are saying that the world is preparing itself for a “world changing mega tremor with the power to split up continents.”
“If it seems like earthquakes and erupting volcanoes are happening more frequently, that’s because they are. Looking at global magnitude six (M6) or greater from 1980 to 1989 there was an average of 108.5 earthquakes per year, from 2000 to 2009 the planet averaged 160.9 earthquakes per year: that is a 38.9% increase of M6+ earthquakes in recent years.
Unrest also seems to be growing among the world’s supervolcanoes. Iceland (which is home to some of the most dangerous volcanoes on the planet), Santorini in Greece, Uturuncu in Bolivia, the Yellowstone and Long Valley calderas in the U. S., Laguna del Maule in Chile, Italy’s Campi Flegrei – almost all of the world’s active super-volcanic systems are now exhibiting some signs of inflation, an early indication that pressure is building in these volcanic systems.”
But people are living in blissful ignorance, people never seem to care about the things that are affecting them directly. It is time to pay attention to the warning signs, open your eyes!

"Federal investigators have subpoenaed records related to a $3.5 million mortgage that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort took out on his Hamptons home just after leaving the campaign, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The mortgage document that explains how Manafort would pay back the loan was never filed with Suffolk County, New York — and Manafort’s company never paid up to $36,000 in taxes that would be due on the loan.
In addition, despite telling NBC News previously that all his real estate transactions are transparent and include his name and signature, Manafort’s name and signature do not appear on any of the loan documents that are publicly available. A Manafort spokesperson said the $3.5 million loan, which was taken out through a shell company, was repaid in December, but also said that paperwork showing the repayment was not filed until he was asked about the loan by NBC News.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is also taking a ""preliminary look"" at Manafort's real estate transactions, according to a separate source. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the Justice Department has requested Manafort's banking records.
Jason Maloni, a spokesperson for Manafort, said, “Mr. Manafort has not been contacted by any authorities other than the United States Congress and officials responsible for FARA guidance, and he is cooperating with those inquiries.”

On August 19, 2016, Manafort left the Trump campaign amid media reports about his previous work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, including allegations he received millions of dollars in payments.
That same day, Manafort created a holding company called Summerbreeze LLC. Several weeks later, a document called a UCC filed with the state of New York shows that Summerbreeze took out a $3.5 million loan on Manafort’s home in the tony beach enclave of Bridgehampton.
Manafort’s name does not appear on the UCC filing, but Summerbreeze LLC gives his Florida address as a contact, and lists his Bridgehampton home as collateral.
A review of New York state and Suffolk County records shows the loan was made by S C 3, a subsidiary of Spruce Capital, which was co-founded by Joshua Crane, who has partnered with Donald Trump on real estate deals. Spruce is also partially funded by Ukrainian-American real-estate magnate Alexander Rovt, who tried to donate $10,000 to Trump’s presidential campaign on Election Day but had all but the legal maximum of $2,700 returned.
The mortgage notice for the loan, however, was never entered into government records by the lender. A mortgage notice normally names the lender, and gives the interest rate, the frequency with which payments must be made, and the length of the mortgage.
Real estate experts contacted by NBC News called the omission ""highly unusual,"" though not illegal.
David Reiss, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who specializes in real estate law, said, ""It would be totally ill-advised to not record the loan on the property that is being secured. … Recording the mortgage on the property protects the lender.""
Without it, there’s no public record that the borrower owes money.
The mortgage notice would also show the mortgage tax has been paid. A party who does not file a mortgage notice but does pay tax would have to file a separate affidavit, which would be in the county’s property file. Suffolk County records do not show that the tax was paid.
Suffolk County charges a 1.05 percent tax rate on mortgages. Absent any exemptions, the amount owed would be about $36,750.
Manafort’s spokesperson, Jason Maloni, said the loan was only meant to serve as a bridge loan. A copy of another required filing, the UCC 3, made available to NBC News by Maloni shows that the loan was repaid in December. Maloni said the UCC 3 was not filed until May 2, after NBC News asked about the loan. The UCC 3 has not yet appeared in state or Suffolk County records.
Why was there no mortgage notice? Manafort’s real estate attorney, Bruce Baldinger, said that the loan was sent for recording, ""in due course,"" by the title company but was returned by the county recording clerk ""due to deficiencies in accompanying documents. Mr. Manafort had no role in this process other than assisting counsel in remedying the deficiencies.""
Suffolk County does not keep records of failed or improper mortgage filings.
Baldinger said Spruce Capital had required that Manafort create the LLC to receive the loan, and that the Hamptons property had previously been held in the name of Kathleen Manafort, Paul’s wife. Baldinger said that Manafort himself was never the borrower.
The deed for the Bridgehampton house was transferred from Kathleen Manafort to Summberbreeze LLC in December 2016.
There is also a question as to how the loan came about and how the lender and borrower were introduced. Two people involved say that independent broker Millenium Estates LLC brought the deal to Spruce.
However, Manafort’s spokesperson Maloni said Millenium wasn’t the independent broker.
Baldinger said that the relationship with Spruce Capital originated with an independent mortgage broker who was introduced to Manafort by Manafort’s son-in-law. ""The broker then introduced me to Spruce Capital,"" said Baldinger.
""Prior to the transaction, Mr. Manafort had no knowledge of either the broker, Spruce Capital, or its principals. After the repayment of the loan, Mr. Manafort had no further dealings or contact with Spruce Capital or its principals, nor had he any reason to be in any contact with them.""
A spokesperson for Spruce Capital said the loan came from an unnamed independent broker. Asked about Spruce backer Alexander Rovt and whether he had any role in the deal, the spokesperson said ""We are unaware of any connection to Alexander Rovt.""
Rovt is a Ukrainian émigré to the U. S. who earned more than $1 billion selling fertilizer in Ukraine and buying real estate in New York. In 2011, he sold all his overseas interests to Dmytro Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch who had been Manafort’s business partner in a failed $850 million hotel redevelopment deal.
Firtash is under U. S. indictment in an unrelated case and facing extradition from Vienna, Austria.
A spokesperson for Alexander Rovt said, ""As far as he knows, [Manafort’s loan] came to Spruce through an unrelated broker like any other deal.""
Manafort’s LLC, Summerbreeze, took out a new $9.5 million loan in December using the Hamptons property as part of the collateral. The lender is Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, whose chief executive Steve Calk was an economic adviser to the Trump campaign.
NBC News and other media outlets reported in March that Manafort had used LLCs to buy four properties in New York City between 2006 and 2014 for cash, and had then taken out mortgages on them.
Manafort said through a spokesman at the time that his real-estate transactions were ""executed in a transparent fashion and my identity was disclosed — in fact my name is right there on the documents in one of today's news reports.""",0
"In the massacre that happened Sunday in Las Vegas, one veteran proved that there are still good people in the world. He stole a pickup truck for the sole purpose to help the wounded victim and take them to the nearest hospital.
The owner wrote to him the next day asking for his keys back.
Taylor Winston, 29, an Iraq war veteran, transported nearly 30 wounded people to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center before the ambulance vehicles arrived at the scene.
Tuesday Winston on CBS This Morning talked about his experience.
“Me and a friend went and got a few drinks and found our other friends near the side stage and we just kind of posted up there to watch and enjoy the concert,” he recalled.
Winston and Jenn Lewis, his girlfriend, were having fun dancing at the concert just seconds before the shooting started.
“People started scattering and screaming and that’s when we knew something real was happening,” he said.
Winston, Lewis and many others learned quickly that the way of their escape was blocked by a fence.
Winston then realized a “bunch of white trucks” were in front of him.
Winston joined the Marines at age of 17 and served two tours in Iraq.
Like most veterans, Winston doesn’t think of himself as a hero even though he saved many lives.
According to some Fox News, Winston parked the truck as close to the concert venue could have without getting too close to the scene.
On Monday Winston got a message from the truck owner.",1
"Two weeks on from the devastating attacks in Las Vegas, that left 59 dead and hundreds more injured, and the world is still left waiting for answers as to why it happened, yet 5 key witnesses in the investigation have either died suddenly or mysteriously disappeared.
As the mainstream media continues to push the failing ""lone wolf"" shooter narrative onto the public, people who hold vital information about the true events that took place are being silenced.
One common thread between these 5 people is that their version of events offers fresh insight into what really happened, and some of themwere giving eyewitness statements that directly conflicted with the story being pushed by the MSM and law enforcement officials.
The latest witness to have had her statement silenced was 28-year-oldKymberley Suchomel.
Kymberley was one of the lucky ones at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino who managed to escape the hail of bullets without being injured.
Shortly after escaping the scene, she made a statement to the media claiming that there were multiple gunmen firing weapons into the crowd and that she was chased by one such man.
She said that not only was there additional gunmen firing weapons into the crowd from the ground, but they were chasing people who were escaping and gunning them down too.
When she was questioned on the veracity of her story, given the official story that there was only one gunman, she said that she was more than 100% sure that she was right.
Kymberley Suchomel's original Facebook post about her version of events has been mysteriously deleted since her passing, but anarchived version of the original post can be viewed here.
WHY IS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA NOT REPORTING THIS?
Kymberley gave a very detailed account of what she had seen in the days following the horrific event in which she questioned the official story being propagated by the mainstream media.
She said that she had been watching the news with her family constantly since she had arrived home and that she did not believe that the official version of events made sense.
In addition to claiming that there were multiple gunmen at the scene, she also claimed that towards the beginning of the evening that a woman made her way onto the stage and warned the crowd that they were going to die.
She and her boyfriend were later escorted from the premises.
She also said that she had spoken to other survivors who had also mentioned that there were multiple shooters on that fateful night, including one on the ground.
According to Kymberley’s grandmother, Julie Norton, she died in the early hours of Monday morning at her home.
She said she discovered her granddaughter’s body just after 8.30 in the morning when she arrived to take care of her great-granddaughter, Scarlett.
She believes Suchomel may have died in her sleep after her husband, Mike, left for work at 4:30 a.m.
Norton told the Daily Press: ""I believe the stress from the shooting took her life.""
Before she died, Kymberley said that while she was not injured in the devastating attack that she believed that she was going to be ""emotionally and mentally scarred for life.""
MAJOR COVER-UP: KYMBERLEY IS NOT THE ONLY KEY WITNESS TO HAVE DIED SINCE THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTING
In a sinister turn of events, it has emerged that Kymberley is not the only key witness to have died since the Las Vegas shooting.
1) John Beilman, who was wanted by federal agents following the discovery of a communications device in the hotel room of the officially identified shooter Stephen Paddock, killed both himself and his disabled daughter in an apparent murder-suicide.

2) In addition to that, a valet worker named Chad Nishimura who parked Paddock’s car has also disappeared after giving a statement to local news networks about his brush with the killer.
READ MORE: Hotel Worker Vanishes After Saying Stephen Paddock 'Didn't Have Many Bags'
Nishimura described Paddock as a ""normal guy"" and said that he had ""hardly any bags with him"".
3) It has also been revealed that a security guard named Jesus Campos who was hailed as a""hero""by law enforcement and the mainstream media on the night of the shooting, has also gone missing.
Campos suddenly reappearedagain today after being treated in the same hospitalasKanye West claimed to have his memory wiped at; theRonald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.
READ MORE: Las Vegas Shooting Security Guard Emerges From Clinic That Treated Kanye West
A spokesman for Campos' worker's union cited the reason for his visit to the ""quick clinic"" was for""psychologicalassistance""after suffering from Post Traumatic Stress.
4) Quite possibly the most important witness of them all was killed during the attack:Stephen Paddock.
Reports varied about how Paddock was killed with some initial statements saying he was killed in a police shootout, with the""official""story now saying he turned a weapon on himself.
Without the suspected shooter's own statement, we may never truly know why he was in the room with all those weapons.
Whether this series of disturbing deaths and disappearances are purely coincidental or whether there is something deeply sinister afoot has yet to be determined.
One could argue, however, that there's no such thing as coincidence.",1
"Smarmy liberal NBC News on air personality Matt Lauer claimed to be a defender of women. In class left-wing hypocrite fashion, he was proved instead to be a sex predator. When he was fired by NBC, however, his former colleague Geraldo Rivera came to his defense in a bizarre and poorly thought-out way.
Tweeted Fox News’ Rivera after word got out that Matt had been unceremoniously dumped by NBC, “Sad about@MLauergreat guy, highly skilled & empathetic w guests & a real gentleman to my family & me. News is a flirty business & it seems like current epidemic of#SexHarassmentAllegationsmay be criminalizing courtship & conflating it w predation. What about#GarrisonKeillor?”
Rivera later added,“A jerk’s a jerk in dating. [Sexual harassment] should be confined to situations where superior imposes himself on subordinate who feels unable to complain because of power of perp or feared consequences to victim’s employment. Shouldn’t be used to get even w bad bosses or hated ex’s.”
Rivera’s defense of creepy liberal Lauer did not go over well with the public. Wrote one Twitter user in response, “Not sure having a remote door lock button on your office sex dungeon counts as “flirting” or “courtship” but you’re the media professional.”
Geraldo later issued an apology, posting, “Reaction to my tweets today on#sexharassmentmakes clear
I didn’t sufficiently explain that this is a horrendous problem long hidden-Harassers are deviants who deserve what is coming to them-Often victims are too frightened to come forward in a timely fashion-I humbly apologize.” Rivera’s employers at Fox News were not amused. Network executives wrote in a statement condemning what Geraldo said, “Geraldo’s tweets do not reflect the views of Fox News or its management. We were troubled by his comments and are addressing them with him.” Do you think Geraldo should get fired for this?
Sad about @MLauer great guy, highly skilled & empathetic w guests & a real gentleman to my family & me. News is a flirty business & it seems like current epidemic of #SexHarassmentAllegations may be criminalizing courtship & conflating it w predation. What about #GarrisonKeillor?",1
"“We are going to be outlining all of our concerns over the last 60 days that appear to all be related, maybe even coordinated in some ways,” committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said to Fox News.
“I AM GOING TO BE ASKING THE FBI TO DO AN ASSESSMENT OF THIS TO TELL US WHAT’S GOING ON HERE BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE LEAKS AS A GOVERNMENT.”
According to Fox News, the intelligence community captures phone calls of Americans inside the U. S. Government of officials talking to foreign nationals. He may have talked to the Russian official, but…
Mike Flynn’s name should not have been aired. This means that there are leaks within the government that are moving to DESTROY President Trump.
This means that whoever leaked the phone calls most likely worked under Obama and is actively undermining the U. S.
“I think all foreign leaders now are going to be worried that this is going to somehow leak out. I think it has done tremendous damage to [America’s] reputation around the world, and no one’s talking about it — and this is because someone in the national security apparatus decided to leak this out. It’s very, very serious,” Bill Binney, an NSA analyst and whistleblower, said.
*** Share this 1 million times patriots!I know I say that a lot, but we have to fight back. This is a political hit on Mike Flynn.

These are going to be rough times but with God on our side, we will prevail.",1
"The media was furious after Donald Trump refused to take a question from a CNN reporter at his first press conference as president-elect Wednesday.
He blasted the network as “fake news” after it reported on an unsubstantiated 35-page document that claims Trump is being blackmailed by the Russian government.
“Don’t be rude,” Trump told Jim Acosta when he tried to ask a question. “No, I’m not going to give you a question. You are fake news.”
The press was incensed, but why did Barack Obama not generate the same outrage when he repeatedly criticized Fox News and questioned its legitimacy over the last eight years?
In 2010, he said the network promoted a “destructive viewpoint.”
“I think Fox is part of that tradition — it is part of the tradition that has a very clear, undeniable point of view,” Obama said during an interview with Rolling Stone. “It’s a point of view that I disagree with. It’s a point of view that I think is ultimately destructive for the long-term growth of a country that has a vibrant middle class and is competitive in the world. But as an economic enterprise, it’s been wildly successful. And I suspect that if you ask Mr. Murdoch what his number-one concern is, it’s that Fox is very successful.”
He criticized Fox News while talking about the Affordable Care Act in 2013.
“If you’ve talked to somebody who said, ‘Well, I don’t know, I was watching Fox News and they said this is horrible,’ you can say, ‘you know what? Don’t take my word for it! Go on the website.”
In 2014, he blasted them while giving a speech at Northwestern University.
“There’s a reason fewer are running against Obamacare,” Obama said, “because while good, affordable health care might still be a fanged threat to freedom on Fox News, it’s working pretty well in the real world.”",1
"Just how outraged should we all be about the corporate governance arrangements at Snap Inc., the Venice, California-based purveyor of spectacles and disappearing videos that went public last week? According to some people, very outraged.
“The biggest problem with the IPO,” wrote CNN Money’s Paul La Monica, “is the fact that any investor who buys the stock will have absolutely no say in how the company is run.” Snap, complained Brooke Masters of the Financial Times, “has a governance structure that is straight out of a banana republic.” Rob Cox of Reuters BreakingViews termed it “totalitarian capitalism.”
It is indeed true that the class A shares that Snap sold to the public last week come with no voting rights at all. It is also true that this is something new. As Snap put it in its IPO filing:
Although other U. S.-based companies have publicly traded classes of non-voting stock, to our knowledge, no other company has completed an initial public offering of non-voting stock on a U.S. stock exchange.
Snap also has class B shares, held by executives and early investors, that come with one vote apiece. But it is the class C shares, which come with 10 votes apiece, that control the company. And they’re all in the hands of Snap co-founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy.
What a couple of tyrants! But this is a corporation we’re talking about, not a nation. Condemnations of “banana republic” governance and “totalitarian capitalism” imply that “democratic capitalism” is the ideal. Is it, though?
For starters, even companies where every share comes with one vote represent an odd sort of democracy. It’s one share, one vote, not one person, one vote. And unlike citizens, shareholders aren’t subject to any sort of naturalization requirements -- they can buy and sell shares in an instant. Meanwhile, lots of other investors (bondholders, most obviously) don’t get votes. Not to mention other important stakeholders: In Germany, it’s customary for employees to have a formal say in corporate governance. Is that more or less democratic than giving all the votes to shareholders?
There is a theory that, as the “residual claimants” to a corporation’s cash flows -- that is, the people who get paid after everyone else does -- shareholders are uniquely suited to make decisions that maximize a corporation’s economic value. There’s also the simple argument that, as the corporation’s owners, shareholders should be able to tell its executives what to do. There are also, however, legal scholars who argue that shareholders aren’t the only residual claimants and technically aren’t the owners, either. Corporate law is hard!
Even if you believe in shareholder primacy, there remains the question of which shareholders. A lot of people seem to think that committed, long-term shareholders should get more say than those who can bail out at any moment. There are various ways to accomplish this -- among them the dual-class share structures at companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc., which give certain shareholders (usually the founders) many more votes per share than others. Snap’s share structure is simply a more extreme version of this.
Scholarly opinion on these dual-class arrangements seems to be shifting. It used to be that they were seen mostly negatively, because they make hostile takeovers harder and thus remove a source of discipline for corporate managers. Now, though, one can find journal articles arguing that dual-share arrangements encourage long-term investment by corporations, and even make outside shareholders richer.
Snap, as noted, has taken things to an extreme. It’s not just that outside investors get zero votes. It’s also that, as New York Times “Deal Professor” Steven Davidoff Solomon described in a column last month, “the only way the two founders are ever really going to lose control of Snap is if both die.” By contrast, he wrote:
Google has a sunset provision on its dual class shares, while Mr. Zuckerberg is going to give up his ability to control Facebook if he leaves the company with the issuance of Facebook nonvoting stock.
So it may be that Snap’s experiment in founder entrenchment goes too far. Investors don’t seem to have a problem with it now -- as of early this afternoon they were valuing the company at $29 billion. But investors can change their minds.
Still, I think there’s more to be gained than lost in letting companies experiment like this. In some places, they can’t: The Hong Kong and Singapore stock exchanges ban dual-class shares, and in the U. K. they’re strongly discouraged. I’m not aware of any evidence that those countries produce better corporations as a result.

"Hundreds of air passengers reacted following an ABC News investigation into theft by uniformed employees of the federal agency in charge of airport security, some saying they were victims of theft and were ignored by Transportation Security Administration officials.
Rep. John Mica (R-Florida), the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, called Friday for ""a total reform and complete overhaul"" of the TSA.
The ABC News report, which included footage of a TSA officer who appeared to have taken an iPad left behind on purpose at the Orlando airport, ""is another eye-opening example of how this bloated security agency cannot properly recruit, train and oversee a ballooning 65,000 person workforce,"" said Mica.
Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Alabama), a member of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security, said the report showed that the TSA had more than just an image problem.
""The bloated agency is so overwhelmed with managing its workforce that it has lost track of its real security mission,"" Rogers told ABC News. ""It needs to become leaner and smarter.""
WATCH more on this report tonight on ""World News With Diane Sawyer.""
Department of Homeland Security Acting Inspector General Charles Edwards said the case of the Orlando TSA officer, Andy Ramirez, has been referred to the U. S. attorney's office for criminal prosecution and that any theft involving TSA personnel is ""a key concern.""
""Our investigators have dealt with a number of theft cases while our auditors are currently examining the root causes and recommending deterrents to TSA management,"" Edwards said.
The TSA said Ramirez was fired Wednesday, one day in advance of the ABC News broadcast, in keeping with its ""zero-tolerance"" policy for theft from passengers. Ramirez was the 381st TSA officer to be fired for theft, according to the TSA, and one of eleven this year alone.
The agency disputes that theft is a widespread problem, however, saying the number of officers fired ""represents less than one-half of one percent of officers that have been employed"" by TSA.
PHOTOS of TSA officers charged in connection with theft from passengers.
Since the original report aired, ABC News has been flooded with hundreds of comments on its website and on Facebook from passengers, many of whom claimed they had personal belongings taken from their luggage.
Echoing similar stories, one woman wrote that she had a laptop stolen after TSA officers went through her checked bags at JFK airport in New York and said ""the airlines and TSA have been zero help"" in getting her things back.
Several said they opened their carry-on or checked luggage after a trip in the U. S. to discover their laptop, iPad or cameras were missing. One woman said that her 10-year-old daughter had all of her jewelry stolen.
We want to hear from you. Tell us about your experience with the TSA by joining the conversation on Facebook.
Talon Windwalker told ABC News that after his Kindle went missing, no officials seemed to care.
""They were no help and basically just shrugged their shoulders. Didn't even offer to take a complaint,"" he said via Skype.
Dallas businessman Dirk Wenzlaff said he got the cold shoulder from TSA after his iPad disappeared from his checked luggage.
Using the Find Me app, Wenzlaff tracked the homing beacon on the iPad to TSA officer Clayton Dovel, who authorities said was found with at least five other stolen iPads when he was arrested.
The director of the Consumer Travel Alliance, Charlie Leocha, said the thefts in terms of dollar amounts are often minor, but still an irritation to passengers.
""It's less the value, it's the factor of being violated in some way,"" he said. ""It's like you've got someone going through your underwear, for Christ's sake.""
The Consumer Travel Alliance works closely with TSA, he said, and he urges travelers to always file a report with TSA and their airline when something goes missing.
""They are going to study it, and check into it. But you are not necessarily going to get any reimbursement from TSA"" because it is often difficult to determine whether it was an airline or a TSA problem, Leocha said.
""In some way, passengers are kind of stuck, they really don't have any specific rights when it comes to TSA or the airlines,"" Leocha said.
For the ABC News investigation, iPads were purposefully left behind on 10 different occasions at TSA checkpoints at major airports with a history of theft by government screeners. TSA officers at nine of the ten airport checkpoints followed agency guidelines and immediately contacted the owner, whose name and phone number were displayed prominently on the iPad case.
But when one iPad wasn't returned from an Orlando airport, ABC News filed a missing property report but no other action was taken. It was only when ABC News tracked the iPad to TSA officer Ramirez's home that it was recovered two weeks later. Ramirez claimed at the time that his wife had taken the iPad but was later fired.

"”Roar” singer Katy Perry clearly has not gotten the memo about how liberal celebrities’ whining about President Donald Trump has actually backfired against liberals and benefited the president.
Not one to miss an opportunity to try to get an easy headline, liberal Hillary Clinton supporter Perry was at it once again at the irrelevant MTV Music Awards, where she immediately made things political during hergimmicky hosting, where she said,“What’s up, Los Angeles! Wow, I am so happy to be back on planet earth. You guys look so great. Because, actually, before I left, I took a little break, you know? And I went to space and, when I left, it seemed like things were screwed up.”
She continued,“You look so happy, healthy, and peaceful. Feels like since I’ve been gone, you figured out all of the problems in the world right now and the world is doing so well, right.” This elicited chuckles from the liberal audience. She went on, “Everything is fine, great, maybe not so much? It’s okay. I’m just going to move forward.”
She then held up a newspaper that said “The World is on Fire.” Commented Katy,“I do need to catch up. That’s correct. The world is on fire. Great. Wow. You guys have all really been going through it, haven’t you? How, how the fuck are you coping right now?”
Paris Jackson, the daughter of Michael Jackson, also stated during the show, “If we were to all stand up, united, as one, our impact, it would be, huge. Believe me… huge and that’s not fake news. So, let’s leave here tonight remembering that we must show these nazi white supremacist jerks in Charlottesville and all over the country that as a nation with liberty as our slogan, we have zero tolerance for their violence, their hatred, and their discrimination!”Many viewers were not having it, and let Katy and Paris know about it.

"After chaos erupted in Chicago this weekend, news reports have flooded the Internet, detailing the events that led to the cancellation of a Donald Trump rally amid security concerns, but one story is sure to be ignored by the mainstream media. A Chicago cop has chosen to tell the American people the truth about the anti-Trump mob that wewon’t hear elsewhere, and the officer has a video we all need to see.
According to the Chicago police officer, who posts toSecond City Copanonymously out of fear of repercussions, the unhinged and militant leftist mob that took to the streets of Chi-town to shut downTrump’s rally were far more aggressive and destructive than reported by the mainstream media. In the blog post, the officer reveals his/her recollection of events, which paints a terrifyingly different picture than what’s been reported by news networks.
Posted by the Chicago officer, only identified as SCC, shortly after the canceled Trump event, itbegins, “The media is downplaying the ‘protests’ as isolated. It seems they aren’t broadcasting footage of the debris being thrown across Harrison by Sanders/Hillary supporters at Trump fans.”
The officer goes on to detail how protesters ran through the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)parking structure, breaking the windows out of cars with Trump 2016 stickers on them. The cop continues, “We haven’t seen any mention of the Eisenhower takeover, nor the Incident Team call-outs from assorted Districts,” referring to the media’s lack of coverage on the department calling for emergency Incident Teams to cope with the anti-Trump riot at UIC, Breitbart reports.
The brutally honest post went on, “It’s almost like they’re ashamed that the UIC tradition of supporting leftist terrorists (Ayers and his spawn) has come home to roost,” before concluding, “Last report was at least two cops needed numerous stitches to close up wounds. A speedy recovery to the injured.”
However, a longer post was made later to address questions the officer received. In the second post, SCCdetailed the failures of the police leaders to plan for and respond to violent protesters, stating there was “pretty much zero in terms of a unified Command Post” for the event and that officers had no central command to report to or coordinate response from.
“Who wrote this plan?” SCC wrote. “We’ve seen and heard reports that UIC was woefully unprepared for this. They had their own people and Monterey Security inside. The Secret Service had a presence, but they’re restricted to dignitary protection. The ISP had a squad there. And CPD. So where were the people geared up for a riot? For NATO we had an entire strike force geared up and ready to go. We had the Mounted Unit up and running. Tens of dozens of bikes. Did no one see this coming?”
SCC went on to discuss the evacuation ofthe pavilion of Trump supporters, which led to many unnecessary confrontations between Trump fans and the mob of lawless protesters, stating it was a “bad decision” that put “a few thousand people out on the street as targets.” According to SCC, the decision was“probably [made] by the UIC people attempting to ‘protect’ the building.” The cop believes it was the “same with not securing the parking structure, leading to many confrontations and property damage in the lots,” which SCC describes as another “dumb move.”
SCC continued with a long list of questions, writing, “Who gave up the expressway? Who let them block ambulances? Why did they not assemble citywide Incident Teams as soon as they knew the rally was canceled? Tact Teams? We even heard Mass Arrest kits weren’t available and only one transport wagon on scene in case arrests were made.”
The post went on, adding, “Who ever drew up this order failed miserably. Whatever the Intelligence Section was doing wasn’t nearly enough. The On Scene Incident Commander failed to anticipate even the best case scenario and every other appointee showed how incompetent they really were by not ordering up more reinforcements and more units on stand-by.”
Monday, SCC followed up with a video, whichhad been sent to the blog site, depicting the “peaceful” protests.
Originally posted to a Facebook page from Chuck Pullen of Captured News, SCC encourages the readers on the blog to “spread it around,” adding that it shows “most of what the media won’t.” The footage proves that the protests were far worse than previously reported.
As a Chicago police officer alleges that the CPD fell down on the job during this incident, we can only wonder if it was intentional. After all, Donald Trump has been the focus of repeated attacks since announcing his run for the presidency. Now, a leftist militant mob was allowed to terrorize his supporters, as their aggression and destruction is now swept under the rug.
The more information that comes forward, the more this looks like a set up in the worst way — beginning with the protesters being bought and paid for by liberal elite George Soros’ MoveOn.org to the ill preparations to handle the situation, resulting in as much chaos and destruction as possible, followed by selective reporting by the media. But it’s all Trump’s fault, right?",1

"Last August, the Federal Reserve cameface-to-facewith an army of trolls when it launched a public Facebook page, but whoever runs their social media doesn’t appear to have learned much from the debacle. Last week, the loathed central bank attempted to advise its followers on detecting scams, and it didn’t go well.
Apparently, scammers attempt to swindle unsuspecting individuals by claiming to represent the Federal Reserve, so the bank decided to offer up some advice.
“Fed FAQ: I received a suspicious-looking e-mail that claims to be from the Federal Reserve. Is it a scam?” the Fed’s official Facebookaskedbefore linking users to an official guideline.
Unfortunately for the page’s social media manager, its followers had responses ready to go, and nearly all of them bluntly contended that the Fed, itself, is a scam.
The Federal Reserve bank wascreatedin 1913 after members of the financial industrycrafted legislationto implement a central bank in the United States. Following a few modifications from concerned lawmakers, Congress passed the bill, ultimately empowering bankers to control the economy by giving themdiscretionover the money supply. To this day, the Fed is criticized for everything fromquantitative easingto itsfiat status(there is no hard commodity backing up the value of the paper currency) and its cozytieswithpowerfulfinance hegemons like Goldman Sachs. Though it undergoes partial audits, current Fed director Janet Yellen hasresistedany full investigation.
Many Americans areskepticalof the Fed’s seemingly omnipotent power, and this pushback was thoroughly reflected in the comments responding to the Fed’s post about scams. Many got straight to the point:
Some couldn’t help but point out the Fed’s ill-fated decision to bring up scams in the first place:
Others focused on solutions, like the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which is independent of the established central banking system:
To the Fed’s credit, they have not removed the post. Even so, the bank’shistorical lack of transparencyand continued control over the nation’s money supply continues to be a point of contention for countless individuals, including lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, likeSen. Bernie Sanders,Sen. Rand Paul, and former Congressman Ron Paul.
Though President Trumpintimatedon the campaign trail that he would be open to auditing the Federal Reserve, he went on toappointmembers of the financial industry to work in his administration, and it isunclearwhether he intends topursueany further action to hold the bank accountable. Until that happens, it appears the internet’s trolls are our best hope.

"The interview with Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar on Fox News was clearly a ploy to whitewash the scandal surrounding their son’s heinous crimes against their own daughters – but it has backfired. The Christian extremist world the Duggars live in is completely void of logic when it comes to common sense issues like this one, and according to Jim Bob, the Duggars aren’t alone.
In a short portion of the interview that was greatly overshadowed by the lies the Duggars were telling, Jim Bob describes how they reached out to other parents in their community and found out that many of them had “similar situations” happen in their homes.
Apparently molestation runs rampant in the homes of the Christian Right:
By taking a religion that teaches peace and love and twisting it into judgment and hate, the neo-Christians are obviously doing wrong by their children.
They teach absolute abstinence until marriage. The Duggar girls have described being taught how to kiss by their brother and father. They preach that sexual education is immoral. If what Jim Bob is saying is true, teenage boys in ultra-Christian communities are taking it upon themselves to learn at the expense of defenseless and innocent young girls.
By not allowing teenagers to experience life naturally, the Duggars managed to create an environment that could, at the very least, foster a sexual predator. Josh Duggar learned from an early age that women are subservient. Coupled with the natural curiosity of a teenager, a dangerous mind emerged.
If you believe what the Duggar’s say, Josh came to them crying every time he touched a little girl. They also admit that the molestation went on for nearly a year, and that in that time they intervened by putting “safeguards” in place, teaching the girls about “improper touching” and seeking guidance for Josh through their church.
All of that and still it went on for nine months?
There are serious problems in Christian right communities. Liberal bloggers love to report on their particular brand of crazy, but this? This is something that the authorities really need to keep an eye on so another predator doesn’t exploit the statute of limitations after his family sweeps his “indiscretions” under the Jesus fish rug.",1
"NBC News is the latest mainstream media network to come under fire amid accusations of selective editing. This time, it involves a video from a witness during the Las Vegas shooting that raises questions about the presence of multiple shooters.
The video footage was taken by Vegas taxi cab driver Cori Langdon, and the discovery was first observed by Vincent James, aYoutuber on the channel The Red Elephants:
In his comparison and contrast of the two videos, James noted that NBC’s video was edited in an apparent attempt to give viewers a different impression from what they would have gotten had they been allowed to watch the original in context.
James said, “They edited her (Langdon) voice and hyper-cut clips to make it sound like the cab driver said, ‘people are running!’” In actuality, Langdon never said such a thing and appeared to be amazed that NO ONE WAS RUNNING.
Here is a link to the tweet NBC News published, which proves James’ point.
Footage from a Las Vegas cab outside Mandalay Bay shows the moment drivers realized a gunman on the 32nd floor was shooting into a crowd: pic.twitter.com/3MmJV9uUTh
Here is what Langdon witnessed and recorded, asMatt Agorist of TFTP reported earlier this week:
Cori Langdon, taxi driver, and resident of Las Vegas was in the taxi lane at Mandalay Bay when the shooting began…she quickly realized (shooting was occurring) and began filming (evidence of multiple shooters)
In the video, shots begin to ring out. At first, the shots are far away and then, all of the sudden, they are right on top of her. This happens several times during the first two minutes of the video…[She can even be heard]saying, “It is now coming from further away.”
Using multiple firing positions is a military tactic designed to throw off the enemy. A single firing position is relatively easy to pinpoint, so the use multiple points of fire is employed to ‘blur’ the locator’s image.
As she continues to film, the rounds continue to be heard for several minutes. As she leaves the front drive of Mandalay Bay, Langdon says, “It seems like it’s coming from up there.”
In his video, James concluded, “Nevertheless, something is very fishy and nothing adds up.” He pointed to the fact that Vegas is saturated with high definition video cameras and footage has still not been made available showing Stephen Paddock, the suspect in the deadly shooting, bringing in his dozens of guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition.
James also presented clips of Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo admitting he has been less than forthcoming in revealing what he knows. Until he does, very few of the Americans who are now awake to what is occurring will continue to have faith and trust in the LVMPD’s explanation of what occurred on Sunday.
Equally mystifying is one fact, as TFTP reported, that it took 1 hour and 15 minutes for police officers to break down the door to Paddock’s room and to make contact with the suspected gunman. After using explosive detonations to gain entry into the room, they reportedly found him deceased.
And that’s really all the American people are being told about the room, the man, the attack—which left 59 dead and over 500 injured—and the reasons behind why the suspect did what he did. Now, it seems, mainstream media networks such as NBC News are doing more to distort the facts than to educate the public.
Are they doing so willfully or intentionally to deceive the American people? These questions and more remain, including how anyone at NBC News could be so inept as to be able to selectively edit such an important piece of evidence, to the point that the video no longer carries the same meaning. NBC’s edited version truly gives a false impression of what really took place during the massacre in Las Vegas.
Langdon maintains that there were multiple shooters Sunday night, and for the moment, she still has proof.Here is her video as uploaded by another user:",1
"The Trump administration is threatening to cutgrant money for Milwaukee Countyover so-called ""sanctuary"" policies for immigrants.
The U. S. Department of Justice sent letters Fridayto officials in Milwaukee County, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia,New Orleans, Miami-Dade County, Ill., Cook County,Nevadaand California warning thatinterfering with the ability of police or sheriffs' officials to communicate with federalauthorities about immigration status of prisoners and others could cost them federal funding.
""Many of these jurisdictions are also crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime,"" the Justice Department said in an accompanying news release.
In a letter to Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, a Justice Department official demanded documentation and an official opinion from legal counsel by June 30 showing that the county is in compliance with a law barring local authorities from prohibiting or restricting information sharing about citizenship or immigration status.
At a Friday news conference, Abele and Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm said Milwaukee follows the law, and raised concerns about federal authorities spreading misleading information.
""This is neither truenor, more importantly, is it productive,"" Abele said. ""What it is is inflammatory. This is language that encourages people to conflate immigration with crime.""
RELATED:Trump tells DREAMers to 'rest easy' — but one in Mexico can't
He added that he was concerned the Justice Department was communicating ""via press release,"" andpushed back against the idea that Milwaukee is crumbling due to immigrants.
Milwaukee could lose more than $900,000 from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program. Themoney has been used to fund programs such as the community prosecution unit, and has also gone to the Milwaukee Police Department.
Abele and Chisholm both questioned what good would come from cutting grant money aimed at improving public safety.
""You can imagine the burden it would place on both the state and the local taxpayer were weto lose those,"" Chisholm said.""And the most frustrating thing about it is we have always had a great relationship with the federal government because we do exactly what we are saying we're going to do with the valued resources we're given and we always get good results for that.""
President Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to crack down on illegal immigration during his campaign, and issued an executive order about the issue during his first week in office.
And Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month warned that recipients of federal grants could lose funding if they fail to comply.
""This latest exercise in bullying is part of Trump and Jeff Sessions'campaign of terror against immigrant families, Muslims, African-Americans, Latinxsand LGBTQ people,"" the group'sexecutive director Christine Neumann-Ortiz said in a statement. ""They are more interested in overturning decades of civil rights advances thanpublic safety.""",0
"Last weekend, Hurricane Harvey devastated parts of Texas with historic rain that drove tens of thousands of people to shelters. As this unfolded, AT&T and Verizon -- two of the state’s biggest companies -- both tweeted that they were offering free data to affected customers, helping them communicate with rescuers and loved ones. It was a smart and compassionate move. But not every company took such a thoughtful approach on Twitter.
Chick-fil-A -- the most popular fast-food chain in Texas – touted its hash brown scrambles on Saturday, while Burger King tweeted on Sunday that “The secret to happiness is Chicken Fries.” Target -- the state’s most popular shopping chain -- tweeted on Saturday, “We’re pawsitively pumped for #NationalDogDay! Spoil your fur baby with our latest & greatest pet products.” (To its credit, the next day the company tweeted a message of support, and the day after that it announced donations to relief organizations.)
During a major disaster like Harvey -- from which the federal government says it will take years to recover -- the most appropriate things for companies to do are to express sympathy and, ideally, offer aid to the victims.That’s because Americans believe businesses should practice corporate social responsibility. A 2017 study by Cone Communications found that 70 percent of Americans expect companies to take action on social challenges, even when they’re not related to their core business functions. Eighty-seven percent say that a company’s values are a factor in their purchasing decisions.
So tweeting trivialities or pushing products during a national catastrophe will damagea corporation’s reputation. It makes the company appear callous and mercenary. And it’s certainly ill-advised to try to benefit from a disaster. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, for example, American Apparel was widely denounced on Twitter for its ad offering a discount to customers who were “bored by the storm.” (However,tweets promising that a portion of sales during a disaster will be donated to relief efforts can both position businesses as good corporate citizens and boost sales.)
While forecasters knew Harvey was coming, it’s possible that companies such as Chick-fil-A scheduled their fluffy tweets in advance using platforms such as HootSuite, before they fully understood the scale of the hurricane’s devastation. Staffers could have forgotten about the scheduled tweets, or just not stopped later to consider that it might seem insensitive to talk about hash brown scrambles while so many of their customers were underwater.
This is why I advise my students and clients never to pre-schedule social media posts. A message only makes sense in the context of the climate in which it’s delivered. If members of their community or industry are in the throes of a major catastrophe, that’s usually the only topic appropriate for a company to talk about on social media.
Another dreadful public-relations strategy is to release negative news during a disaster, in an effort to generate less negative media coverage. This tactic appears most popular among politicians. For example, the White House decision to make three controversial announcements just as Harvey was hurling toward Texas was widely seen as an effort to bury the news. Similarly, the day of the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a U. K. government official named Jo Moore wrote a memo to her colleagues saying that it was “a very good day to get out anything we want to bury.”
Corporations have often tried to minimize attention for announcements likely to harm their stock prices by releasing them on Friday afternoons and other times when they hope people will be distracted. A 2014 study found that earnings reports released during busy days, on Fridays, and after hours were lower than those issued at other times (compared with consensus forecasts).
But these strategies tend to backfire. Just as the efforts by Trump and Moore received widespread negative coverage, a 2004 study found more volatility in company stock prices when they delivered bad news on Fridays.
Waiting until people appear distracted to drop damaging news doesn’t work. It’s usually just seen as disingenuous. Instead, corporate communicators should focus on not letting themselves become distracted when it’s appropriate to respond to catastrophes in their communities.

"The great boogeyman of liberals everywhere, Roger Ailes, has been gathered in by his creator, and will never haunt their dreams again. The reinventor of Richard Nixon and the image-enhancer behind Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, he dragged the Republican Party into modernity. But it was as auteur of the Fox News Channel, which he launched in 1996 with media scoundrel Rupert Murdoch, that he seized the liberal amygdala and jolted it with the scariest right-wing agit-prop his underlings could fashion.
Ailes was a revolutionary in reactionary clothing. Before the advent of Fox, liberals might have to contest conservatives on the ballot, but their lock on media was unbreakable from the Kennedy era through the mid-1990s. Following the literary critic Lionel Trilling, who once dismissed conservatism as “irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas,” the liberal media would host a few conservative writers on the premises—James J. Kilpatrick, William F. Buckley Jr., William Safire, George F. Will—but largely to remind the public of what kooks they were. Then came Ailes and Murdoch, betting that the market for conservative journalism and commentary was underserved by the broadcasters and CNN. In the words of Michael Wolff, Ailes didn’t divide the country, as liberals would have you believe, he merely “chipped off his own profitable piece” of the TV news market by turning politics into “a special interest category.”
Ailes was a witty man, reporters will tell you, happy to share an offending comment without worrying about the consequence. But nobody would look at his complete record and conclude that he was a good man. He was vengeful, as Gabriel Sherman's book, The Loudest Voice in the Room, shows repeatedly. He engaged in thuggery. At Fox, he ruled by terror, trashing his reporters behind their backs. He used Fox to promote conspiracy theories. He spied on the reporters who worked on the small newspaper he owned in Putnam County, New York, and bullied his way around town. And, of course, he attempted to coerce sex from his employees. He was the villain in the novel of his life.
Whether you’re a Fox fan or a Fox hater, you can’t deny that Ailes broadened the range of opinion heard on TV and discussed at the barbershop. Practicing by-any-means-necessary methods one associates with the far left, he moved conservatism out of its media ghetto and into the mainstream. The liberal press never really understood his mission. Going back to the beginning of Fox, you can see the New York Times completely misreading what Ailes and Murdoch were trying to build. Writing before its launch, the paper’s TV reporter claimed that “given the current state of Fox News as described by some insiders, it may be less a toy than an imaginary friend.” CNN founder Ted Turner didn’t see what was coming either. He said, “I look forward to crushing Rupert Murdoch like a bug,” and later compared Murdoch to Hitler. Ailes retaliated by calling CNN the Clinton News Network and built his success on running an anti-Clinton News Network, one that placed showmanship ahead of shoe-leather reporting. The result has been one of the most profitable properties in all of cable TV: Fox News generates about $1.6 billion in revenue a year.
To the horror of news professionals, who think of journalism as holy text, Ailes infused his enterprise with the ethos of a bordello, placing raucous entertainment ahead of piety. Where most news outlets offered the dessert of commentary after a big meal of news, Ailes made his very partisan commentary the main course at Fox. And he placed the feast in prime time. Taking a cue from talk radio, Ailes took the right-wing fight over politics and culture to the tube. In doing so, he didn’t so much invent the modern approach to news, which was eventually copied by the liberals at MSNBC, as he rediscovered it. The newspapers of the mid-1800s, then the “yellow” journals of Pulitzer and Hearst, and finally Col. Robert M. McCormick’s Chicago Tribune—were more often entertaining than they were informative. Like Fox today, the newspapers of yore toed a party line (or their own line), actively promoting and demoting candidates. So when one of your liberal friends starts moaning of how Ailes’ Fox “poisoned” politics and “defiled” journalism, place an ice cube on their amygdala, dose them with fentanyl, and hand them a copy of Christopher B. Daly’s history of journalism, Covering America. After reading 100 pages, they’ll snap out of it.
Today, 10 months after Ailes was forced out over the sexual harassment charges, his Fox formula continues, zombie-like, and could probably toddle on another 20 years. The Fox formula’s essence can’t be gleaned by merely watching. One must conduct field research of the Fox audience, visiting the subjects in the habitat where they consume the channel. There they will find a mostly male, mostly older audience huddled around a TV set, their hands grown arthritic from resentment, holding their palms out to their sets like it was a lit hearth. Fox viewers, unlike most of their CNN and MSNBC cousins, talk back to the channel—mostly in the confirmative. They love Fox because Ailes turned the news into a soap opera for their weary, aging eyes. For the longest stretch, it was the only mass media that understood them and their anxieties, the only channel to create TV companions like Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity that spoke for them.
And, for the benefit of the horny old codgers, Ailes made Fox the first news channel to raise hemlines, mandate the blondifcation of the female broadcasters, and to polish their lips with gloss until they shined. “Television is a visual medium,” Ailes told his authorized biographer Zev Chafets. “There’s nothing wrong with having good-looking people on the screen.”
Was the Fox show real or imaginary? No assessment of Ailes should neglect his show-business savvy and his advanced sense of stagecraft. In addition to his TV credits (The Mike Douglas Show), Ailes produced the Broadway musical Mother Earth and the Off-Broadway play The Hot L Baltimore in the early 1970s. In 1976, he produced and directed an hourlong TV special on Federico Fellini, of all people! He brought his creative and kitschy eye to cable news, staging drama in the guise of news and adding SportsCenter-like graphics to snazz up a medium that had come to resemble radio with pictures. Damn the Ailes effect all you want, but you must also damn the rest of the TV news, which has always imitated him.
When not frightening themselves over the poison Ailes was allegedly pouring into the news stream, liberals have harped on his “dangerous” decades-long ambition to elect a president. That Ailes aspired to play kingmaker was clear—but I find his efforts no more shocking than Washington Post Publisher Philip Graham’s success in attaching Lyndon Johnson to the Kennedy ticket in 1960 or his role in sketching the framework for LBJ’s Great Society.
No matter how hard he tried, Ailes always proved to be a better TV programmer than a Machiavelli. Again and again, he stocked Fox with Republican aspirants like Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, John Kasich and Ben Carson—paying them to pretend to be broadcasters while building their political profiles, only to see an unFoxy candidate steal the nomination. In 2012, the Republican winner was the anti-Fox Mitt Romney. In 2016, it was Donald Trump, who became Fox’s man only after his nomination became inevitable.
Despite the liberal caterwauling, Ailes never succeeded in remaking the Republican Party in his image. A much better case can be made that Fox made itself in the party’s existing image. The GOP nominated its first Fox-like candidate in 1964—more than three decades before Fox first flickered—placing Barry Goldwater on the top of the ticket. The party did the same again in 1968, picking Nixon, and once more with Reagan in 1980. Ailes’ primary political talent over the past two decades was to place Fox at the front of the gathering parade and call himself its leader.
If Ailes’ failure to nominate a Fox candidate does not convince you of the network’s paper tiger status, then I offer you the 2008 election when the network—at the height of its powers—could not prevent political greenhorn Barack Obama from being elected president. That humbling was reprised in 2012, when Fox failed to block Obama again. As Ailes takes his permanent nap, maybe liberals can finally get a good night’s sleep.

U. S. prosecutors have charged Suleyman Aslan, onetime chief of the Turkish state-owned Halkbank, along with some of his deputies, in an expanded investigation into a Turkish Iranian trader. (Diego Cupolo/Sipa USA/AP)      Federal prosecutors in New York have charged a former minister and other high-profile Turkish figures with conspiracy to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran, broadening an investigation into a Turkish Iranian trader to include allies of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  The case had already raised tensions between U.S. and Turkish officials, who have suggested that the probe is politically motivated. The investigation had focused mainly on Turkish Iranian millionaire Reza Zarrab, whose network of companies prosecutors allege was used to launder money for Iran. But the indictment Wednesday named additional defendants, including former economy minister Mehmet Zafer Caglayan. It also charged Suleyman Aslan, onetime chief of the state-owned Halkbank, along with some of his deputies. Caglayan is believed to be in Turkey, as is Aslan. Zarrab, 33, was arrested last year while on vacation in the United States and remains in U.S. custody. He has hired former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as his lawyer.  “Whoever brought those charges are responsible for proving them,” Turkish Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci told reporters in Ankara on Thursday. “Caglayan did not do anything against Turkey’s interests,” he said, according to the Reuters news agency. “It is no concern to Turkey if Caglayan acted against the interests of other countries.” The indictment from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York charged that Caglayan, in his capacity as economy minister, accepted tens of millions of dollars’ worth of bribes from the proceeds of the scheme. He also “directed other members of the scheme” to engage in transactions that would evade or deceive U.S. regulators, the indictment says. In more than 50 pages, prosecutors laid out what they say was a “multiyear scheme” to violate sanctions that involved senior government officials in Turkey and Iran. The alleged crimes occurred at the height of U.S. sanctions in 2012 and 2013, ahead of the relaxation of restrictions that accompanied the implementation of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Before the deal, Iran was shut out of the U.S. financial system, and the U.S. government sought to punish other banks and businesses trading with Iran. “If a foreign bank processed transactions relating to Iran, the U.S. would impose secondary sanctions — usually against the banks but also other companies — that would cut them off from the U.S. financial system,” said Timothy O’Toole, a sanctions specialist at Miller & Chevalier, a D.C.-based law firm. Prosecutors said Zarrab and his co-conspirators sought to facilitate Iranian access, through money laundering, to proceeds from its oil and gas sales to Turkey. The conspiracy allegedly included a gold export scheme and transactions falsely described as payment for food and medicine for Iran. Zarrab, who was born in Iran, has businesses in Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and China. In the indictment, the prosecutors quoted a letter he is alleged to have written to then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in which he said the Zarrab family was ready to collaborate to help Iran break free from “the grip of sanctions.”   Iran calls new U.S. sanctions a violation of nuclear deal     Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world   Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",0

A conference sponsored by one of the worlds leading financial groups may seem like an unusual forum for the President and CEO of the only noncommercial, not-for-profit television service in the United States. But we share more in common than you might think around the theme of this year's conference, Change and Challenge.
Representing public service media as I do here this morning, I believe we can and should explain, explore, and add global perspective to the changes happening at cyberspeed all around us as well as defining the challenges these changes represent for all.
You, representing the global business community, as well as military and political leadership, are responding to change and challenge by being here to participate in the Thought Leaders Programme, and contribute to an exchange of ideas and new strategic thinking.
Many of the participants here and, in particular, the WinConference sponsors, the Winterthur Group and Credit Suisse, are already engaged in innovative solutions to global change and challenge.
If together· global media and international business· forge a new commitment to build social capital, along with financial capital, we will most certainly contribute to safer, healthier, more secure and sustainable communities, countries, and world.
How to do our part in a shifting and ever-changing and more competitive media landscape is the challenge I wish to discuss with you this morning.
It's somewhat intimidating, however, to do so from the same podium where such great leaders and thinkers as Mikhail Gorbachev and Kofi Annan have spoken and where Senator George Mitchell, one of the most respected political leaders in the United States, spoke earlier this morning.
In fact, I am reminded of the story about the man who survived the famous Johnstown flood that devastated the small Pennsylvania town. All his life, he would tell everybody he met about his experiences with the flood. When he died, he went to heaven, and asked St. Peter to round up an audience so he could talk about the flood. St. Peter said, ""Glad be happy to."" But you have to remember one thing. Noah will be in the audience.
So to all the Noah's in the room, I begin by recognizing that you come to this conference with significant experience and serious thinking about the issues of our time.
I come to this conference thinking a lot about a world that is now quite literally connected by an electronic nervous system that can instantly send and receive print, audio and video. Will this make our world a more humane, more harmonious place to live or will this contribute to a greater gap between those who have what they need for connectivity and sustainability and those who do not?
Answering that question, along with the others that arise in a digitally wired world, is one of the most significant challenges for those of us in positions of media leadership in every country.
A brief historical review of previous communications revolutions offers some perspective. Most of us are old enough to remember when radio created the first electronic family circle with its reports of a world beyond our own borders; in my case, a very small town in the state of Georgia.
Then came television with both sound and image and the experience was instantly and totally transforming for everyone who sat in front of its mesmerizing light. It didn't take long for a debate about the nature of that transformation and influence to begin and it continues even now.
What happened in between the Golden Age of television, as we now fondly and perhaps with more nostalgia than actual memory refer to those early days and the multi-channel universe often described as a vast wasteland, can be answered, in part, by the evolution of mass communications into the most powerful mass advertising medium ever invented.
When it became possible to measure the number of eyeballs aggregated for the sale of products· ratings· the bottom line measurement for a successful program was established for good or not so good, depending on where one was in the chain of impact. As companies moved to more short-term earnings reports to stockholders and the financial markets, more short-term thinking began to drive decisions in all aspects of the media business, from content to distribution.
What also happened was that many of the early media barons, who were also visionaries attracted to the possibilities of a world connected by common knowledge, common concerns, common pleasures of art and culture, were replaced in the rash of consolidations and mergers with executives focused more on optimizing profits than maximizing positive impact on society.
I was fortunate enough to work for a man who is known throughout the world as a media visionary, Ted Turner. Ted believed in the power of television to change the world and with the establishment of the first 24-hour global news network, CNN, he did just that. While Ted no longer leads the company he created with vision and passion, he remains a force for good in the world through his personal philanthropy. But sadly, there is only one Ted Turner. Had there been more executives in the commercial media business as courageous and committed to positive impact as Ted, I might have continued my career there.
I had been drawn to television, as a former teacher would be, by the opportunities to communicate to an even larger classroom, and had focused my work in news and documentaries designed to inform and, dare I say, educate. I have experienced the power and influence potential of television at its best. But far too often during those 25 years with the commercial networks and cable companies, I witnessed a powerful tool for positive impact shifting focus to profits above social responsibility.
Of course, the media business is a business, granted commercial licenses for use of the broadcast spectrum. But in the late sixties, the U.S. Congress, urged by a few media visionaries, took steps to ensure that at least one part of the spectrum would be set aside for public radio and public television. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting law which set up the system to grow Educational TV, as it was known then, into a nationwide public service media enterprise. President Johnson said, ""There are plenty of miracles of communications, but now it's time to manage those miracles for public good."" He went on to challenge public radio and public television to use their communication powers to inform, to educate as well as entertain and to provide a diverse and uplifting voice for all citizens.
And it's that mission, that birthright if you will, that is the foundation of support for the 347 PBS member stations and the more than 500 public radio licensees. Even in the face of more and more competition for hearts and mind and time, we will sustain our support in the States and strengthen our partnerships worldwide with other broadcasters if we stay committed to our mission, rooted in the values of our birthright and resist the temptations to become commercialized or compromised. If we continue to provide distinct and differentiated content intended to serve, not sell, and to use media to educate and enlighten and engage, I believe the value of public service media in the United States and around the world will be seen as an essential component in every free and open society.
One hundred million people in the U.S. watch public television at some time during every month, and we attract more than 12 million unique visitors every week to the PBS.org web site. When all the public television and public radio stations are connected together, broadcasting together, it represents the largest broadcast network in the world. What reach. What an opportunity to be an agent for change. What responsibility to rise to the challenges in front of us.
One of the most formidable challenges for PBS is finding the resources we need to stay strong and vital. Only about 17% of the annual one billion dollar budget for PBS and its member stations comes from the federal government. Yearly appropriations must be solicited from Congress and state governments whose contributions vary greatly, and for most public television stations, the challenge is raising nearly 80% of their operating costs every year. Surprising to some, the largest amount of it comes from individuals who value the content and services and the rest comes from businesses and foundations.
There are exceptional examples of corporate support in the 30-year partnership of ExxonMobil Masterpiece Theatre and General Motors support for Ken Burnss series like Jazz (which is being broadcast now by many public broadcasters around the world), but we need a stronger alliance with global businesses in order to produce and distribute content that has worldwide impact and lasting value.
You can imagine how much we envy the fully state supported public broadcasters like the BBC and NHK; especially now that we, along with other broadcasters around the world, are going through a mandated conversion from an analog delivery of signal to digital transmission. For PBS, the price tag on this conversion is 1.8 billion dollars and the deadline for completion of the conversion is less than two years away.
Unlike our commercial colleagues who are playing a waiting game, waiting for more customers to be able to receive a digital signal and waiting for some technical format issues to be resolved, public television stations have been moving forward, embracing the new technology as new means to deliver on our mission, and being an innovative leader as we have often been with other technological advances. We see the new channels that digital transmission will create as new platforms for delivering distinctive, high definition and interactive content, which we are already doing on a limited basis, as well as educational services that will in turn generate new social capital in the communities we serve.
Digital technology, besides creating a new connection system for the entire planet, also offers the potential to turn every computer and every television that can log on into a new programming source, a library, a theatre, a classroom, or whatever we want to make it and it means that watching television will be truly interactive, with the capacity to receive and use data simultaneously.
There are other technological changes that are creating challenges for all broadcasters: these devices called TIVO and REPLY which can turn a 500-channel universe into a one-channel universe. They allow viewers to make their own schedules by searching all available content and selecting what you want to see and weeding out what you dont want to see. When you choose to watch the programs you have chosen to record, the device also allows you to zap right past the commercials.
Its clear what the threat is here for everyone, media and business, and theres a scramble to find a new model for advertising. I am confident one will be found and for public broadcasters, the challenge is to find a way to solicit the funding now gained through what we call pledge drives. I can tell from the smiles in the audience that some of you have seen these drives and perhaps, even some of you have responded to the call of support from viewers like you.
There's still another challenge impacting the way global media delivers news and information as well as entertainment. The rash of consolidations, mergers, and acquisitions of the past few years have virtually transformed a diverse set of media owners in each country into a few mega companies with global reach.
The recent AOL/Time Warner merger results in what advertisers call a virtuous circle of consumers captured at every content intersection with an opportunity for a transaction; that means that AOL/Time Warner's brands touch consumers more than 2.5 billion times each month.
Nothing wrong with that and, in fact, it's good news for stockholders.
But will it be good news for citizens as well as consumers?
There is also the growing concern that with fewer owners of media companies, in particular news and information driven enterprises, that the editorial voice becomes compromised as well as consolidated. Recent studies of front page news and top-line stories on television broadcasts, as well as interviews with prominent print and TV journalists, reveal a disturbing trend to avoid the stories that might negatively impact on the owners of their papers or magazines or television networks. It's hard not to run into the possibility of impact when the company owns papers, magazines, television, web services, as well as distribution systems.
There are many challenges around this issue of distribution and more to come during the transition period from analog to digital. But one thing is clear: more channels, wider distribution of content, more means of delivery will only mean more positive impact if we stay vigilant about keeping the access to all citizens open to those who serve as well as those who sell.
Such consolidation of media empires makes for powerful distribution gatekeepers. PBS and its stations are engaged in seeking governmental and regulatory support for a must carry agreement that guarantees carriage of public television signals via cable and/or direct satellite delivery, but rather than waiting for the strong arm of legislation, we are also actively negotiating for voluntary carriage on the basis that public service media is just that: a unique public service that the public deserves and values.
Another challenge to anyone committed to using media to enrich the lives of individuals and build social capital is the race to reach the largest possible audience by aiming at the lowest common denominator. With the greatest technology any generation has ever seen, we are increasingly using it to create the most degrading and disengaging programming the world has ever seen. The new reality shows, like Survivor, Temptation Island, and The Weakest Link, are making media the weakest link in the chain of responsible behavior.
Not only do I think we can do better  we have the responsibility to do better. In this interconnected world, nobody is better poised than global media companies to help us see the world in all its complexities. Nobody is better positioned to help us understand each other, appreciate our differences, and put them aside for the sake of our common survival than the global media.
Here are a few stories we need to be telling and telling in such a way that the world community sees and understands and, hopefully, becomes engaged in designing solutions.
As we begin a new century, half the world's people struggle to survive on less than $2 a day, and nearly one billion live in chronic hunger.
Almost a billion of the world's adults cannot read and in the age of endemic cell phones, pagers, palm pilots, half the people on the planet have never made a phone call.
Half the children in the poorest countries are not in school. Millions of women are victims of violence and suppressions of individual freedoms every day. Over the next half century, the population of the world is expected to grow from six billion to nine billion with the greatest increase coming in those countries that can least afford it.
The irony is, with 24-hour news cycles and international news networks like CNN, we know these issues. Even if we try, we cannot avoid all the images in print, on radio or television of the struggles of those who dont have enough to eat or medicine to heal or a future to anticipate.
We no longer have the excuse of ignorance. We can choose not to act; but we can no longer choose not to know.
So what is happening between the knowing and the responding?
Not enough and here, again, I believe we, the world's storytellers, must shoulder our share of the blame. We have not done enough.
With new technologies, we are better able to connect the world, educate the world's citizens and engage them in positive responses than ever before and, tragically, we seem to be have less will for doing so than ever before. The reach is almost universal but the impact is far from what we might desire.
Consider this recent story in TheNew York Times about the introduction of television and the internet for the first time into the isolated Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan.
In 2000, the King of Bhutan had finally agreed to allow television and the internet into his small, totally peaceful, pristine country. In welcoming the arrival of modern communications technology to his remote kingdom he urged his citizens to use good sense and judgment, saying that a television and the internet can be both beneficial and harmful to the individual and to society. Now one year later, the king and many others in the country worry that the impact has been far from beneficial.
Bhutanese children are imitating World Federation Wrestlers, teenagers are dressing like MTv and begging for brand name cosmetics and everything from language to music is changing dramatically. The king had hoped that with television and the internet, his citizens would gain a greater understanding of the outside world but, so far, the news of earthquakes or political elections is having far less impact than the advertising that accompanies the programming on nearly every channel beamed into the country.
Bhutan is experiencing a new wave of antisocial behavior and its first generational gap. There's been a profound shift in values that threatens, with little more than a year of exposure to television, the fabric of a society. As one elder put it, stories are our way of transmitting social values and as sitcoms and action films replace our stories, our society becomes more fragile.
I submit that in far too many other countries media is contributing to an ever-increasing fragility of values because we are no longer telling the stories that keep a society strong and connected and sustainable. We have replaced those stories with reality programs like Fear Factor and Big Brother, and replaced news that puts events in perspective and issues in context with quick sound bites and eye candy, intended to tune us OUT not tune us IN.
For example, recent research by the Annenberg Policy Center indicates that last year in America, there were 24,528 stories written about the TV show, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire  but just 8,335 stories on the millions of dollars being saved through global debt relief. There were 12,476 stories written about the TV show Survivor, but less than a quarter of that amount about the millions of people who aren't surviving the spread of HIV and AIDS.
As we go forward, we in the media will constantly face a choice between profits and public service; between focusing on what is entertaining or what is newsworthy; between what matters and what amuses. But if we are going to achieve our full potential as a global village in the 21st Century, there needs to be more of a balance than there is today.
Here are a few new reality shows I'd like to see.
How about a series of programs on the recent debt relief deal signed by 23 of the greatest debt ridden countries? I can assure you that if I suggested such a topic, there would be a stare of disbelief and a reminder that nothing is harder to make compelling than economics on television. But let's just imagine that we followed the money from the developing countries that had been servicing the debt to the poor countries that struck a new bargain.
What did they do with the money? In Uganda, twice as many kids are now going to school. In Mozambique, debt payments are down by 42 percent, allowing health spending to increase by $14 million this year. In Cameroon, a 28 percent reduction in debt payments is freeing up $114 million, much of which is going to fight AIDS.
Compelling stories, dont you agree? Positive problem solving that could be replicated elsewhere.
What about more stories on AIDS?
Today, 36 million people are infected with the AIDS virus worldwide. Of that, 24 million live in Africa. AIDS is already the leading cause of death, killing ten times more people than all the armed conflicts on the African continent last year. Already in South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, half of all the 15-year-olds are expected to die of AIDS. Over the next ten years in Africa, AIDS is predicted to cut the GDP in some countries by as much as 20%.
This is not simply an African problem. The fastest-growing rate of AIDS in the world is not in Africa, but in the Caribbean and in Russia. Number three is in India. And in China, while the incidence is still low, only four percent of the adult population in China knows how AIDS is spread. If we don't do anything, by 2005, instead of 36 million AIDS cases, there will be 100 million. And in a world where a person can step on a plane in Russia and land in New York, this disease knows no natural borders.
Last week in New York, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, repeated his call for a trust fund funded by the developed nations  to close the gap between what is spent and what is needed for treatment of AIDS; to help pay for life-saving medicines that prevent the spread of viruses between mother and children. And let me be the first to commend the Credit Suisse group for pledging more than $1 million to help meet this effort.
Media should follow this story every day for progress reports and give plenty of print and TV time to those who are stepping up with financial and social capital to help bring an end to the divide between the infected and the fearful, those who can afford treatment and know about prevention and those still in the dark and still suffering.
There is another story that should be capturing the global media spotlight on a regular basis: the threats to sustainable life on Planet Earth.
Global warming is a reality and there are no borders to the impact of climate change. It may be more incremental in its impact in some places, but the fact is that unless all nations do their part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, little else is going to matter at the turn of the next century.
The six warmest years since the 15th Century have all been in the 1990s. Unless we change course, scientists predict that seas will rise so high they will swallow islands and coastal areas. Storms and droughts will intensify. Those hit hardest will be the poorest among us. And diseases like malaria will be borne by mosquitoes to higher and higher altitudes and across borders threatening more lives.
Today the United States is the world's biggest contributor to greenhouse gases, and I am hoping that we will assume our rightful place as a leader in finding solutions to what has to be seen as the biggest potential disaster facing all of us.
There is a $1 trillion market today in the world, mostly untapped, for available new technologies that promote alternative energy and energy conservation; we have just scratched the surface of telling the world's citizens about these technologies and the difference they will make.
At PBS, we do tell these stories and they make a difference. Recently, Bill Moyers, a respected and renowned journalist in the States whose work is exactly what differentiates public service media, produced the first global report card on environmental degradation and what is being done to reverse the damage in five ecological zones. Our FRONTLINE documentary series and the independent film series called P.O.V. also tackle the tough issues regularly and, regularly, the impact is measurable. And we measure impact, not ratings, for all the documentaries, specials, historical and science series, the daily NewsHour and the analysis programs on PBS.
You should expect and demand the same of the media in your countries and when possible, support the efforts of public service media to produce and distribute content that builds trust, connects people to each other and offers them opportunities to be proactively engaged in addressing the changes and challenges in all communities, all countries. That will close the gap between knowing and responding. That will help stem the decline of social capital and begin to build its reserve.
As crucial as our laws and institutions are, democracy and freedom are only truly sustained when citizens are engaged and involved, showing through their actions that they believe everyone is entitled to a fair chance at the pursuit of health and happiness and a secure, sustainable community in which to live. That is the essence of building social capital. That is the essence of a world we want to live in and leave to our children.
More than five centuries ago, this concept of social capital was alive in Europe but it didn't become widespread and truly functional until the printing press helped to spread a large body of shared civic knowledge to an informed and engaged public. In a world that is increasingly connected by one touch of a computer key the only limit to the number of people we can reach with information that empowers, engages and positively impacts are the limits of own imaginations and aspirations.
No generation has ever had the chance we do to build a global economy that leaves no one behind and, in the process, to create a new century of peace and prosperity. It's been said that the media writes the first draft of history. Today, more than ever before, we, you and I, media and business together, have a chance to write the first draft of the future that will be better for our generation and all those to come.
I hope we make the most of it. Thank you.",0
"Some Apple junkies aren’t taking a new commercial by Samsung very well at all. The advertisement makes fun of not only the iPhone but those who are loyal Apple customers too.
Samsung and Apple have always been at odds, and the Korean giant has historicallypulled no punches when it comes to mockingits adversary. Now though, the company has gone “no holds barred” as they poke fun at those who spent their money on the iPhone X.
The infamous ad shows a protagonist who is an avid Apple fan. We see images of Apple’s famous long queues outside its stores, an old-fashioned unboxing, and even a long wait in the rain. As the years go by, the iPhone-loving man is inadvertently taunted by his girlfriend, who is seen using a variety of Galaxy smartphones in just the right situations where it would have been more useful than an Apple smartphone. While he’s typing a phone number, for instance, she whips out her S Pen to comfortably handwrite it. They then both fall in a pond — her Galaxy S7 is safe, while his iPhone 6S can only pray that a bowl of rice will do the trick. –Business Insider
The commercial is actually quite good, for all intents and purposes. It basically shows all the stereotypes of a typical iPhone user, and not in an offensive way. At the end of the commercial, called “Growing Up,” the protagonist, seemingly fed up with Apple’s problems, gifts himself a brand-new Galaxy Note 8.The gist of it is a common argument laid out by Android users: that Apple adopts every feature long after Samsung. Whether that is waterproofing, camera quality, wireless charging, a larger screen, etc.
It’s been some time since Samsung mocked Applewith this ferocity over the inferiority of the iPhone becausethe exploding Note 7 set that argument back a fair amount.But the gloves are off once again with this new video released right afterlast week’s iPhone X launch.
If you know someone who has stood in those crazy long lines just to spend hundreds of dollars to get the newest iPhone, you may get a little smile out of this commercial. Heck, if you’ve stood in one of those lines, who knows, maybe you can relate. Of course, whether or not you bought the new iPhone may dictate what degree of humor you see in the ad.

These few days we’ve started seeing the news about Debbie Wasserman-Schultz’s IT aide being not only the subject of a federal investigation, having sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to a Middle East nation and then being arrested fleeing the country.
However, the IT Imran Awan had access to all emails and files not only of Wasserman Schultz but dozens of members of Congress. He also had the password to the iPad Wasserman Schultz used for Democratic National Committee business before she resigned her chairmanship in shame in 2016 for ethics violations surrounding rigging the primary election for Hillary Clinton.
But the situation with the Awan brothers is worse than we all think. Now Wikileak’s Julian Assange has connected Imran Awan to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi via a series of tweets that indicate Awan most definitely had access to her IT hardware as well.
“Pelosi is doing s [sic] closed door meeting. No staff or anyone allowed. Kaitlyn come to Rayburn room and get her iPad for Imran.
Thanks.
Tracie and Kate I will call Kate. Conf in Tracie
However, despite there are proofs that Awan had access to her iPad, on a press conference Nancy Pelosi said she isn’t ‘familiar’ with the Awan brothers investigation.
This is her standard answer for NOT answering questions she’s afraid will disclose her part in the crime. We know she’s guilty and she knows she’s guilty. That’s why she and the rest of her cronies are fighting against our President Trump so hard.
The entire criminal organization known as the Democrat Party is about to come crashing down. They got destroy by them self because of all the illegal thing they thought they were untouchable.
Now, as more and more comes to light on this IT scam and the Democrats, the level of the swamp is beginning to lower. That is why they don’t like Trump. Their little money schemes are going to go down the drain.
What do you think? Spread this story worldwide because the mainstream media won’t report this!!!",1
"CNN’s Fareed Zakaria appeared on Don Lemon’s show to talk about Trump’s wiretapping claim and he totally had a huge meltdown.
This is called Trump Derangement Syndrome, folks. These media people are literally losing their collective minds at everything Trump does. It’s sad!
FAREED ZAKARIA: “I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS SOMEWHAT INDIFFERENT TO THINGS THAT ARE TRUE OR FALSE. HE HAS SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE BULL SH*TTING. HE HAS SUCCEEDED BY BULL SH*TTING. HE HAS GOTTEN INTO THE PRESIDENCY BY BULL SH*TTING. IT’S VERY HARD TO TELL SOMEONE AT THAT POINT THAT BULL SH*T DOESN’T WORK BECAUSE LOOK AT THE RESULTS RIGHT?”
Don Lemon didn’t even know what to say to the piece. This wasn’t a slip-up. Zakaria keeps on going on and on. It’s so funny to watch fake news CNN call out Trump as a liar.

"Responding toRussian-funded political advertisements,Facebook chairmanMark Zuckerberg declaredlast month that “we will do our part to defend against nation states attempting to spread misinformation.”But Facebook is effectively sowing disinformation by kowtowing to foreign regimes and censoringatrocities such asethnic cleansing in Myanmar.In the name of repressing fake newsand hate speech, Facebook is probably suppressing far more information than Americans realize.
Facebook blocked a post of mine last month for the first time since I joined it nine years ago. I was seeking to repost a blog article I had written on Janet Reno, the controversial former attorney general who died last year.I initially thought that Facebook was having technical glitches(no novelty).But I checked the page and saw the official verdict: “Could not scrape URL because it has been blocked.”
More: Trump owes Orwell for '1984.' Big Brother is his role model.
More: Fake news is a test for citizens. Here's how to pass it.
“Pshaw!” I said, or some other one-syllable epithet. I copied the full text of the article into a new blog post.Instead of using“Janet Reno, Tyrant or Saint?” as the core headline, I titled it: “Janet Reno, American Saint.”Instead of a 1993 photo of the burning Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, I substituted an irreproachable official portrait of Reno.Bingo —Facebook instantly accepted that crosspost.I then added a preface detailing the previous blockage and explaining why I sainted Reno.The ironic headlineattracted far more attentionand spurred a torrent of reposts bythink tanksandother websites.
I contacted Facebook’s press office to learn why the initial post was blocked. Facebook spokeswoman Ruchika Budhraja checked into the matter and notified me that I would be permitted to post that link. ""But why was it blocked?""I replied. She responded: “There was an image in the post that incorrectly triggered our automation tools. That issue has been corrected.”
So when did showing the home of more than 70people engulfed in flamesafter a FBI assault become beyond the pale?Facebook presumably blocked everyone who sought to share thatimage from the most vivid law enforcement debacle of the 1990s.
This was not the first time Facebook erased an iconic image that the U. S. government would be happy to see vanish. Facebook likely deleted thousands of postings of the 1972 photo of a young Vietnamese girl running nakedafter a plane dropped napalm on her village. After coming under severe criticism last year, Facebook announced that it would no longer suppress that image. Unfortunately, Facebook is unlikely to disclose a list of the images it bans. Becausemost Americans are clueless about current events and recent history, they will have little idea of what vanishes into the Memory Hole.
Zuckerberg also promised last month to continue working “to ensure our communityis a platform for all ideas and force for good in democracy.”But the Facebook vision of democracy does not include freedom of information.Facebook instructs its employees that“we will not censor content unless a nation has demonstrated the political will to enforce its censorship laws.” But in such cases, Facebook happily teams up with heavy-handed politicians to crush dissent and suppress heretical notions.
InTurkey, India,PakistanandMorocco, Facebook routinely suppresses comments from regime opponents.Facebookcooperates closely with the Israeli governmentand “Palestinian groupsare blocked so often that they have their own hashtag, #FbCensorsPalestine.”
More: Donald Trump didn't create danger of presidential dictatorship, he inherited it
In June, German police raided dozens of homes across the nation suspected of offensive social media postings and “conducted home searches and interrogations,” according to the New York Times.Facebook isdeleting 15,000 posts a month in Germanybut the government is threatening a $50-million-plus fine unless Facebook suppresses far more comments. Judith Bergman of the Gatestone Institute commented on the German mandate: ""When employees of social media companies are appointed as the state's private thought police ...free speech becomes nothing more than a fairy tale. Or is that perhaps the point?"" Other European nations are jumping on the suppression bandwagon. British Prime MinisterTheresa May last month called on Facebookto remove purportedly extremist content within two hours of a government demand.
Facebook ismassively deleting postsfrom the victims of the ongoing slaughter of ethnic minority Muslims (known as Rohingya) by Myanmar's military.Facebook spokeswomanBudhraja explained to The Daily Beast: “We work hard to strike the right balance between enabling expression while providing a safe and respectful experience.” What is the “right balance” regarding a brutal campaign that is creating hundreds of thousands of refugees and spurring denunciations all over the world?
Facebook last May announced plans to hire anadditional 3,000 content reviewersto scrutinize and delete offensive or improper postings or false information. But catch-all notions of ""fake news"" can abet government coverups. Condemnations of Congress’ 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution were often considered “fake news” (or communist propaganda) until Americans learned how theJohnson administration deceivedthem into the Vietnam War.Allegations that the feds had any role in that Waco fire were labeled conspiratorial nonsense until 1999, when the Justice Department admitted thatthe FBI fired pyrotechnic devicesinto the ramshackle building before the conflagration. Assertions that foreign governments had any role in the 9/11 attacks were summarily condemned until recent disclosures aboutSaudi financing of the hijackers.
Unlike its role in many foreign nations, Facebook is not functioning as an official censor in the U. S. But the company’s nonchalance about engaging in the electronic equivalent of book burning abroad should spur wariness about its conduct here.There are far too many American politicians who would be happy to browbeat Facebook into silencing their critics.

"Rupert Murdoch had opportunity to fix things at FoxNews. The network had always been about “fair and balanced.” But he let his sons, James and Lachlan, take over. Now their liberal positioning is starting to hurt the network.
One wonders why he allowed them to take the reigns considering their political bent? Now it appears a conservative light may be on the horizon.
The Murdoch scions might want to re-think their positions. One thing they could do is keep their wives out of the mix. Those liberal ladies are making things worse.
Now conservative branders and thinkers are beginning to come together. Their purpose? To create a new netwprk that focuses on truth and balanced reporting. A conservative opportunity.
With Fox playing their stupidity game, investors are seeing potential. An anonymous source from the television world is making this news public.
A well-placed source close to the proposal tells Mediaite that serious discussions are underway to create an alternative conservative cable network on the belief that the Fox News Network is moving too far to the left. The source, who is engaged in the talks, says a meeting is planned for today with two prominent high-powered television executives, some underperforming conservative networks and people who have an interest and the ability to fund a new network.
The potential aim? Putting “the old band” back together. There are certainly plenty of (out-of-work?) conservative powerhouses to pick from that could star on a new network, and perhaps even some executives from within Fox News who might be lured by the new opportunity.
“I’m working on it (the new conservative channel) hot and heavy,” the source said. “It’s live, it’s real.” The new channel could come to fruition within the next 10 to 12 months, the executive said.
I would be amazing to see faces again that stand for conservatism. A new addition to the cable news industry would be incredible. It means that mainstream media would see what truth looks like.
As for FoxNews, they have time to things right. But if they keep going this route, their viewership will drop considerably. 21st Century Fox relies heavily on FoxNews income…almost 1/4 to be exact.

"Olivia Newton-John is postponing her June U. S. and Canadian concert tour dates to battle cancer.
In a release sent to Fox News, the 68-year-old revealed the back pain that initially caused her to postpone the first half of her concert tour has turned out to be breast cancer that has spread to the sacrum.
“I decided on my direction of therapies after consultation with my doctors and natural therapists and the medical team at my Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia,” she wrote.
OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN RECALLS THE SONG THAT GAVE HER 'A PANIC ATTACK'
In addition to “natural wellness therapies,” the singer/actress will also complete a short course of photon radiation therapy. Newton-John “is confident” that she will return to the stage later this year.
In 2012, 20 years after she first fought and won a battle with breast cancer, the “Grease” star launched the Olivia Newton-John Wellness and Research Centre in Australia.
She admitted to Fox News that loaning her name to the hospital building was “daunting,” but she ultimately received some parental advice.
“My mom said, ‘Well, if you’re going to help people, then you should do it,’” she said. “That was really the answer. A very simple and straightforward one.""",0
"Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson has a new book arguing that harassment of women is pervasive in society. In the book Carlson sets out an agenda to combat harassment.
Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson has a new book arguing that harassment of women is pervasive in society. In the book Carlson sets out an agenda to combat harassment.
The New York Times this week accused the Hollywood legend Harvey Weinstein of a pattern of sexual harassment stretching back decades. Those accusations sounded familiar to Gretchen Carlson, the former FOX News host. Her lawsuit last summer against the late Roger Ailes threw the Fox News Channel into a crisis. She spoke this week with NPR's David Folkenflik about what she says is systemic sexual harassment.
DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Harvey Weinstein has produced some of American cinema's most acclaimed films. He's a major Democratic Party donor and has palled around with the Clintons. The New York Times makes the case Harvey Weinstein has also been a serial sexual harasser. Gretchen Carlson praises the women who gave heft to rumors that had long swirled in Los Angeles and New York.
GRETCHEN CARLSON: If this has been going on for three decades, you have to wonder about how the company was operating to try and keep it all secret. You have to wonder about enablers who knew about this for this long and didn't find it within themselves to have the courage or the bravery to also come forward.
FOLKENFLIK: There is, Carlson says, almost invariably the same dynamic at work.
CARLSON: The powerful man has all the power. And the women who are trying to become employed or stay employed have none.
FOLKENFLIK: Carlson's new book ""Be Fierce"" depicts the American workplace as rife with sexual harassment, and she offers some solutions.
CARLSON: In so many of these cases, the women have been in their careers for decades. And they face a terrible choice where they feel incredibly alone.
FOLKENFLIK: I asked her to read this passage from the book.
CARLSON: (Reading) You may start pulling away from your colleagues. You may wonder if anyone really supports you. You'll probably hear people accusing you of being aloof and unsocial when in reality you're just coming to work, putting your head down and trying to do your best job. You ask yourself every day, how can I behave normally when I don't trust anybody?
FOLKENFLIK: That section sounded very much as though it were from the heart and from hard-earned experience. But Carlson cannot talk about what happened to her at Fox News at all. Carlson received a $20 million confidential settlement to resolve her sexual harassment suit against Roger Ailes. Carlson also received a rare public apology from the network's parent company. Other women came forward, Ailes was ousted, and many executives accused of enabling his behavior ultimately left. Two stars accused of sexual harassment themselves were also forced out, Eric Bolling and Bill O'Reilly. Yet a couple of weeks ago, O'Reilly popped back up on Fox News again.
SEAN HANNITY: And it's Bill O'Reilly. How are you? It's good to see you.
BILL O'REILLY: Hey, I'm here. I'm alive. And the spin stops here.
FOLKENFLIK: O'Reilly promoted his book and touted the importance of Fox with his former primetime colleague, Sean Hannity.
O'REILLY: This network goes, they win.
HANNITY: All right, Bill. Well, come back. Will you come back?
CARLSON: Well, my immediate reaction was WTF. I thought it was shocking and would be for any company to bring back somebody who had left the company with the circumstances that he did.
FOLKENFLIK: Fox News makes most of its journalists sign contracts requiring them to resolve conflicts in arbitration, out of public view. Fox and Ailes and O'Reilly have together paid tens of millions of dollars to keep complaints secret. Yesterday the New York Times called on Harvey Weinstein to release women from non-disclosure agreements.
CARLSON: We should try to tackle this issue so women aren't forced into these situations where they can't tell their stories. But this is how we've come to decide in a culture how we're going to resolve these things. They're either going to go to secret arbitration or they're going to be settled probably.
FOLKENFLIK: Fox News announced yesterday that its chief lawyer would be taking a voluntary leave. Dianne Brandi's role in using payments to conceal Ailes' behavior is under review by federal investigators. David Folkenflik, NPR News, New York.

"Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg calls anti-Semitic ad-targeting ‘a Fail’ and changes the company’s software            Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.    You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.
Facebook is making changes to its ad systems in the wake of an investigative report that its software enabled advertisers to find viewers who had identified themselves as “Jew-Haters” and otheranti-Semitic terms on the social network, the company said Wednesday.  The changes were announced Wednesday afternoon in a Facebook post written by Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. That fact that Sandberg weighed in is a reflection of how the reports have shaken the highest rungs of the company. “The fact that hateful terms were even offered as options was totally inappropriate and a fail on our part,” Sandberg wrote. “We never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way —and that is on us. And we did not find it ourselves —and that is also on us.” In the post, Sandberg said the company would be stepping up enforcement by adding more human review and oversight to the company’s automated systems.  The changes come at a moment when Facebook is reckoning with a growing number of nefarious ways its largely automated systems can be manipulated. Earlier this month, Facebook revealed that a Russian “troll farm” had spent $100,000 on politically oriented ads during the election, and the company shut down 470 Russian-associated pages and accounts. That investigation continues, and the company has provided information to congressional investigators and to Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who is leading the Russia probe.  The company's latest issue with anti-Semitic ads arose out of an investigation from the non-profit news outlet ProPublica. Using Facebook’s ad-categories, ProPublica was able to target the Facebook feeds of 2,300 users who had expressed interest in the topics of “Jew Hater,” “How to burn jews” or “History of why jews ruin the world.” Those users had violated Facebook’s policies by entering the offensive terms into the employer or education sections of their profiles. Facebook’s ad system allows advertisers to target by employer or education and allows people to suggest their own categories.  After the anti-Semitic targeting capabilities were exposed, Facebook disabled the tool. In her post, Sandberg said the company had reinstated 5,000 of the most commonly used terms, such as ""nurse, teacher, or dentistry."" Additional targeting options, she said, would have ""more manual review,"" but she didn't specify whether each new targeting option would be reviewed manually or whether the company would need to hire more people to conduct so many manual reviews. Facebook did not respond to questionson the matter. Sandberg also said that the company was creating a program to encourage people to report abuses of its ad system. Facebook already has systems through which people can report and flag abusive content, as well as content they suspect is fake news. Sandberg's style is to speak from personal experience, which she evoked in her blog post. ""Hate has no place on Facebook – and as a Jew, as a mother, and as a human being, I know the damage that can come from hate,"" she said.

"The continuing escalation of verbal threats by North Korea and harsh warnings from American officials has sparked questions about whether military conflict between the U. S. and Pyongyang is possible, and if so, what it could look like.
Two foreign policy experts stressed in interviews with ABC News both that because North Korean leaderKim Jong Un’s main priority will always be to ensure continuation of his family’s regime he will likely hesitate to take any steps that could threaten their control.
“The whole goal is regime survival,” said ABC News aviation consultant Steve Ganyard, a retiredMarine Corpscolonel.
Scott Snyder, a senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, told ABC News that Kim probably knows he can’t usenuclear weaponsfor offensive purposes if he wants to survive and “what we know of Kim Jong Un is that he wants to survive.”
Aside from Kim’s interest in self-preservation, it remains unclear whether North Korea has all of the necessary technology to make an offensive strike possible.
Ganyard said North Korea would have to have four essentials in place before making nuclear strike: a nuclear weapon, missiles, technology that allows a missile to re-enter the earth’s atmosphere without igniting, and the capability to target missiles.
But it remains unknown if the North Koreans have the re-entry or target technology necessary for such an attack.
“At this stage, even with the [Defense Intelligence Agency] report out there, I would still say that they have an unproven capability to deliver because there has not been a judgment yet about their ability to master re-entry to the earth’s atmosphere, so that applies for now to the continental United States,” Snyder said.
“But that may not apply in months,” he added.
Despite the reasons why North Korea may be unlikely to mount a nuclear strike, the country’s threatening rhetoric has not died down.
Several U. S. cities or territories are within a range which experts believe North Korea’s missiles could potentially reach.",1
"We know there was no collusion between Trump and Russia, despite Democrats pushing it nonstop. As Trey Gowdy pointed out, there are other things they SHOULD be focused on.
“You have the dissemination — the felonious dissemination of classified information that will jeopardize 320 million Americans, and I would love it if our friends in the mainstream media would focus on the leak as much as they did the wiretap tweet,” Gowdy said to FBI Director Comey.
FBI Director James Comey did his best to protect Obama throughout the hearing and refused to address the pink elephant in the room… the incredible amount of leaks currently happening in the intelligence community.
This case is far from closed and Mr. Gowdy made that exact point, stating that Nunes had his chance to prove his case today, but failed to do so. They continue to make allegations, which constantly are proven false, and then ignore the real issues at hand.
The fact remains that there WERE illegal leaks designed to undermine the presidency. And those who started the leaks still need to be found and brought to justice.
By focusing on the fake Trump-Russia conspiracy narrative, and mocking the president’s famous “wiretap” tweets, the mainstream liberal media are missing the point: real criminals are still at large, and we’re letting them get away with treason!
The real issue lies within the “deep state” and the intelligence community workers who remain free to leak out information to the media without repercussions.
Gowdy, in his usual manner, was calm and collected while making his statements, but the message is clear: those in charge need to WAKE UP and get their fingers ready to plug the leaks in the government dam.
Leaking information to the press to push the liberal agenda is bad enough, but it could get a lot worse from here on out if these insiders aren’t stopped. If an intelligence community employee is willing to illegally leak information to the press, what makes you think they wouldn’t leak something even more vital to our enemies?
It’s time for investigators to heed Gowdy’s words and start looking for the source of the problem. Instead of coming on the news every other day to make false allegations and spread more fake news, it is the time they start concentrating on bringingreal criminals to justice!

Who Is Sorcha Faal?
Sister Maria Theresa is the 73rd Sorcha Faal of the Sorcha Faal Order, Elected as Mother Superior 3 February 2007 whose order comprises 18 Monasteries in Ireland, Russia, Egypt, Lebanon, and the United States.
The Order of Sorcha Faal was established in 588 (BCE) in Tara, County Meath, Ireland, whose founder was the oldest daughter of King Zedekiah, Tamar Tephi.
The name, Sorcha Faal, comes from the ancient Gaeilge branch of the Goidelic languages of Ireland and has the meaning of:  Sorcha, She Who Brings Light, and Faal, the Dark and Barren Place.
The Sisters of Sorcha Faal are a cloistered order (kept away from the outside world; sheltered) devoted to ancient Biblical, religious and scientific study whose only contact is through intermediaries.
The WhatDoesItMean.com website used to disseminate Sorcha Faal reports was created for and donated to the Sisters of Sorcha Faal in 2003 by a small group of American computer experts led by the late global technology guru Wayne Green (1922-2013) to counter the propaganda being used by the West to promote their illegal 2003 invasion of Iraq.

"The left has been having a field day since news broke of Michael Flynn’s intention to plead guilty to charges that stemmed from the investigation into “Russian collusion.” Unfortunately for those praising the reports that he is going to point fingers at President Donald Trump and take him down, they may want to hold off on their celebrations because there are at least two important details that the liberal media got dead wrong, and everyone needs to know.
Seeking to do anything they could to delegitimize Trump’s presidency, the liberal media has been beating the Russian collusion drum to death for well over a year after Donald Trump won the 2016 Presidential Election. Now, as Robert Mueller’s special investigation team has announced charges against former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, the liberal media has already begun to celebrate – but things aren’t as they seem.
Before long, reports were circulating saying that Flynn “feels he has been abandoned by President Trump” and was ready to point fingers. Specifically, a Mediate article states that Flynn was set to “testify Trump ‘directed him’ to contact Russia” and alluded that this would take Trump down.
Too bad for the liberals who are already celebrating, they may want to hold off on the confetti and champagne as there’s just one thing the entire country needs to know – it’s all “fake news.” Yet again, we’re seeing fake news at its finest as the left desperately grabs at whatever straws they can in order to attack Trump.
Although they think that they have the high ground, they certainly don’t. Flynn isn’t in trouble for talking to the Russians because what he did was not criminal. However, it’s the fact that he lied about it that’s resulted in official charges and, soon enough, a guilty plea.
Furthermore, the leftist hack Brian Ross over at ABC claims that the network was told by a Flynn “confidant” that the former National Security Advisor will testify against Trump. Of course, we’ve seen enough times by now that these so-called “confidants” or “anonymous sources” are just a cover for the networks to spread unsubstantiated and flagrantly false reports – or, fake news, if you will.
As if that wasn’t enough, it seems that the liberal media was completely wrong in their reporting as Trump isn’t directly involved in the slightest. According to The Daily Caller, “Additional reporting by Fox News indicates that Flynn was directed to contact Russians by a senior member of the transition team, not by Trump when he was a candidate, as ABC News initially reported.”
Just like that, the world was turned upside down on its head because of the fake news. Social media ignited, the stock markets tanked, and the world was good for the left, but they’re wrong. However, yet again, they’ve fallen for and propagated nothing more than fake news – the same thing that got them into trouble and essentially lost them the election in the first place.
Of course, the punishment for the neglect and willful ignorance is just coming out as Trump’s attorney, Ty Cobb, just bashed liberal morons everywhere over the head. Setting the record straight, he released a scathing statement.“The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,”Trump attorney Ty Cobb said, speaking of the Flynn developments. “Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn,” Cobb added in his prepared statement.
“The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counsel’s work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion,” Cobb continued, according toCNBC.
The left is really digging a hole for themselves. Still, they don’t realize that their own dishonesty turned the American people against them. Rather than acknowledge what they did wrong, they instead have chosen to deny and continue in the same fashion, twisting facts in an attempt to suit their narrative.
Yet again, they have jumped the gun and chosen to spread fake news because they thought they could benefit from it rather than do their research and responsibly put out the truth. The liberal media is fake news – and at this point, they’ve lost all credibility. So, it’s up to us to spread the truth.",1
"The fight for truth and answers regarding the Planet X system was raging behind the headlines these past months. If anyone cared to notice. While most talked pedophiles and Weinstein, corruption and Clinton, Planet X disclosure stories are being injected into world wide mainstream media sources.
The recent spat of disguised disclosure began in September with a host of articles from the Express, printing a story on a September 23rd Doomsday because of David’s Meade assertion it was revelation twelve.
In a preceding article the next week the Express released the tidbit that, “News4KTLA has reported that NASA had issued a terrifying advisory about the trajectory of a“rogue planet” known as “Nibiru” or “Planet X”, saying it would “intersect Earth’s orbit, with potentially disastrous consequences”.The report said: “NASA has known about the mystery planet for years, but declined to warn us … until now.”
After this the articles around the British and Anglo American mainstream came a fast and furious torrent of Nibiru articles.
After the Express laid that red pill on its readers the mighty Washington Post released the next article in the trickle down disclosure on the subject. This article said of Meade that, “He also claims that aplanet called Nibiru, which has been debunked by NASA as a hoax, is headed toward Earth. When it passes the planet later this year, Meade claims, catastrophe in the form of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves and others would ensue. All of this is“the story of the century,” Meade said on his website, but he says it’s distorted and misrepresented by the mainstream media. He said some publications have exaggerated his words and falsely reported that he believes the world would endthis weekend.”
Falsely reported? In the mainstream media? No way!
Then being the mainstream you have Globalist toilet paper Time magazine weigh in on the debate, with a headline of “David Meade Said the World Was Going to End Last Weekend. Now He Says It’s Really Happening in October,” the pour guy being taken out of context every time by the frigging CIA seeded journalists.
Aol joined the fray with a headline, “Doomsday Conspiracy theorist trying to convince people it’s the end of the world.” They didn’t say it wasn’t the end? Are you convinced now? Then AOL set the new date. Without any sort of fact saying, “Mark your calendars forOctober 15th, because that’s when the apocalypse begins, apparently.’
Across the pond it was the Ruskies turn to twist the truth. Putin must have planned it all along the bastard. RT released a headline adding a new spin, ‘Doomsayer predicts rise of Antichrist, 7 years of chaos & Planet X smashing into Earth ‘That’s according to conspiracy theorist, David Meade, and reported by everyone from Newsweek, Time and The Sun. If you need a refresher, he’s the same guy who said doomsday was going to take place on September 23rd, 2017. Meade thinks it’s all because of Planet X, or Nibiru, which he previously claimed would hit Earth on September 23rd and wipe billions off the planet.”
The truth keep rolling out with the mainstream connecting earthquakes to the approach of the rogue planet(s) and after the Octber 15th Dooom passed it continues with new articles this week. The latest from Daily Star headlines today, “Doom planet Nibiru ‘ALREADY in solar system and will trigger apocalypse NEXT YEAR’ This is there headlines. The capitalization almost seems urgent and there is again a host of articles like this one from Christian Post, “Planet X Already Visible to the Naked Eye, Theorists Claim”.
Far to many big networks are warning us for the whole phenomenon to be explained away as a simple lens flare. To the critical thinker it appears the mainstream are disclosing the core facts about this subject, familiarizing the mob with the term Nibiru and Planet X, desensitizing the people to imminent doom, now proclaimed on a monthly basis by the trustworthy media…ahem, wink wink. It is the truth disguised with distortions and lies perhaps, but the truth of what is being seen on skycams across the world.
The objects in the images below from 4 countries are the reason the truth about the Planet X/Nibiru is being forced out of the mainstream media. Prepare and Prosper.",1

'Nothing insurmountable'
Ireland, previously the bookmakers' favorite to secure the tournament, was let down in the ""venues and host cities"" criteria. It ranked third with 72.25%, while France was second with 75.88% and South Africa rated highest with 78.97%.
But Irish bid committee chairman Dick Spring insists they're not giving up yet.

""We absolutely believe Ireland can secure the tournament for 2023.""

Despite the nation's readmission in 1992 to international rugby, after years of apartheid-enforced sporting isolation, South Africa used home advantage so well that the debutants reached the World Cup final in 1995.
The sporting, political and human drama was told in John Carlin's book ""Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation"" and was made into the movie ""Invictus,"" with Morgan Freeman playing Mandela.
Carlin tells the story of the moment on the day of the final when white South Africans took a man they once considered a terrorist into their hearts.
""The day's crowning moment came before the game had even begun, when Mandela went out onto the field, before a crowd of 65,000 that was 95% white, wearing the green Springbok jersey, the old symbol of oppression, beloved of his apartheid jailers,"" he wrote.
""There was a moment of jaw-dropping disbelief, a sharp collective intake of breath, and suddenly the crowd broke into a chant, which grew steadily louder, of 'Nelson! Nelson! Nelson!'""
Two hours later, the day's images adopted iconic status as the ""Rainbow Nation"" beat New Zealand to win the tournament, precipitating widespread celebrations, increased harmony and a mixture of both pride and hope to a South Africa in desperate need of reconciliation.
The photo of team captain Francois Pienaar receiving the trophy from Mandela, who was wearing the No. 6 jersey associated with the Springboks' Afrikaner skipper, now takes a place of pride at the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg.

"Fans of the Netflix prison drama ""Orange Is the New Black"" face a dilemma after hackers claimed to have leaked most of the new season's 13 episodes this weekend — wait more than a month for the official release date or give in and download the pirated shows.
The hack or hackers — who go by ""thedarkoverlord"" — said they had demanded a ""modest"" ransom from Netflix to stop the leak, ""yet they continue to remain unresponsive.""
""With this information in mind (and the fact that leaving people on cliffhangers isn't fun) we've decided to release Episodes 2-10 of 'Orange Is The New Black' Season 5 after many lengthy discussions at the office where alcohol was present,"" the group said on an online computer code sharing site.
The industry site Torrentfreak reported that ""thedarkoverlord"" also released the season premiere.
NBC News hasn't independently verified the authenticity of the files, but Netflix didn't deny that they were real as hundreds of clips and excerpts began flooding social media beginning Saturday night, alternately thrilling and dismaying the show's rabid fans.
Netflix told NBC News in a two-sentence statement only that a production company used by several major TV studios ""had its security compromised"" and that ""the appropriate law enforcement authorities are involved.""
The hackers appeared to confirm that the leaked episodes — which Netflix had planned to release June 9 — were harvested from a third-party production vendor.
""We were so early when we acquired the copies that post hadn't gotten around to Episodes 11-13,"" they said, using an industry shorthand term for ""post-production.""
The hacker or hackers warned that more Netflix material could be leaked soon — and not just the streaming service's proprietary work. It specifically named ABC, National Geographic, Fox and IFC (formerly the Independent Film Channel) as being ""on the feasting menu.""
""Our offer(s) are still on the table — for now,"" the group said.
""Orange Is the New Black,"" based on the 2010 book by Piper Kernan about her time in the federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, built an intensely loyal following in its first four seasons, and those fans were torn by the unauthorized posting of most of the fifth season:",0

Breitbart News is riding high amid its reunion with executive chairman Steve Bannon. After announcing Bannon’s return on Friday, who officially left his post as White House chief strategist hours prior, Breitbart officials say they are “fired up” about the future of the populist right-wing publication, promising an “aggressive expansion” and renewed focus on its signature bombastic reporting-style.“I think we definitely are planning on stepping up our game,” Breitbart News Washington editor Matthew Boyle said during the outlet’s weekly SiriusXM show on Saturday.“’[W]e’re planning a lot of aggressive expansion and much more aggressive reporting than we’ve already been doing,” he added. Boyle, one of Bannon’s closest allies at Breitbart both prior to and during his tenure serving President Donald Trump, said that the outlet was electrified by Bannon’s return, casting the dynamic at the site during his time away as akin to that of “a pirate ship without a captain.” “We’ve been a pirate ship without a captain for a year,” Boyle said. “We’re thrilled to have our captain back.”Boyle’s comments echo that of Bannon’s, who told the Weekly Standard Friday he was “jacked up” to be back with Breitbart’s cast of renegade conservatives. Prior to his White House departure, friends and associates of Bannon said he felt restless with the constraints of the West Wing and that he yearned to return to his role as a political outsider. It was time for “Bannon da Barbarian,” he reportedly told them. The new Bannon era at Breitbart is likely to feature the publication doubling-down on its attacks on centrist Republicans.Bannon declared Friday during an interview with Bloomberg that he and Breitbart would be setting their sights on who they saw as enemies of the Trump administration going forward.

“I’m leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents -- on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America,” Bannon said.Boyle expanded on the sentiment by putting “establishment Republicans” on notice Saturday, while cautioning the Trump administration that it would not be able to carry out its agenda if it strayed too far to the center.“Trump has to work with conservatives. It’s the only way he can get major big ticket items done,” Boyle said. “What the president has to do is stick to the agenda that won him the election.”Boyle also fired off a few warning shots to former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci and 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch, the son of Fox News chief Rupert Murdoch, both of whom have made critical remarks about Trump over the past week.The Breitbart writer criticized James Murdoch over his open letter denouncing Trump’s response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last weekend, saying it “read like leftist diatribe.” He also called out Scaramucci for criticism about Trump to left-leaning publications this week. Boyle also reiterated Breitbart’s commitment to their oppositional mantra of constant warfare – mirroring a tweet sent by editor at large James Pollak on Friday.",0
"A right-wing blogger and filmmaker who promised to publish the names of male journalists who were cited by female colleagues as sexual harassers on the list of “Shitty Media Men” told POLITICO on Wednesday that he was holding back, calling the men on the list and consulting with his lawyer.
Blogger Mike Cernovich had announced his intention to publish the list “in a few minutes” after obtaining it on Saturday and later identified two journalists on it and the accusations against them. The list contains the names of more than 70 men in media who were alleged to have committed acts ranging for “creepy” direct messages to rape, according to women who added their names as the list was passed around in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.
Former New Republic literary editor Leon Wieseltier was one whose name was on the list, according to a copy obtained by POLITICO, and he may have been its first casualty. On Tuesday, an organization supported by Laurene Powell Jobs, the philanthropist and widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, severed ties with Wieseltier over “inappropriate workplace conduct” at the magazine he worked at for more than three decades. Wieseltier had been accused of “workplace harassment” on the list.
“Shitty Media Men,” was never intended for publication and was shut down after BuzzFeed reported on its existence on Oct. 12 and noted that some of the accused hail from organizations such as The New York Times, The New Yorker, Mother Jones and even BuzzFeed.
Journalists have been sharing screenshots of the list for nearly two weeks, but news organizations have remained understandably skittish about amplifying the claims without substantiation. It’s rare that news organizations can still act as a gatekeeper for information given the ability for emerging media players, perhaps less bound to traditional newsroom standards, to publish at will.
On Oct. 16, Cernovich tweeted that he’d pay $10,000 for a copy of the list, an offer most mainstream news organizations would not make because they prohibit paying for information. Cernovich told POLITICO that a source sent him the list but “was insistent on not accepting anything” for it. “I’m not endorsing any of the accusations contained on the list,” he added. “Rather, I am reporting that others have made those accusations. It’s a tightrope to walk. That’s probably why the full list hasn’t been posted online by anyone, even me.”
Cernovich’s decision to withhold publication of the full list, at least for a while, reflects both the legal sensitivities surrounding the charges and the extent to which it could roil newsrooms. Not only are newsrooms grappling with how to report on the allegations, but some also have employees among the accused.
“We're committed to a comfortable and safe environment for everyone, but we just are not going to comment on unsourced, 3rd-hand allegations repackaged by an alt-right blogger and Pizzagate conspiracy theorist.” Mother Jones editor Clara Jeffery told POLITICO.
Cernovich was a proponent of the bogus conspiracy theory, known as Pizzagate, that Democrats were running an underground child sex ring at a Washington pizza parlor.
One major question for news organizations is whether names on the list ought to be immediately investigated. POLITICO reached out to several publications with writers who appeared on the list, including The New York Times.
“We take such allegations seriously,” a Times spokesperson said, “and encourage any employee who believes they have been the target of misconduct to report it through one of many channels including an anonymous helpline. As a matter of policy, we investigate all complaints.”
There have been no internal complaints, and thus no investigations, against the Times staff members on the list, according to a source familiar with the issue.
Publications like New York Magazine and BuzzFeed have taken a different tack.
“New York Media takes very seriously any allegations or complaints raised regarding harassment, discrimination, hostility, or any inappropriate conduct directed toward our employees, contingent workers, clients, suppliers, or anyone we do business with,” a New York Magazine spokesperson said.
“In the case of any active New York Media employees who may appear on the ‘men in media’ list, we have reviewed whether any type of action is appropriate and have acted accordingly. It is New York Media's policy not to disclose publicly any findings or actions taken as a result of this process so as to preserve the confidential and sensitive nature of these matters.”
The names of several writers at BuzzFeed, which was the first outlet to write about the list, appeared on the spreadsheet. On Tuesday, Lenke Taylor, the company’s chief people officer, sent a staffwide memo that said, “We look into all allegations of harassment and related conduct, and act on them accordingly.”
“If you prefer to stay anonymous, we launched a tip line last year to provide that option,” she wrote. “We have confidentially investigated and acted on incidents raised in the past, both via the tip line or to us directly or indirectly.”
A BuzzFeed News spokesperson added, “We cannot discuss specific personnel matters, but we take allegations of inappropriate conduct extremely seriously, including anonymous ones.”
According to one BuzzFeed staffer, the names on the list weren’t a total surprise to many — and that the reputations of the men named on it preceded them. “Nothing in the spreadsheet really seemed like new information,” she said. “It’s less of a big topic than you might expect.”
Part of the reason the list hasn’t roiled the newsroom, she said, is that “I genuinely do not think BuzzFeed has a cultural/harassment problem.”
The list doesn’t appear to be a complete snapshot of allegations within the media industry because it focuses primarily on New York-based digital outlets and the literary world. There are few men named who work for Washington-based outlets and television networks. And there are similar conversations playing out in other private forums in the wake of the Weinstein scandal.
Former female New Republic staffers shared their personal stories about Wieseltier over the past week on another private list.
Separate from the list, Vox Media fired editorial director Lockhart Steele on Thursday after he engaged “in conduct that is inconsistent with our core values,” CEO Jim Bankoff wrote to staff in a memo, amid a sexual harassment allegation against Steele by a former Vox Media employee.
Bankoff did not elaborate on the allegations against Steele, and said in a staff meeting that Vox is still investigating, according to the Awl.",0
"Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly said Tuesday that she did not come forward sooner with allegations that former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes sexually harassed her because it would have been a “suicide mission” for her career.
During an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” abouther new book, “Settle for More,” Kelly said that in the beginning of her career at Fox News Ailes tried to kiss her three times in his office and that when she rejected his advances “he asked me when my contract was up.”
“As soon as I left his office I called a lawyer, and I did bring the matter to a supervisor at Fox News,” Kelly added.
Kelly said her supervisor “vouched for Roger’s character, assured me that he was a good man, that he was likely just smitten and that I should try to avoid him, which I did.”
She said Ailes stopped harassing her after she avoided him for six months.
Despite her own experience with Ailes, Kelly said that she wasn’t initially sure what to believe when her former colleague Gretchen Carlson alleged that Ailes destroyed her career after she rejected his advances.
“He and I had gone on to have nine years of a healthy, working relationship, and so in my mind I had attributed to he was interested in me, he was having a marital difficulty, perhaps he was just interested in having an extramarital affair,” Kelly said. “I wrestled with what to do because I wasn’t sure what the truth was about Roger.”
Kelly said she decided to call 21st Century Fox Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch after Carlson’s allegations came to light to tell him about her her own experience with Ailes. Within days, Murdoch hired a law firm to investigate him.
“What I wanted was for it to be an open and honest investigation into him, that’s all I really wanted, because I didn’t know whether it was just me or just Gretchen,” Kelly said. “That’s why I called Lachlan Murdoch to tell him— it didn’t bring me any joy— but just to tell him that this did happen to me 10 years earlier and that they needed to take a hard look at who they had running the company.”
“I cooperated with that investigation, and I think it wound up as it should have,” she added.
Kelly called Ailes’ actions “disturbing” but said she didn’t immediately come forward because “realistically, that would have been a suicide mission for me and my career.”
“I wasn’t Megyn Kelly of today. I had no power, and he was on the cover of industry magazines as the most powerful man in news,” she said. “There was no one to go to.”
Ailes denied Kelly’s allegations in a statement given to ABC News through his attorney.
Kelly also addressed President-elect Donald Trump’s frequent attacks on her during his presidential campaign after she asked him a question he didn’t like at a debate.
“It definitely posed challenges when he was coming at me so relentlessly and causing security issues in my life and the life of my family, but I did it,” Kelly said. “It was a test of me as a person and a professional.”
Kelly said that her meeting with the Manhattan billionairein Trump Tower was a turning point in their professional relationship.
“He came after me like a dog with a bone for nine months, but finally, when I went to see him at Trump Tower— and believe me, I was not conciliatory towards him— we got past it,” she said.
Kelly declined to say whether she will stay at Fox News when her contract expires.
“I’m very grateful that Fox News has given me the 12 years I’ve had there and that they want me to stay,” she said. “In my opinion, the Murdochs, who are running Fox News Channel now, are honorable men who want to do what’s right and who have a great vision for Fox News.”
Kelly said she will do what is best for her family. “As much as I love my job I love those three little lives that my husband and I have brought into the world,” she said. “This is my philosophy, that I need to settle for more, so I’m going to do that.”",0

BY CHRISTINA KIELY
""We've got a guy over here. Swears he didn't hear anything. He was busy getting his 'after-dinner mint' from that lady of the night over there when it happened. But he's all raised-up 'cuz he told his wife he was picking up milk at the deli and is late getting home.""
Hearing stuff like this from New York City police officers was normal for me in 2003 and 2004. I was embedded with several departments of the NYPD over the course of months, shooting a documentary series for ABC News called ""NYPD 24/7.""
It was on this job that I met now retired Det. Kenny Silvia and the family of Burke O'Brien.
O'Brien was a redheaded 25-year-old from Chicago who was visiting New York City for a job interview in January 2003. He was killed after being shot in the chest on a quiet block in the Lower East Side at 4 a.m. after a night out with friends.
When I arrived, I was replacing my colleague who had followed the first 36 or so hours of the O'Brien shooting.
I knew I'd stepped into a strange and unexpected case, but I had no idea I'd still be following it 14 years later.
Riding along with the police is exactly what I love about my job. I go where most people can’t or won’t or shouldn’t go, to observe the real people behind the scenes and experience the day-to-day lives that only insiders know about.
After eight months of spending nearly seven-days-a-week with a variety of NYPD units, I collected stories for years to come and developed a more nuanced view of the people behind the badges.
In my time in the field (alone with a small camera), I was assigned to follow Crime Scene Unit detectives, Special Victims detectives and the entire Manhattan South Homicide Squad. I was present for nearly 30 homicides, covering a very wide variety of victims (though several were discovered to be suicides upon investigation).
Watching everything through my camera lens, I sometimes forgot that I was actually there too. ""This is a frightening situation,"" I'd think, somehow not feeling afraid. ""Someone could get killed here.""
Even if you are watching from the sidelines, you can't help but become affected by this kind of work. It's a unique experience to dip into other people's lives for months at a time and then return to your own.
For a while after I returned to normal life, I realized I'd become an apologist for the NYPD. I knew why: Not only had I gotten into the thrill of it, but I had bonded with many detectives whom I knew were not only good people but essential to the daily lives of average citizens. They were also people who had made me feel personally protected no matter which dark, sketchy, raging corner of town we found ourselves in.
I was starting to understand. The force is a club that makes regular guys feel special and smart guys feel heroic. People want to get in and fit in. The getting in isn’t the hard part. You don’t have to be rich or come from a legacy or even be exceptional at anything -- just work hard and pass the tests. The problem is fitting in. If you don't fit into the club, you could end up dead. It's like a playground but with guns. If no one wants to play with you that can mean no one will be there for you, watching your back when you need it most.
Some detectives asked me what some of my impressions of cops (detectives in particular) were after a few months. On one hand, I was really impressed with how smart and perceptive many of these men and women were. Conversely, I was disappointed by how petty and immature even some senior bosses could be. At best, I was watching fast-talking, deeply experienced puzzle masters in action. But then it could also be like junior high, only with a lot of language I can't repeat here.
I got the feeling that most of the detectives thought that I was anti-gun. I didn't let on that they were right because I also needed to be accepted by the club if they were going to open up to me. So I learned how to fire a 9mm Glock at the NYPD practice range.
It was intense. The movies just don't do justice to how loud a gun going off in a room is. It is deafening! I was so nervous that my palms started to sweat. But then the instructor told me what to do and... I was good at it! My heart was racing and my head was full of my own rants about the evils of firearms, but what I really felt was talented.
And I understood the feeling. I mean, I really got it -- the strange, exciting, instant power of guns. It was scary because with every homicide I also saw (and smelled) what guns can do: brains clumped on my shoes, blood puddles, the sight and putrid stink of three-day old dead people (that's why some detectives told me they smoke cigars and others smoke pipes), lives cut short, families destroyed. It made sense when I learned later that the officers with the most experience almost never use their guns.
After my shooting lesson, the first thing I did was take my target around and show all the cops I knew that I had shot a paper guy. Cops say that they are not a trusting bunch, but from that moment on, many of the detectives opened up to me a lot. Once the cops started talking to me -- really talking to me -- I could see why they wanted to be a part of the force and also see the things that make people distrust them. Perhaps at the heart of this distrust is that they often work with people at the worst moments of their lives, creating a different lens for seeing the world than most people have.
But my understanding of detectives changed the most when I found myself following the murder of Burke O'Brien and met Det. Silvia.
Silvia didn't need me to be a good shot or anything else. He just wanted me to be a good listener and trustworthy person to have around while he faced the most challenging case of his career as an investigator.
Silvia cared only about doing his job well and doing his best for the O'Brien family (before he had even met them).
He kept an open mind, re-asking the questions that already seemed answered. And he kept at it long after the homicide team moved on to other cases, the weather turning from bitter cold to sweltering heat.
Silvia felt that he owed it to the O'Brien family to find Burke's killer. Unfortunately, he didn't.
Our original show aired and Silvia left the 7th Precinct and eventually retired from the force after his 20 years of service.
Then, in summer 2014, more than 10 years after I had been embedded with the NYPD, Silvia called me.
He was still determined to solve this case.

"Some of us face depression like it’s a daily face of life. For some it’s a vague, but indiscriminating heaviness that comes and goes like a dark cloud. Some use metaphors to describe their feelings like a black hole – for others it’s a “pit of despair” and still others feel as though they are drowning.
This one article isn’t going to solve all that, but we’d like to point out that most psychology-based articles on the subject will merely reiterate the need for treatment (drugs, psycho-therapy) and not offer a solution. Those things are everyone’s choice – but what can you do RIGHT NOW if you are sinking in quicksand? We would like to offer a few ideas.
The above metaphors are all about being trapped, stuck, sucked in, or crushed by some unseen pressure. We’d like to offer ideas that metaphorically lift up and lighten the weight of a gloomy mood. We want to encourage more upward and outward energy when we’re feeling stuck.
5 Weird Mood Hacks Sure to Quickly Lift You Up1. Talk to Someone ASAP
Especially someone you like. You may not actually be an introvert or a homebody as is the popular trend. You may actually be depressed and in need of human contact. Isolation is now considered a silent killer. Take it from this former agoraphobe – isolation will keep you further steeped in anxiety and confusion, unable to get out. Even calling or texting someone you care about can lift the moody veil nearly instantly. Schedule times to talk or hang out with friends! If that’s not an option consider Meetup.com, a gym, coffee shop or even an anonymous 12-step program.
Mind and body are connected, so when something is physically wrong your mind can experience it, too, as another warning. Irritability and anxiety can be one of the most overlooked signs of dehydration. If you find yourself in a crying spell or in a state of panic – drink water immediately! Hydration from water can give you energy and wakefulness like nothing else – not even espresso.
It sounds counter-intuitive, but helping someone else when you need help can actually get you out of a weird head space. Pick up kitties at a shelter! Take your most comedic friend so that it becomes fun to do a good deed and not a solemn duty. Infuse the experience with humor and leave your burdens at home as you lift someone else’s. It’s been said that one hour of volunteering per week is like taking a Valium – well, then!
Or literally any other kind of movement in the world. Dance, bounce, run, kick and play. Walk the neighbor’s dog, let the cat chase strings as you run or babysit and take the kiddos to the park. Cleaning the house totally counts, and then you have that extra sense of accomplishment afterward.
The problem with depressing feelings is that they can be physically debilitating when physical activity is actually one of the most important ways to get a grip on it. Movement gets things out of the body. Even rabbits zip around in funny-looking circles after they escape a trap in order to burn off that extra adrenaline rush. Unfortunately, we humans are more likely to turn on the TV and create more adrenaline rushes while we sit there.
They are easy to do and take little time. They are an instant lift. Just two minutes of jumping jacks can burn 200 calories over the remainder of the day or night. Nearly everyone can do two minutes a day and then you can always say you exercised.
Physical activity builds body strength (and mind strength!) and it even builds up the good kind of bacteria in your gut, which can further boost your mood.
5. Get Off the Bloody Internet and Create Something!
More and more research is starting to whisper about the correlation between screen time and lowered mood states. I cringe with regret when I think of what I could have been doing with the last decade of my life for every minute I spent on Facebook. Or heck, just researching ways to “fix” myself.
Virtual reality is just another aspect of life that needs boundaries. We need to set timers and find ways to connect with the here and now or we’ll lose those moments forever. This goes back to the social isolation and the lack of movement that we mentioned earlier. Unencumbered screen time is cutting into other important areas of life that are non-negotiable. The next time you log on to peek at an ex-girlfriend or look up ways to solve your past – set a timer and be done.

By the way, this article was written entirely off-line and I cannot tell you how much more peaceful that was.
Speaking of writing – isn’t it time you create something you enjoy in life? This can be anything from a journal entry, a meal or your favorite pastime.
Harvest those minutes away from the data-hive and create the life you want to wake up and jump out of bed to see.
The above tips are merely overlooked methods of self-care in the new world. We must adapt and overcome, but part of that adaptation requires the empowerment to take back what’s rightfully yours.

"On the heels of major shakeups at the Fox NewsNetwork, an alternative conservative network is being actively discussed amongst conservative fat cats.
A well-placed source close to the proposal tells Mediaite that serious discussions are underway to create an alternative conservative cable network onthe belief that the Fox News Network ismoving too far to the left. Thesource, who is engaged in the talks, says a meeting is planned for today with two prominent high-powered television executives, some underperforming conservative networksand people who have an interest and the ability to fund a new network.
The potential aim? Putting “the old band” back together. There arecertainly plenty of (out-of-work?) conservative powerhouses to pickfrom that could star on a new network, and perhaps even some executives from within Fox News who might be lured by the new opportunity. Could the new channelinclude stars likethe ousted Bill O’Reilly, who didn’t waste much time hitting the podcast wavesafter he was fired amida sexual harassment scandal? CouldTomi Lahren, the conservativemega star, who was recently sidelined at The Blaze alsotakeon a prominent role? The exact “who”won’t be clear until the deal is more defined but the source says the pitch is that the network could immediately reach at least 85 million homes.
This news comes on the heels of a long profile in last weekend’sNew York Times which paintsa picture of a changing Fox News Networkwith Murdoch’s sons, James and Lachlan, CEO and co-chairman of parent company 21st Century Fox, at the helm. The piece struck fearinto the mindsof some Fox News’ hardcore conservatives with talk of the sons wanting to ridthe company “of the old-guard culture on which their father built his empire” and bringing “a warmer and fuzzier workplace” that would move away from an “anti-politically correct environment.”
On Thursday,New York Magazine‘s Gabe Sherman, a constant thorn in the side of Fox News,reportedthat “sweeping management changes” may be coming to the network as well.Sherman’s reportcited three anonymoussources that contend that the network’s co-President Bill Shine recently asked the Murdoch sons to release a statement in support of him amid the roiling lawsuits and scandals. Both Fox News and 21 Century Fox havevigorously denied that Shine made such a request but thereport by Sherman prompted arather mysterious tweet about the “total end of the FNC as we know it” by the network’s biggestremaining star,Sean Hannity:
“I just don’t see FoxNews and Sean having a long relationship. If Seanbecomes available,youhave 100 percent turnover in primetime and a huge opportunity,”atelevision executive, who didn’t want to be identified, but is involved in some of the talks, toldMediaite.
“I’m working on it (the new conservative channel) hot and heavy,” the sourcesaid.“It’s live, it’s real.” The new channel could come tofruitionwithin the next 10 to 12 months, the executive said.",1
"Mark Levin- conservative radio host and commentator, acknowledged his sheer disdain for the ex-top-rated entertainer of cable news – Bill O’Reilly, after he got fired because of accusations of sexual harassment, which was proclaimed on Wednesday.
“As those of you who are long time listeners to this program know, I was no fan of Bill O’Reilly. In fact … we despised each other,” Levin said.
“One of the reasons is because of this conduct in the past,” he added, referring to the sexual harassment history accusations against O’Reilly.
Levin considers that some of the accusations against O’Reilly may have been pointless, others were clearly not.
“Let me be quite clear about this as an attorney. There are allegations and then there are allegations. Some are more meritorious than others,” Levin said. “When people have actual tape recordings of you and you cut a deal, in part, to get the tape recordings back, that’s pretty bad. If somebody says you looked funny at them while they were sitting outside your office for several years, that’s pretty preposterous.”
Levin placed some of the responsibility concerning the persistent controversy surrounding O’Reilly on Fox News for the.
Saying “There’s enough there, a pattern with the guy that it’s quite obvious he has some issues.” “Now the point is, Fox News Channel, knowing at least most of this, re-upped him for $15 million to $20 million a year.”
Whereas not excusing O’Reilly behavior, Levin believes that members of the left made O’Reilly the target of coordinated efforts, because was much easier than pursuing allegations against their own.
“He became a target of the New York Times all of a sudden. He became a target of CNN. Media Matters went to work. Gabriel Sherman of New York Magazine went to work,” Levin prefaced.
“I’m certainly not going to defend Bill O’Reilly, but I will say this: The left works as a cabal,” Levin said. “They target people and they try to take them out. Not just somebody like O’Reilly, but they try to target good people sometimes and take them out.”
“I hearken back to the Bill Clinton years,” he said. “The New York Times, CNN, all the rest of them, were very dismissive of the allegations against Bill Clinton, including an allegation by Juanita Broaddrick of rape. I don’t think O’Reilly’s been accused of rape, has he?”
Although agreeing to settle with some of the women who accused him of sexual harassing them in the past, O’Reilly has categorically dismissed the allegations and released a statement Wednesday after Fox announced the termination of his contract.
“It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims. But that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today,” O’Reilly said.
The Fox News one of the original personalities O’Reilly, said he is satisfied with his accomplished at the network.
“I will always look back on my time at Fox with great pride in the unprecedented success we achieved and with my deepest gratitude to all my dedicated viewers. I wish only the best for Fox News Channel,” O’Reil.

"News 8 – Donald Trump has a double-digit lead over his next closest competitor in the race for the GOP presidential nomination, according to a Fox News poll. Trump takes 26% support in the poll, followed by Jeb Bush at 15%. When Fox asked the same question in July, Trump had only a small lead over Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. At the time, he took 18% support, compared to the 15% for Walker and 14% for Bush.
It’s the fourth pole in recent weeks to show Trump with a double-digit lead nationally. According to the Real Clear Politics average of polls on Monday, Trump leads the next closest contender, Bush, by 9.8 points. Walker is in third place in the Fox news poll, taking 9% support, followed by Ben Carson at 7% and Sen. Ted Cruz and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, each at 6%. Rounding out the top 10 are senators Mark Rubio, and Rand Paul at 6%, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio governor John Kasich, each at 3%.
Fox news is cappingthe first Republican presidential debate on Thursday at 10 candidates, based on national polling numbers. The media outlet hasn’t disclosed which polls it will use, but it seems likely Fox will use its own. That’s good news for Christie and Kasich, who have consistently finished in the top 10 in recent polls and appeared to be well positioned to nab the final two spots on the debate stage Thursday night.
Fox News is also hosting a forum earlier in the day for the candidates who don’t make the primetime debate cut.",1
"A spokesperson for Melanie Kohler, who has accused director Brett Ratner of raping her years ago, said today she will ""not be intimidated"" by the defamation lawsuit Ratner has filed in response to her allegation.
Ratner filed the suit in Hawaii federal court on Wednesday.
""The goal of these lawsuits is to intimidate women. Our goal is to stop the behavior. Melanie will not be intimidated,” Kohler's spokesperson Bill Burton told ABC News.
Her lawyer Robbie Kaplan added, ""We always knew that they would pick one woman to victimize further in an effort to bully other women into silence. Mr. Ratner and his lawyers can try to erase the truth through threats and intimidation, but courts decide cases based on the facts and the law. So our message to Mr. Ratner and his lawyer is short and simple: See you in court.""
Ratner's suit, filed by attorney Eric Seitz, is not tied to The Los Angeles Times report from earlier this week, where six women alleged that Ratner, 48, either sexually harassed or assaulted them. Kohler was not named in the article and she has since taken down her Facebook post where she claimed she was raped by the Hollywood director.
""This is an action for defamation arising from the defendant's deliberately false and malicious accusations that plaintiff raped the defendant 'about 12 years ago,'"" according to the suit, which was obtained by ABC News.
""Commencing on or about Oct. 20, 2017, defendant recklessly and/or intentionally posted a statement on her Facebook page claiming that 'Brett Ratner raped [her],"" the suit said.
Kohler said she had met the director at a Los Angeles club more than 12 years ago. She claimed Ratner took her to the home of fellow producer Robert Evans, where Ratner ""forced her"" to have sex, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages, noting that Ratner wants a ""jury trial"" to clear his name.
This legal development comes on the heels of The LA Times piece, where six actresses, including Olivia Munn and Natasha Henstridge, told the paper that Ratner was sexually inappropriate and/or abusive. Munn claims that as an aspiring actress she was forced to witness him pleasuring himself, while Henstridge claims he ""physically forced himself"" on her for oral sex.
In a statement to ABC News, Ratner's general counsel, Martin Singer, denied the allegations against his client.
""Brett Ratner vehemently denies the outrageous derogatory allegations that have been reported about him, and we are confident that his name will be cleared once the current media frenzy dies down and people can objectively evaluate the nature of these claims,"" Singer said in the statement. ""He understands the seriousness of this issue and the importance of addressing the concerns of victims of sexual misconduct both in the entertainment industry and beyond.""
While Warner Bros. now says it's reviewing the accusations against the filmmaker, putting on hold a long-in-development Hugh Hefner biopic Ratner was to produce and direct, Ratner released a statement to ABC News regarding his relationship with the studio, noting, ""I am choosing to personally step away from all Warner Bros.-related activities. I don’t want to have any possible negative impact to the studio until these personal issues are resolved.""",0

Barbara Laker, left, and Wendy Ruderman work on the “Toxic City” investigation in the combined Philadelphia newsroom. (Elizabeth Robertson )    The situation is sickeningly familiar to anyone who works on — or reads — a metropolitan daily newspaper, whether it’s in New Orleans, Detroit or just about any other American city. The paper is hurting financially. It cuts reporters, photographers and editors to make ends meet. Then it cuts even deeper. The journalism suffers, but the paper’s work is still vital to its community. And a question looms: Will it even survive the next decade? “The real crisis in American journalism is at the local and metro level,” says Jim Friedlich, executive director of the Lenfest Institute for Journalism in Philadelphia, founded last year to save local journalism in Philadelphia and spread the cure around the nation.  With the death of their old business model — based on once-plentiful print advertising — newsrooms are trying something new, he said. Like never before, they are turning to philanthropic sources and community support for sustenance. “We have to really face facts here — the commercial model isn’t going to fix the problem,” said Steven Waldman, who wrote a seminal FCC report in 2011 that laid out the burgeoning crisis. Since then, things may have improved for national news organizations, like The Washington Post and the New York Times, whose national and global journalism has attracted millions of digital subscribers. But on the local level, the crisis has only grown worse. Digital advertising, once thought to be a savior, hasn’t materialized sufficiently. The base of possible subscribers is limited. And vastly increased chain ownership by out-of-town investors, who too often squeeze the paper to improve profits, has wreaked havoc.  It’s not exaggerating to say that all kinds of local reporting — from day-to-day city hall coverage to world-changing investigations like the one celebrated in the movie “Spotlight” — is faced with extinction.  “People had to absorb the reality. There is now a recognition that the crisis in local journalism threatens our democracy and must be addressed,” said Waldman who along with Charles Sennott, a former Boston Globe Middle East bureau chief, heads one such new venture, Report for America.  With the ugly reality now all too obvious, hope-inspiring new efforts may be reaching critical mass. ●The Lenfest Institute, with $20 million in funding from Philadelphia businessman and philanthropist Gerry Lenfest, is focused on saving local journalism in Philadelphia, where the Inquirer and Daily News newsrooms, along with the digital Philly.com, pool their resources and innovations. And the institute is funding a wide array of start-ups and research projects from Cambridge, Mass. to Mountain View, Calif. ●ProPublica, the well-respected investigative nonprofit based in New York, has expanded to the Midwest, with a pilot project called ProPublica Illinois, striving to get local funding for its journalism. Similar branches could spring up around the country. ●The Texas Tribune, based in Austin, uses philanthropic dollars to staff its watchdog reporting efforts. (It emphasizes important state-government reporting, which has atrophied across the country.) The Tribune was an early — and visionary — example of the nonprofit model, along with MinnPost in Minnesota and Voice of San Diego. Some organizations are turning to a membership model that asks regular news consumers to get behind the journalism in their communities.   Report for America — funded partly by Google News Lab — has emerged as one of the most intriguing ideas. Modeled to some extent on the Peace Corps and Teach for America, it puts young journalists where they are most needed, for a year of service. In parts of Appalachia where reporting from metro dailies has withered, three Report for America journalists will work within traditional news organizations to supplement their coverage, said Sennott. The project wants 1,000 reporters placed within the next five years. “There’s a really great spirit of adventure in being a local reporter,” said Sennott, who founded the GroundTruth Project, a nonprofit which helps fund Report for America.  Can these efforts, worthy and well-intentioned as they are, really make up for having a strong newspaper (or, once upon a time, two or three) in every sizable American city? Certainly not. Or, more hopefully, not yet. But their growth is a sign that philanthropists, foundations and news consumers are taking the crisis seriously. Americans’ awareness of damaging hoaxes and lies in the form of news stories — also known as “fake news” — means that local news organizations are more important than ever.  “The public is paying attention,” said David Chavern, who heads the News Media Alliance, which rolls out a national public-education campaign this week called “Support Real News,” emphasizing the role of trusted — often local — news sources. “We have a moment,” he told me, “and moments don’t last.” To say that local journalism should be saved is an understatement. It simply must be saved, and the time is now. For more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan",0
"Bill O’Reilly Gets Non-Compete Clause Offer Worth Millions
Fox News has been struggling ever since they made the decision to fire Bill O’Reilly. They are completely clueless of what they are even doing right now and if they do not think of a solution soon, this could might as well mark the end of Fox News.
The network has been loosing viewers rapidly since the time Bill O’Reilly was fired. Just two weeks after, co-president Bill Shine has quit his job at the network. Sean Hannity might be the following to go as he often supported Shine throughout his time there.
Now it seems like Fox News has taken one more step in a stunning direction. They have allegedly offered Bill O’Reilly $20 million for a non-compete clause whose puprose is to keep O’Reilly from working for any other networ. This is a step that generally comes before the concerned person is fired, not weeks later. However it seems like O’Reilly could choose not to accept the deal as he is most likely not interested in this.
Fox News has damage the trust they had with Bill immensely. For that reason, it would be a surprise if Bill O’Reilly were to accept this money. He is in a better situation right now with the commence of his podcast on his website. There have also been rumors that a new conservative network is negotiations with Bill O’Reilly, Tomi Lahren and Sean Hannity. This network would be a massive thorn in Fox New’s eye.
Fox News has to act quickly and patch up the leakage of viewers and income they are looking at. It is improbable that people will keep on watching after all of these things have happened.",1
"ORLANDO F. L. (AP) — The FBI today released the final text message sent out by Omar Mateen to his wife just two hours after he started his attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando that  killed 49 people and injured 53 others. In the text, Mateen said, “I’m gay. I hate myself, and that’s why I’m doing this.”
The Muslim gunman who committed the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, was “100 percent” gay and bore a grudge against Latino men because he felt used by them, according to a man who says he was his lover for two months.
“I’ve cried like you have no idea. But the thing that makes me want to tell the truth is that he didn’t do it for terrorism. In my opinion he did it for revenge,” he told Univision Noticias anchor Maria Elena Salinas in an exclusive interview in English and Spanish on Tuesday.
He said Mateen was angry and upset after a man he had sex with later revealed he was infected with the HIV virus.
Asked why he decided to come forward with his story, he said: “It’s my responsibility as a citizen of the United States and a gay man.”
Seddique Mateen, Omar Mateen’s father claimed his son was seeking retribution against the gay community.
In a video posted on Facebook, Seddique Mateen said his 29-year-old son, Omar Mateen, shouldn’t have gone on the killing spree because ‘God himself will punish those involved in homosexuality’, according to a translation by the Washington Post.
In an earlier interview, he said there was no sign of any trouble when he saw his son just hours before the mass shooting, and he denied suggestions his son was radicalized or an ISIS sympathizer.
This text released today by the FBI comes as no surprise to those who study human behavior. A 1996 study, published in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, found a strong link between professed homophobia and homosexual arousal. “You can’t hate something so much without hating that about yourself, that’s Psychology 101”, said Dr. Paul Horner, professor of psychology at the University of Central Florida. “Mateen was raised as a Muslim by a father who was very much a homophobe himself. When you are raised to believe that your natural desires, desires which are beyond your own control, are sick and evil, it creates severe psychological problems that persist well into adulthood. There is really no telling how many more Omar Mateens are out there. Omar couldn’t be gay because of his religion. His actions and all the innocent lives he took had nothing to do with terrorism.”
The shooting has generated a mixed response among America’s conservatives, a group which is heavily influenced by Islam’s Abrahamic cousin, Christianity. Many Christians have spoken out against the shooting and say that it is a perfect example of why Islam is so dangerous and why its spread must be stopped. Many other Christians, such as Arizona Pastor Steven Anderson, have actually celebrated this attack, saying that this was a well-deserved punishment being visited upon the wicked by a righteous and vengeful God.
Dr. Cassandra Schmidt, professor of religious studies at the Central University of Northern Texas in Wichita Falls sees the development of a disturbing trend.
“Many people have bought into the notion recently that Christianity is somehow less dangerous than Islam because there are not as many acts of high-profile Christian terrorism, but this viewpoint ignores the fact that Christianity’s influence on Western civilization has been tempered by centuries of enlightenment thinking and scientific discoveries. Since the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, there has been a huge backlash against all things intellectual in this country, and in that time, Christianity has been moving very steadily in a much more fundamentalist direction. As the number of non-religious Americans continues to grow, I think you’re only going to see those who remain in the faith get more and more conservative and more and more detached from reality. At the rate things are going, I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see certain American Christians practicing female circumcision and honor killing within the next thirty years.”
Dr. Schmidt’s thoughts were echoed by a high ranking member of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles who describes himself as a “practicing homosexual”. For obvious reasons he agreed to speak with ABC news solely on a condition of anonymity. “The Muslim world behaves this way because they do not know any better; they do not have the advantage of being guaranteed a right to a secular education. Most Christians do, yet many are choosing to ignore what they have learned in favor of an ideology that, at its core, is almost indistinguishable from radical Islam. What most Americans do not realize is that there was a time long ago when the Muslim community was actually one of the world leaders in math, science, and technology and that during this time women in the Muslim world were actually treated far better than women in other religions throughout India and the Middle East were. Islam got to where it is today by turning its back on those enlightenment principles and embracing hardline religious doctrine in its place. It’s pretty obvious to even the most casual observer that this is where Christianity is headed.”
ABC news decided to take to the streets of Las Vegas to ask everyday Americans what they thought about Omar Mateen’s motivations for the attack. Most of the people who spoke with ABC news tended to agree that this was the act of a self-loathing homosexual and not that of an ISIS operative.
Allison Stewart, a rattlesnake farmer from Yucca, Arizona who was attending a trade show at the MGM Grand said that “I think it’s a load of [expletive] that people are trying to pin this whole thing on ISIS. The guy had nothing to do with ISIS. He loved [male genitalia] but he didn’t have the [male genitalia] to admit it. So he killed the part of himself he hated that he saw in those other people and blamed it on ISIS like a little [expletive].”
The Westboro Baptist Church, which is well known for its funeral protests and anti-gay activism, has already declared its intent to protest the Orlando victims’ funeral because of Mateen’s homosexuality. The organization routinely celebrates the deaths of homosexuals and others whom the church deems to be sinners or sodomites.
Shirley Phelps Roper offered her thoughts about Mateen to ABC news this morning via skype.
“I really wish that they would stop trying to tie this attack directly to ISIS. It is wrong to sully the name of such a wonderful organization by attaching this little [gay slur]’s name to it. Omar Mateen was a homosexual, and because he was raised in the ways of God’s righteous law, the weight of his sins ate away at his conscience until he snapped. God bless Islam, without it, this incident never would have happened. Westboro Baptist Church fully supports ISIS and its efforts to wipe homosexuals and infidels from the planet. We pledge our undying spiritual and financial support to them, with the hopes that they will inspire more conflicted homosexuals to follow Mateen’s lead. Just because you have homosexual desires doesn’t mean you should act on them. I’ve been attracted to women since I was 13, but I chose to turn that sickness over to the Lord. If you’re not willing to do that, you deserve what’s coming to you.”
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.
“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.” Mikkelson continues, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. We also sometimes like to say that there is some kind of top-secret, hidden website, underneath the site that we are debunking that actually has the malware, but we never say anything more than that, it’s all just for fun. And trust me, I think warning people about a website that could potentially destroy their computer is a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, I’d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.”
Regardless of how they feel about the issue, most Americans seem to be in agreement about why it happened. A young man had desires that were contrary to the religious beliefs he was raised with, and after years of internal conflict, he sought to cleanse himself and others through the Abrahamic faiths’ most ancient and revered practice: the spilling of blood. While most Americans agree on the whys, there is no consensus on how to fix the problem and prevent the next Omar Mateen.
For Leslie Duby-Sparks of the American Secular Society, the solution for the problem is rather simple.
“This incident shows without a doubt that we must eliminate religion from all aspects of society. Time and time again religion has been used to justify various atrocities. Slavery, segregation, and even the killing of African Americans by the police have been justified by Christians by quoting select portions of the Bible. Muslims and Christians need to be more like the Jews. Jews don’t kill anyone over their beliefs because most Jews have the sense to know their religion is nothing more than a fairytale. They follow their faith to preserve their unique cultural heritage, a heritage which has been pushed to the brink of extinction many times, usually by the Christians and the Muslims. They’re not so ridiculous as to think that a megalomaniac sky man actually sat down and wrote a book telling them not to touch themselves.”
If you or someone you know has had a homosexual relationship with Omar Mateen, the FBI has setup a Mateen Homosexual Hotline at (785) 273-0325. The FBI says that callers can remain anonymous.",1
"This is FRESH AIR. Our rock critic, Ken Tucker, is going to tell us about his list of the 10 best recordings of the year. But first, he's going to pay tribute to some of the musicians who died in 2016, starting with Leon Russell, who died in November.
LEON RUSSELL: (Singing) Whoa. How many days has it been since I was born? How many days till I die? Do I know any ways that I can make you laugh, or do I only know how to make you cry? When the baby looks around him...
KEN TUCKER, BYLINE: Any summation of the year in music for 2016 becomes a roll call for the dead. It seems as though there's been a startling increase in the number of important music makers who've passed away. Some of these deaths were shocks in various ways. We had no idea, for example, so soon after the release of his very good album ""Black Star"" that David Bowie would die.
When I reviewed Leonard Cohen's album of new songs, ""You Want It Darker,"" at the end of October, I said that its spiritually meditative music was like a living will. His age suggested that death might be imminent, but I couldn't know he'd die within days of the airing of that review.
The death of Prince seemed to momentarily shake the earth. How could a musician so vital, so present, so witty just vanish from daily existence?
PRINCE: (Singing) She saw me walking down the streets of your fine city. It kind of turned me on when she looked at me and said, come here. Now, I don't usually talk to strangers, but she looked so pretty. What can I lose if I just give her a little ear? What's up, little girl?
TUCKER: I know I'm not going to get to everyone, but other significant artists who died this year included Sharon Jones and Leon Russell, A Tribe Called Quest's Phife Dawg and the Eagles' Glenn Frey, Maurice White and Merle Haggard.
MERLE HAGGARD: (Singing) Down every road there's always one more city. I'm on the run, the highway is my home. I raised a lot of Cain back in my younger days, while Mama used to pray my crops would fail. Now I'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways - outrun the law or spend my life in jail. I'd like to settle down...
TUCKER: Turning to the living, I had no trouble coming up with 10 albums whose music provided me with reasons to be hopeful in a troubled year. There was amazing ambition on display from both Beyonce and Miranda Lambert. Beyonce's ""Lemonade"" wasn't just an album. It was a multimedia event full of power and assertiveness. Miranda Lambert filled the two dozen songs on ""The Weight Of These Wings"" with a passion that was often heartbreaking.
And speaking of heartache, it spilled over the edges of William Bell's remarkable comeback album, ""This Is Where I Live.""
WILLIAM BELL: (Singing) I was born in Memphis in a different world. Now that time has come and gone. I was just a little boy when I heard Sam Cooke singing a change is going to come. It touched my soul and let me know there's a promise of a brand new day. Then I left my home, started out on my own. This is where I live. This is where I live. This is where I give all my love, all my time, all my money, every dime. This is where I live.
TUCKER: I put two debut albums on my year-end top 10. The first is Margaret Glaspy's deceptively direct ""Emotions And Math."" The second is by The I Don't Cares, which is really a new act from two familiar voices - Paul Westerberg and Juliana Hatfield. For the life of me, I cannot figure out why their slashing yet playful album ""Wild Stab"" didn't make more of a splash.
THE I DON'T CARES: (Singing) When the loneliest eyes and the emptiest arms finally decided to meet with a head in a lap and a tongue tied in knots, then the loneliest eyes try and speak. You were born for me.
TUCKER: Kelsey Waldon's hardcore country album ""I've Got A Way"" was a model of throwback music that avoided nostalgia. I admired greatly the gritty yet alluring rhythm and blues of Maxwell's ""BlackSUMMERS'night"" and the hard-charging ambition of Car Seat Headrest's ""Teens Of Denial.""
CAR SEAT HEADREST: (Singing) I'm so sick of fill in the blank. Accomplish more, accomplish nothing. If I were split in two, I would just take my fists so I can beat up the rest of me. You have no right to be depressed. You haven't tried hard enough...
TUCKER: Finally, two long-time favorites made my year-end list. Robbie Fulks' ""Upland Stories"" was a frequently magnificent achievement full of novelistically (ph) detailed compositions about how the world can let you down. And Bonnie Raitt's ""Dig In Deep"" did just what its title said. It bore down hard on the idea that people frequently try to be better than they are and come up short.
All in all, it was a sad year for music and an exhilarating one. New avenues of expression opened up for musicians just starting out, while some of the best veterans made being in it for the long haul sound like the most rewarding journey imaginable.
GROSS: Ken Tucker is critic-at-large for Yahoo TV. If you'd like to catch up on FRESH AIR interviews you missed, like my interviews with Billy Eichner, Fox News host Megyn Kelly or New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet, or Dave Davies' interview about fake news, check out our podcast, where you'll find plenty of FRESH AIR interviews.
FRESH AIR's executive producer is Danny Miller. Our interviews and reviews are produced and edited by Amy Salit, Phyllis Myers, Ann Marie Baldonado, Sam Briger, Lauren Krenzel, John Sheehan, Heidi Saman, Therese Madden and Mooj Zadie. I'm Terry Gross.
BONNIE RAITT: (Singing) It's hard to say now who left first. It used to seem so clear. You and I were tangled from the start. Somehow, the scales just fell away. Now I'm left standing here, blown open in the hole that was my part. I wrap the dark around me. There's no solace here tonight, just wishing in regret for company. My glass is raised for all the ways we tried to get it right, and I'm sorry for the ones we couldn't be. I'm so sorry for the ones we couldn't be. Looking through these photographs, searching for a clue, how you and I got tangled from the start. Not even...

It is one of the hardest places in the world to tweet from but there is a network of experts covering everything from culture to politics. Here’s our pick to get you started
North Korea is probably one of the hardest places on the planet to tweet from. The web is severely restricted, with access to computers and mobiles phone available to an elite few. Most North Koreans only have access to a state controlled intranet, called Kwangmyong, or bright.
The country does have its own twitter account @uriminzok (english translation available @uriminzok_engl), launched in 2010 declaring ""The Web site 'Our Nation' is on Twitter"". At the time of writing the account follows three others: Vietnam, a Pyongyang propaganda site and Jimmy Dushku, a 25-year-old web developer and tycoon from Texas who is as confused as the rest of us as to why.
In 2013 they opened up a 3G network, but only for foreign tourists. Associated Press journalist Jean H Lee (@newsjean) was the first person to Tweet and Instagram from it, closely followed by Dennis Rodman. Lee described the experience as liberating, moving on from the days where she had to leave her phone at the airport.
Journalists are still incredibly restricted as to what they can depict. David Guttenfelder, a photographer for Associated Press who, like Lee, enjoys more access than most, has to ask permission in writing everywhere he goes: ""There are some very difficult discussions after the pictures are published - we often lock horns because they have a very different idea of how North Korea should be covered,"" he says.
Guttenfelder, who won a Time award for his Instagram coverage, believes the secret to covering North Korea is in the mundane detail, ""the piece off the puzzle that when you put them all together reveal something about the place"".
Despite the challenge from inside the country, there is a network of expert North Korea watchers tweeting about everything from culture to politics. Start by following @GuardianNK for the latest from our network, as well as our North Korea partners on Twitter. And here's our pick of the rest to get you started, also available as a Twitter list.

"In the wake of the Roy Moore fiasco, a number of “hot takes” have made their rounds in the media. How obviously hypocritical it is, for example, for evangelical leaders to stand behind a man credibly accused of sexually assaulting a minor. The dim-witted tribalism of people like Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, who all but said she’d elect Jack the Ripper to the Senate as long as he pledged to overturn Roe v. Wade. How Donald Trump could spend most of the 2016 campaign and beyond reveling in accusations against Bill Clinton—that Clinton of course denies—while taking Moore’s own denials at their word. And more to the point, how the president, accused of sexual misconduct by far more women than Senator Al Franken has been, still couldn’t resist taunting Franken from his (undoubtedly gold-tinged) glass house.
All of these are deserving of comment, to be sure. But there is one hot take that the media seems to be missing—the one about the role it has played in creating this sad, sordid, sickening mess in the first place.
How have we reached a point in this country when nearly half the voters of a U. S. state so mistrust, and even revile, major media outlets that they are willing to brush aside credible evidence and elect an accused sexual predator simply out of spite? How have we reached a point where a president of the United States can just declare “fake” news he doesn’t like—and largely get away with it?
In at least one survey, trust in the media—the necessary vanguard of any free society—is even lower than trust in Trump, which itself is nothing to tweet about. How on earth has this happened?
It is easy, of course, to blame Trump himself—and his shrewd if unseemly campaign to delegitimize any and all media outlets that criticize him. It’s also easy to dismiss a certain segment of voters as simply being—er, deplorable. But that’s not the reason we are here—in an era where some 50 people can credibly report sexual misconduct allegations about a Senate candidate to a major newspaper and yet that candidate still has a chance to win. This despite the fact that the allegations are coming from the very same newspaper whose credible reporting once helped bring down a Republican president.
No, the real reason for a situation that allows the Roy Moores and Donald Trumps of the world to rise above mere laughingstock status is that the media has totally lost its connection with a large portion of the nation, almost all of them conservatives. Worse, the media has become what Trump and allies refer to as “the opposition party”—and, as such, a most useful foil for the Trump administration.
This problem is real. The anger against the mainstream media is deep-seated. And, as difficult as it is for many to accept, much of the anger is justified.
For many years, while Trump was still choosing fake apprentices on a TV show and Moore was still wandering in front of Hot Topic and Forever 21 at the local mall, the media—and by that I mean the major networks, most major newspapers and cable news programs outside of Fox—has displayed a vexing double standard against conservatives. Those in the media unwilling to even see that as a possibility—and I’m sure there are many—are hopelessly lost to their own biases.
Remember all of the hostile press conferences and exchanges that Washington reporters routinely had with the Obama White House, or when Obama’s daily utterances were challenged every day on CNN? Conservatives don’t. Although Obama veterans surely see it differently, the press corps offered largely favorable coverage of the Obama years—at least when compared to Republican administrations. Plenty of surveys bear that out. Such as this one. And this one. And articles such as this one. And this one—this one, too. Conservatives do remember, however, the endless attacks on Reagan’s mental abilities, on George H. W. Bush’s alleged out-of-touch elitism, and on his son’s various verbal miscues and alleged racial insensitivity.
And then there’s the media’s constant and well known distrust of Republican motives. While the bungled rollout of Obamacare, and its website glitches, did get its fair share of negative coverage back in the day, few if any prominent mainstream journalists ever doubted the president’s intentions or his commitment to helping improve the lives of his fellow Americans. Can the same be said of coverage of Reagan’s welfare reform program or George W. Bush’s effort to respond to Hurricane Katrina or the Republican Congress’ current tax cut plan? Conservatives certainly don’t think so.
Were there long, online trackers of Obama’s every “lie” or misstatement as there are of the current Republican president’s? Of course not. Trump is unarguably a special case when it comes to bending the truth, but all presidents stretch the truth from time to time—Obama included. As CNN’s own Jake Tapper recently noted, “President Obama said things that weren’t true and got away with it more for a variety of reasons, and one is the media was much more supportive of him.” I’m not by any means a defender of Trump, but it’s hard to argue the media is attempting to offer any semblance of balance in the light of studies, such as Harvard’s, that showed 93 percent of Trump’s media coverage has been negative.
Trump supporters—as well as conservatives who might not otherwise be inclined to support Trump—have noticed. And it means that today, many on the right simply have no use for the mainstream media. Fox News would have no purpose, no reason for being, if more conservatives felt that their views were getting a “fair and balanced” perspective on the major networks. Indeed, one year ago nearly half the nation elected as a president a man whose most important qualification for high office seemed to be that the media hated him.
What can be done to change this sentiment?
Plenty, of course. And it’s pretty obvious stuff.
For one, networks could end the customary two- or three- or four- on one panels discussing the news of the day where people like former Reagan aide Jeffrey Lord and/or some other person no one has ever heard of are the lone defenders of the “conservative view” against a slew of heavy-hitting liberals. For another, news organizations seeking to report on the issues affecting the entire nation in an unbiased fashion might want to hire more reporters who haven’t spent much of their lives in the Acela corridor, where the last Republican they voted for was Michael Bloomberg. (Hint for recruiters: If everyone you interview knows immediately what the Acela corridor is, keep looking.)
Of course the first step is for the heads of the major media outlets to actually care about the problem. Despite a few half-hearted efforts during the aftershocks of 2016 election to try to better understand the Trump voters that many reporters didn’t know even existed, it’s not clear that most really do care. There’s very little incentive in today’s tribal climate to try to offer a more balanced picture on various issues or to hear out the other side—to have a frame of mind that accepts that maybe tax cuts can help spur job growth, or maybe the Obama administration did make some mistakes, or maybe every single thing Trump does and says isn’t by definition an outrage requiring days of focus and attention, or maybe federal regulations have in some cases gone too far, or maybe there are other smart, well-meaning Republicans who aren’t Susan Collins or Lindsey Graham.
But the unwillingness to address this problem now could well lead to a second Trump administration—and all of the horrors that might be unleashed on the world as a result. And a reluctant-to-change media will be as much to blame for that anyone else.",0
"CNN, rightly referred to as the Communist News Network, used to tout itself as the “world’s leader in news.” As of late, it’s become known as the world’s leader of FAKE news.
CNN decried all the “fake news outlets” such as Breitbart and smaller, independent news networks, like this one, as being “fake news outlets” because we ran the stories that they would not, only to show the other side of the story, which just so happened to be, in most cases, the real side of the story.
Businesses and agencies around the country have been banning CNN from their television sets since CNN began getting busted near daily for fake news reports, such as the false dossier on Trump report, and most recently, the claim that President Trump removed the bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. In that lie, CNN went as far as sharing a picture of where the bust actually was, but with a reporter standing in front of it so that it could not be seen.
Do they really think we’re that stupid?
Media outlet Western Journalism is reporting today thatValparaiso YMCA CEO Robert Wanek, of the Valparaiso, Indiana YMCA is only the latest businessman in America to ban CNN from their televisions. Wanek says the move comes in an attempt to “remove perceived political bias,” and we don’t think he was talking about it being perceived as if the YMCA was biased, but rather that he was protecting his patrons from CNN’s political bias.

"Social media is claiming to know the identity of the person who drove the car into a crowd of protesters today in Charlottesville, Virginia. If true, the identity is a startling revelation: the suspect is an ANTIFA supporter who may have believed he was running over Trump supporters.
We must stress that this information is unconfirmed. Please do not take this as fact until more sources are available.
The person responsible for the car attack appears to be Joel Vangheluwe. This image appeared online appearing to link the car’s registration to his father.
In Joel’s social media, it is clear his father bought him the car. His social media also makes it clear he hates Donald Trump. Reports say the driver was drunk or stoned, so it appears he may have run over the wrong intended target.
Here is the registration information.
GotNews.com broke the story. Here is their information.
Evidence indicates a left-winger mowed down antifa counter-protestors in Charlottesville, not a right-winger or white nationalist, GotNews can exclusively reveal.
License plate searches of the 2010 Dodge Challenger that killed one and injured nearly 20 in Charlottesville found that the vehicle was registered to a Jerome Vangheluwe of Michigan.
A Facebook crawl of his relatives reveals the car was in the possession of his son, Joel.

"Mandalay Bay Hotel Security Guard Jesus Campos made headlines for reportedly being the first individual to encounter Las Vegas shooting suspect, Stephen Paddock. He has now made his first—and, according to Ellen, his only—public appearance on the Ellen Show.
Campos’ testimony is notable because he was reportedly Paddock’s first victim, sustaining a gunshot wound to the leg as police claim Paddock fired 200 rounds into the hallway of the 32nd floor.
However, Campos’ first interview has only generated more questions as to what actually happened during the massacre, and why crucial aspects of the narrative continue to change. Here are 5 glaring questions from the interview:
1. Campos chose to go onThe Ellen Degeneres Showafter canceling his appearance on Fox News and other dedicated news channels. Why?
2. The security guard, who presented himself onEllenwith a walking cane, was holding it incorrectly (selectively edited out of the aboveclip).Did no one teach him how to hold it?
3. Ellen never asked him about which leg was shot or his recovery time. She seemed to not be too interested in his injuries. But she quickly took over the interview and some would say, led Campos, even telling the story better than he did, as if she knew more than he did. She even broke out blueprints of the 32nd floor of the hotel, and with a pointer, guided Campos through his narration.
4. We now know there was another person in the hallway that night, a woman, whom Campos said he told to go back into her room. Who is she, what did she see and hear, and can we at least have her, too, make an odd appearance onEllen?
5. Does anyone else find it odd that Ellen spoke directly for Campos and told the world he would not be granting another interview ever?
That last question is probably the strangest of all. Ellen, without any prodding from Campos, began speaking, arguably for Campos, and told the world:
“You’ve had so many people asking for you to tell the story and to talk about this and I understand your reluctance because you just want this to be overso you’re talking about it now and then you’re not gonna talk about it againand I don’t blame you because why relive this over and over again but it’s helpful for people to understand what a hero you are…”
Why would Ellen take it upon herself to speak on Campos’ behalf? Was that one of the conditions Campos placed on Ellen was that she had to speak for him and tell the world to stop asking for interviews because he isn’t going to give any more?
Where are all of the questions that arguably should have been asked, such as:
* How long did the police speak with you?
* Did you see anyone else going in and out of the room or even in that hallway?
* How long did it take police to arrive on the floor?
* In your opinion, as a security guard, could more have been done to penetrate that room sooner?
* Do you think it is a miracle that you were shot at 200 times and only hit once?
The fact that none of these questions were asked of Campos has led to even more seasoned members of the news media questioning the absurdity of it all. Fox News’ Tucker Carlson told Geraldo Rivera he believes the lack of transparency on the part of Las Vegas Police has led to the explosion of conspiracy theories about the shooting.
Carlson, earlier in the week, called Campos’ no-show appearance on FNC’s Hannity and his disappearance as“very odd.”HetoldRivera he believed the authorities involved were“hiding something.”
Then on Wednesday, after Campos’ Ellen appearance, Carlsonsaidthe Vegas shooting“has actually gotten weirder.”Carlson questioned the whole segment and asked,“Was that really an interview?” The FNC anchor openly questioned whether or not the decision to have Campos be interviewed by Degeneres was a cross-marketing opportunity by MGM Grand, since Mandalay Bay is owned by MGM and Ellen is sponsored by them as well.
Carlson conceded the lack of transparency by the FBI and the LVMPD, and now Campos’ appearance on Ellen has encouraged the public to come up with conspiracy theories about the shooting. And until the FBI and the LVMPD provide the public with crime scene photos and surveillance footage, the truth of what happened in Vegas may never fully be known.",1

"""How should a Nobel laureate dress?"" asked Kazuo Ishiguro, who, 40 minutes earlier, had found out he had won the Nobel Prize for Literature.
To say the news was unexpected is an understatement. He literally couldn't believe it.
Until, that was, his phone began to ring constantly, an orderly queue of TV crews started to form outside his front door (""how do they all know where I live?""), and his publishers dispatched a top team to his house as back-up.
This was not fake news. This was delightful, surprising news. Maybe there were others who should have won instead, he wondered. ""But that is the nature of prizes. They are a lottery.""
While chaos reigned around him, he was calm, assured and thoughtful, talking (after nipping upstairs to fetch a smart jacket for our interview) about his belief in the power of stories and how those that he wrote would often explore wasted lives and opportunities.
""I've always had a faith that it should be possible, if you tell stories in a certain way, to transcend barriers of race, class and ethnicity.""
For me, he is one of the great living writers working in any language. All writers can tell stories. Ishiguro tells stories on another level.
He places the reader in some sort of alternative reality - which might be the future, it might be the present, it might be the past. They feel like places that are whole and real, but you don't know them.
They're weird and not necessarily happy places. But they're places that you can inhabit and relate to, and you become deeply involved with the characters. That's the writer's job - he just does it better than most.
Growing up in England in a Japanese household was crucial to his writing, he says, enabling him to see things from a different perspective to many of his British peers.
It is most obvious in the slightly detached nature of many of his narrators, which he explains as coming from ""a long tradition in Japanese art towards a surface calm and surface restraint. There is a felling emotions can feel more intense if they are held down to the surface level"".
There was nothing superficial about his emotions when we met earlier today. He was chuffed to bits, and rightly so.
Kazuo Ishiguro is worthy recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

"International fashion house Gucci has been sending its iconic stripes down the runway for more than half a century in blue-red-blue and green-red-green.
But they're not alone, reports CBS News' Dana Jacobson. Similar designs with similar stripes are being sold by Forever 21. Now Gucci is suing the fast-fashion retailer for trademark infringement.
""Gucci is really having a moment and driving a lot of sales with these stripes,"" said Susan Scafidi, director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University.
""How can you actually trademark stripes?"" Jacobson asked.
""When consumers recognize a certain striped pattern, whether it's Gucci's green, red, green, or Adidas' three-striped mark, then we give those companies recognition that those marks belong to those companies,"" Scafidi said.
Sometimes imitation isn't the sincerest form of flattery, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. In June, Forever 21 pre-emptively sued Gucci to protect itself.
""Isn't it good for Gucci if there are more people wearing a jacket that I might think is a Gucci jacket?"" Jacobson asked.
""Oh no. Gucci's brand value gets diluted,"" Scafidi said. ""Items like this hurt the bottom line because there's market substitution, people trade down or fail to buy the original.""
Scafidi said Gucci has laid out a strong case.
""This is Gucci's counterclaim in two pictures. Forever 21 is focused on the stripes and claimed that they used blue-red-blue stripes randomly. Gucci would like the court to look at this and say, 'Oh no. That wasn't random. You're copying the entire Gucci product and attempting to convince the consumer to think about Gucci when it's really just Forever 21,'"" Scafidi explained.
""It looks like the exact same jacket,"" Jacobson said.
""It really does very much look like a line-for-line, stitch-for-stitch copy,"" Scafidi said.
Women's Wear Daily style director Alex Badia said, ""It is very interesting what fast retailers are doing because they bring in those trends to the masses.""
""Everybody does it one way or another. Everybody gets inspired by other people. At times a little bit of copying is good. But there is a way of doing it in which you don't cross the line,"" Badia said.
In a statement to CBS News, Forever 21 called Gucci's claim false and said ""clothes with this same, common stripe design have been sold for many years, by many different brands and remain widely available today.""
""Forever 21 would love to cancel the Gucci trademarks in those stripes and free itself to copy those Gucci stripes over and over again. But Forever 21 may also seek to simply establish itself as a tough customer to sue,"" Scafidi said.
In a statement to CBS News, Gucci said with this lawsuit it has taken the step to ""finally put an end"" to Forever 21's ""blatant exploitation"" of its famous trademarks. Gucci is not the first to sue Forever 21. Adidas and Puma also brought similar suits against the company earlier this year.",0
"After nearly a century of building vehicles powered by fossil fuels, General Motors — one of the world’s largest automakers — announced Monday that the end of GM producing internal combustion engines is fast approaching.
The acceleration to an all-electric future will begin almost immediately, with GM releasing two new electric models next year and anadditional 18 by 2023.
At a media event at GM’s technical campus in Warren, Mich., on Monday, Mark Reuss, the company’s chief of global product development, said the transition will take time, but the course has been set.
“General Motors believes in an all-electric future,” Reuss said. “Although that future won’t happen overnight, GM is committed to driving increased usage and acceptance of electric vehicles.”
Reuss avoided naming the yearwhen the auto giant will cease producing gas and diesel vehicles, noting that the company is too large to make such an estimate, according to USA Today.
GM finished 2016 as the world’s third-largest auto-seller, breaking previous company records with 10 million vehicles sold, the company said in a news release.
The automaker said that arriving at a “zero emissions future” will require a two-pronged approach: battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles.
At Monday’s event, Fast Company reported, officials unveiled three concepts for reporters: “a sporty crossover, a larger wagon or SUV and a tall, boxy pod car that looked like a people-mover for cities.”
[Tesla’s Model 3 has ‘mass appeal.’ That doesn’t mean you can afford it.]
GM also introduced a fuel-cell-powered heavy-duty truck with two electric motors known as Surus,or “silent utility rover universal superstructure.”
GM’s foray into the electric marketplace has already resulted in resounding success, with theChevrolet Bolt being namedMotor Trend’s 2017 Car of the Yearand the2017 North American Car of the Year.The Bolt boasts a 240-mile battery range on a single charge andcosts $37,500 before tax incentives. That range places the vehicle well above the Nissan Leaf (up to 107 miles on a single charge) and slightly above Tesla’s Model 3 (up to 220 miles on a single charge for a standard battery).
As GM commits to electric innovation, the company will competein an increasingly crowded marketplace. In recent months, Tesla unveiled the company’s first mass market electric vehicle, joining companiessuch as Ford, Volvo, Nissan, Aston Martin and Jaguar Land Rover, all of whom are vying for market space.
[Volvo says it will abandon traditional engines by 2019]
On Monday, Ford announced plans to create a group known as “Team Edison” that is to be tasked with developing fully electric cars. Sherif Marakby, Ford’s head of electrification and autonomous vehicles,told Automotive News that the company is on pace to produce13 electrified vehiclesover the next five years.
“We see an inflection point in the major markets toward battery electric vehicles,” Marakby said. “We feel it’s important to have a cross-functional team all the way from defining the strategy plans and implementation to advanced marketing.”

"SACRAMENTO, CA –-(Ammoland.com)- Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) has issued the following statement concerning demands for new gun control following the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas:
We are deeply saddened by the loss of life and grieve for all those affected by the hand of an evil man in Sutherland Springs, Texas; indeed, we mourn for every man, woman, and child lost to unjust violence and unconscionable circumstance wherever and however they may fall.
In the aftermath of the horrific and illegal premeditated killing at the First Baptist Church we see once more, and quite clearly, that only virtuous people bearing arms can effectively respond to those evil or insane people who, devoid of a moral core, take deliberate actions to kill and injure others when they are at their most vulnerable. And, too, such virtuous people are not limited to those in government service; rather, they are found in abundance throughout our great nation, standing as sheepdogs, vigilant for the cause of peace but prepared to defend life if needed, perhaps even at the cost of their own.
In response to tragedy, some predatory politicians and others like them in the billionaire-backed gun control lobby have demanded, disingenuously, that those who advocate for individual freedoms must participate in some “conversation,” as if they are empowered to unilaterally compel their fellow citizens to do as they wish. But as the observant among us know all too well, their latent—and sometimes patent—desire is for no more dialogue to be had at all, simply that the Second Amendment’s core guarantees against government infringement be reduced unto a dead letter.
We believe the only “conversation” that is genuinely pertinent to their efforts is set forth in Article V of the U. S. Constitution, which provides the process for lawfully changing the supreme document of our social contract. All other proposals turn on legislation wrought from the tyranny of the majority; administrative rules and regulations to expand their preferred bureaucracy; and lawless rule by now-fashionable ‘pen-and-phone’ executive fiat. As a reminder to all who promote such dangerous instruments to achieve their gun control goals: Any rule crafted to impinge on Second Amendment rights can just as easily be reframed to limit the rights you hold dear; any offense you might employ against individual freedom today will, at some point, become someone else’s incursion on another liberty tomorrow.
If gun control proponents were honest—and they are by no means honest—they would admit what they really want when they demand a dialogue: for freedom advocacy organizations like FPC, and our law-abiding supporters, to concede ground to them on their terms, and with no reciprocation, so that they may more easily red-line fundamental, individual constitutional rights they do not like. We refuse to participate in their squalid process. We have no moral obligation to aid and abet our opposition, whether physical or philosophical, and we will not do so here.
Law-abiding gun owners are not responsible for evil or insane killers who use firearms, just as peaceable Muslims are not responsible for radical Islamic terrorists flying planes into our buildings and killing thousands, slaying hundreds in bomb blasts, or even running over dozens with vehicles. As we have said before, we reject the notion that good people and our basic rights must suffer for the crimes of the wicked.
We know that modern theories of gun control rely on the existence of three essential components to achieve, through force and attrition, the ultimate goal of a disarmed society: registration of people and property in persistent databases (through background checks and sale or transfer records); ever-expanding categories of prohibited people and items; and responsive confiscation of arms through law enforcement efforts. See, for example, California’s firearm regulatory scheme and associated APPS confiscation program or the New York SAFE Act.
In the final analysis, all roads lead to confiscatory laws with criminal consequences. And those who advocate for gun control would see other peoples’ sons and daughters carry the personal risk of their unchained desire to re-create America into the authoritarian utopia they seek.
To be sure, all constitutional rights have social costs, and the Second Amendment is not unique from other fundamental rights in that respect. But those considerations were weighed and the social interests balanced when we ratified the Bill of Rights in 1791 and, perhaps more importantly, upon re-affirming our commitment to those principles for all people in 1868 when we enshrined the Fourteenth Amendment and ensured their application to states and local governments.
Because of inalienable human rights like the individual right to keep and bear arms, protected by the Second Amendment, the news media is free to report on uncomfortable or embarrassing matters of national security; editorialists are free to discuss, even encourage, the removal of a sitting president; and those who promote gun control, even in opposition to the ruling party, have the freedom to advocate for those views.
The right to keep and bear arms, like freedom of speech and the right to due process, is a bright line rule that separates the people from servitude. Our nation’s founders wisely took great pains to protect fundamental rights like those contained in the First and Second Amendments in the very textual threads of our social fabric—not because they are benign, but because they are inherently dangerous and necessary to an enduring free Republic.
We recognize that gun control is one growing front of a still-cold but increasingly bitter war between those who desire a powerful government that has the ability to control its people and those who value freedom and individual liberty. But an armed and prepared citizenry—indeed, the unorganized militia—is the first, and perhaps last, line of defense against the deranged, evil, and tyrannical.
Accordingly, FPC believes that Congress should immediately work to remedy or repeal previously-enacted unconstitutional laws and expand statutory protections for those who would safely and responsibly exercise their right to keep and bear arms inside and outside their homes. Dozens of such bills exist today, and they should be passed and signed into law without further delay.
Firearms Policy Coalition (www.firearmspolicy.org) is a 501(c)4 grassroots nonprofit organization. FPC’s mission is to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, especially the fundamental, individual Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

"The geopolitical sphere of our world has been undergoing dramatic changes on every front for the past several years. In the past 2 years alone specifically, we’ve seen alliances broken, alliance made and the propaganda intensify. Reading any mainstream media reports over that time has shown us a different picture of what has really been taking place.
Even most alternative media outlets are not aware of what is happening and are still bent on the belief that the “Powers That Were” or NWO arealwaysgoing to retain it’s perception of power. Reality, however, has been setting in and has taken much more solid form over the past year. A whistle-blower that has been speaking of this massive geopolitical, financial and social change is named Benjamin Fulford.
Benjamin is a professional writer and journalist who was Forbes Magazine Asia-Pacific Bureau Chief from 1998-2005. Ben has writtenextensively on the real reason behind 9/11, U. S. media manipulation and government and financial corruption. Benquit his Forbes position“in profound disgust over extensive corporate censorship and mingling of advertising and editorial at the magazine.”
He has also written that his “goal is to counter U. S. propaganda and expose the Japanese people to the truth so that they may free themselves from the colonial yoke and use their $5 trillion in overseas holdings to end world poverty and save the environment.”
For nearly four years I have followed Ben’s posts and watched as the geopolitical landscape has evolved. For me and others who have followed his writings, we have seen much of what he and his sources have been saying coming true. The list is quite extensive, but for time’s sake I will list three major events that were reported in advance of actually occurring.
The first is the Netherland’s Queen Beatrix abdicating her throne back in 2013. Queen Beatrix was well known as a member of the Bilderberg Group and Committee of 300. The second is the BRICS Alliance taking form with actual banking institutions.
The BRICS created their bank in July of 2015 and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was announced with 57 founding member nations in June of 2015. These are publicly being described as direct rivals to the West-manipulated IMF and World Bank. Third, it was reported a few weeks ago that certain factions within BRICS/White Dragon Society Alliance were in negotiations with the British to buy a major newspaper. Then on July 23rd, 2015 it was reported worldwide that Financial Times was bought by Nikkei, a Japanese Company.
According to Fulford’s MI5 sources, the Rothschild family sold off their stake in the company“as a way of cashing out before having their media control confiscated by anti-trust action.”It now seems we are finally going to start getting some real and undistorted financial news from a major media outlet.
Some of Fulford’s sources include high-level agents of KGB, MI5, MI6, CIA, Mossad, Vatican P2 Lodge, the Chinese government, Japanese military intelligence and the Pentagon, which is now clearly aligned with the BRICS Alliance and is making moves to legally and financially take down the banking cabal. In my last article,25 Signs That The Global Elite’s Ship Is About To Sink, I discuss further certain moves the BRICS and Pentagon alliance have taken tobring financial, political and social justice to our world.
Though not everything Fulford has written over the past months has resonated with me, I can say that much of what he and his sources report do resonate and are being reflected in the real world. Their information has remained consistent and many things have come to pass. I highly recommend reading his last three articleshere,hereandhere.
Lastly, I will also recommend looking intoNeil Keenan. He and his team are working to open theGlobal Collateral Accounts, which have strong ties to9/11, the JFK assassination and the Bretton Woods Agreement.
This movement is in conjunction with theBRICS movement, which is to free our world of illegal financial and political activities by arresting certain politicians and bankers and returning to true freedom to every nation on this world. Don’t think such a coordinated move is possible between U. S. Marshals, The Pentagon, Interpol, Europol, Russian, Chinese and Japanese military intelligence agencies? Well, you’re going to soon see it with you own eyes.",1

"With help from Nancy Scola, Margaret Harding McGill, John Hendel and Steven Overly
JUST IN: SINCLAIR HITS BACK - The broadcaster defended its $3.9 billion deal with Tribune Media to the FCC, arguing that growing larger is necessary for broadcasters to survive. Sinclair, which filed its formal response to petitions to deny the deal late last night, fought back against critics who say the merger will harm local news and will allow Sinclair to demand higher retransmission fees. Sinclair said providing national news stories to local stations frees up the stations to focus more on local news and that the arguments about retransmission consent are “self-serving and unsupported.” “Each of the petitioners is either trying to use this proceeding to stifle competition for its own economic interests or is still living in a pre-cable, pre-internet, presmartphone world, untethered from the economic realities of the current media market,” Sinclair told the agency.
FINAL TAKEAWAYS FROM TECHNOLOGY POLICY INSTITUTE’S ANNUAL ASPEN FORUM — Tuesday was the second and final day of TPI’s policy gathering in the mountains of Colorado, and Nancy mined a handful of nuggets from the proceedings.
Is it time to consider the cost of closing the digital divide? Mark Jamison, who helped lead the Trump administration transition at the FCC, argued on a panel that “we’ve failed to do any kind of cost-benefit analysis” on government efforts to get more Americans online. “If we're talking about taking money from one place and putting it to broadband that people are unwilling to pay for, then we get less housing, we get less food, we get less education -- something else is given up,"" said Jamison, the director of the University of Florida’s Public Utility Research Center. ""We've never asked the question: is it worth it or not?"" (ICYMI: FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has an office in the works to answer exactly that sort of query, expected to launch by early 2018.)
FCC Commissioner Michael O’Reilly and Google’s Will Hudson discussed the U. S. role in the global internet policy. Both said they worry about other governments trying to gain control of the internet’s operations via country-to-country bodies. But they differed on how to counter the trend. O’Rielly held that the U.S. should engage in groups like the International Telecommunication Union, and do it from a place of strength. “We must change our approach or involvement as it currently stands because I don't think we're taking advantage of our rightful role given our contributions,” he said, regarding the country’s traditional leadership role in shaping how the internet works and the dominance of the U.S. tech industry. Hudson, for his part, said the ITU should remain a place where only technical decisions are made. When it comes to treating that United Nations-affiliated forum as a policymaking body, “in our view, not only are these efforts wrong and counterproductive, they detract from the important work these institutions are doing.""
Regarding U. S. tech policy leadership, one European said it’s a tricky example to follow. Wolfgang Kopf, Deutsche Telekom’s senior vice president for public and regulatory affairs, was asked whether Europe is taking guidance from, say, the FCC’s moves on net neutrality. Said Kopf, “What always happens in Europe is that the regulatory ideas [in the United States] sound good"" and so Europeans adopt them, but then “the U.S. moves forward and abandons this stuff, and we are regulated"" -- that is, stuck in semi-permanent form with ideas that are still works-in-progress back in the States. (To which the FCC’s O’Rielly responded, with a laugh but also in seriousness, “I’m so sorry.”)
Newseum President and CEO Jeffrey Herbst is no fan of the News Media Alliance’s push for an antitrust exemption to confront Google and Facebook’s effect on news distribution. Herbst laid out his position in an on-stage interview, and in a later airport chat, Nancy got more of his thinking. For one thing, Herbst said, getting Congress to go along right now would be enormously politically difficult. But more than that, he said, lots of slices of American life are struggling to deal with the Silicon Valley pair’s disruption, and so “if there’s an antitrust issue, there should be an antitrust action, rather than a sectoral exemption.” But Herbst also took a step back. “The real issue is product,” he said. “Is the media developing a product which people actually want to buy, and therefore will attract advertising? I don't think that real underlying problem is addressed by an antitrust exemption.”
IS WIKILEAKS A 'HOSTILE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE?' — Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are looking to classify WikiLeaks, a site that's become known for dropping troves of hacked DNC emails and U. S. government documents, as an actor that ""resemble[s] a non-state hostile intelligence service,"" Pro Cybersecurity's Tim Starks reports. This tenet was included in the committee's annual intelligence authorization, a bill it adopted 14-1 last month. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) was the sole ""no"" vote, due to questions over the WikiLeaks categorization. “My concern is that the use of the novel phrase ‘non-state hostile intelligence service’ may have legal, constitutional and policy implications, particularly should it be applied to journalists inquiring about secrets,” Wyden said in a statement.
DOJ NARROWS SCOPE OF DREAMHOST CASE — ""The US Department of Justice is rescinding its request for IP logs that would have revealed visitors to a website used to plan a protest during Donald Trump’s inauguration,"" Gizmodo reports.

Microsoft has used TV White Spaces to help rural farms leverage precision agriculture tools, and it's pushing to take advantage of such tech to increase access to rural broadband, an effort DelBene has previously vocalized her support for.
KHANNA PLANS NET NEUTRALITY DEFENSE — Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) is joining former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to defend the commission’s 2015 net neutrality rules during a Sept. 18 event hosted by Mozilla and the Internet Archive in San Francisco. Khanna, who reps part of Silicon Valley, wants to rally support for the existing rules rather than jump into legislative negotiations, as Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee say they want.
— “I haven’t seen anything from the Republican proposals right now that would do anything positive,” Khanna, who isn’t a member of E&C, told John before departing for recess. Current FCC policies put in place under Democrats are “strong,” Khanna said, including the Communications Act Title II classification of broadband — a source of pushback from ISPs and Republicans. Khanna said he would back legislative codification of the 2015 Open Internet rules, “but I don’t think that consensus is there.”

FACEBOOK NEWS GETS SMARTER? — The social media giant on Tuesday started including some publisher logos next to news articles in its trending and search sections, part of its “ongoing efforts to enhance people’s recognition of the sources of news distributed on our platform,” it said in a blog post. Facebook’s goal is to “extend these to all places where people consume news on our platform.” The company cited research showing many users don't remember the source of information they read on social media.
SCORING INTERNET POLICY — Golden Frog, a software and online services company focused on privacy and security, has a scorecard out on legislation that affects the internet. It rates bills including the BROWSER Act, Mobile Now and the Email Privacy Act. Each bill is given a score from 1 to 5, based on the firm's take on policy execution and the purpose of each measure. Here's the site's review of the BROWSER Act (H. R. 2520 (115)), which would require both ISPs and edge providers like Google to institute opt-in policies for access to users' browsing histories: ""This is a bad bill. It regulates all edge services, which is not necessary."" Tech groups have broadly opposed this legislation, arguing that their privacy practices are already policed by the FTC and don't need to be curbed further. Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), the bill's sponsor, has said it would help preserve consistency by ensuring that the FTC is addressing the issue across the board.
BRAD SMITH TO SPEAK AT MONTANA JOBS SUMMIT — Microsoft President Brad Smith is one of the keynotes lined up for Sen. Steve Daines' biennial high-tech jobs summit in Missoula, Mont., on Oct. 8 and 9.

AT&T-TIME WARNER MERGER HITS SNAG IN BRAZIL — The General Superintendence of Brazil's anti-trust regulator, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense, has expressed concern that the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner will harm competition in South America's most populous country. The deal could give the entity incentive to discriminate against competitors and raise consumer prices, officials said. They suggested the merger should be rejected or subject to conditions. A formal decision will be made in the coming months.
— It's unclear whether Brazil's trepidation could affect the merger's path in the United States, at least in part because the competitive landscape and industry players are different in each country. Nevertheless, advocacy group Public Knowledge said the concerns reflect the worries of U. S. consumers and ""should help convince"" the Justice Department to reject the transaction. For its part, AT&T said in a statement that the merger would be a boon for consumers and pledged to address the concerns of Brazilian regulators. The merger still needs the green light from regulators in Chile, Brazil and the U.S., AT&T said.
— How reader response shapes Medium's new payment system: ""Medium plans to start letting more and more authors publish paywalled articles. And to determine how they get paid, the blogging platform has selected a fairly unorthodox method: claps, which are, basically, Medium’s equivalent of a Like,"" The Verge reports. ""Medium will weight payments toward whichever articles a subscriber gives the most claps to.""

"NBC News President Noah Oppenheim told staffers at a town hall meeting Wednesday that “the notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us.”
That the president of a network news division, which just hours earlier infuriated the president of the United States with a critical story, has to reiterate that journalists are expected to hold the powerful accountable speaks to the heightened scrutiny of the media as horrifying allegations of sexual harassment, and even rape, continue to pile up against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.
Since The New York Times opened the floodgates last week with revelations of payments to women, journalists have been dogged by questions about the news industry’s apparent failure to aggressively report on Weinstein’s decades-long “open secret.” He allegedly engaged in predatory behavior toward women that was widely discussed in Hollywood yet only publicly spilled out as punchlines on “30 Rock” and at the Academy Awards.
Even The Times hasn’t been immune from criticism, with former Hollywood reporter Sharon Waxman claiming the paper enabled Weinstein more than a decade ago by declining to publish her reporting on his sexual misconduct following pressure from the film mogul. Then-culture editor Jonathan Landman dismissed her claim, and current executive editor Dean Baquet called it “unimaginable.” New York magazine also denied claims it ended an investigation last year into Weinstein’s behavior after pressure from him.
Nonetheless, Weinstein’s ability to court and bully the press is increasingly coming into view, from leaking self-serving stories to gossip columns to threatening lawsuits and withholding access in response to unflattering coverage.
Michael Hirschorn, a media executive and editor at New York magazine in the mid-1990s, recalled how Weinstein “held so many cards” when it came to dealing with magazines and newspapers at the time. Hirschorn — who has said he was part of two efforts to investigate allegations about Weinstein — said that movie advertising was a major source of revenue for publications back then. Weinstein could block that, or cut off access to stars sought by editors for magazine covers.
“His ability to punish the bottom line of any publication that stepped out of line was significant,” said Hirschorn. And Weinstein also had the ability to place derogatory stories, Hirschorn said, and ""seemed to have a direct line to a number of gossip columns, including ‘Page Six.’”
He also launched a magazine, Talk, with Tina Brown. She recalled Tuesday that ""many hacks writing gossip columns or entertainment coverage were on the Miramax payroll"" through development deals with the company. But if a gossip reporter didn’t write something Weinstein liked, he could blow up. “I’m the scariest motherf--ker you’ll ever have as an enemy in this town!” Lloyd Grove, who was a gossip columnist for the New York Daily News from 2003 to 2006, recalled Wednesday.
“The ability, through a combination of complicity, fear — illegitimate and legitimate — and money, made it very likely you were not going to be able to get these things in print,” Hirschorn said of the long-whispered allegations. “And once that happened, there was a sense of hopelessness. Why even pursue it? It’s not going to happen.”
Some journalists kept taking stabs at the still-untold story below the surface of all the glitz and glamour.
“Over many years, many news organizations have circled this story and faced a great deal of pressure in doing so,” Ronan Farrow, the author of a blockbuster New Yorker report, said Tuesday night on MSNBC. But it’s what Farrow didn’t say that raised eyebrows inside and outside 30 Rock. Host Rachel Maddow asked Farrow why NBC — the network that identified him just a day earlier on-air as an investigative correspondent — didn’t publish the story. He said to ask NBC News executives.
Farrow, a former daytime MSNBC host who shifted to a reporting role after his show’s 2015 cancellation, said he spent 10 months on the story, beginning at NBC. Accounts have varied over how deep Farrow got in the project at 30 Rock before heading to The New Yorker.
An NBC source told POLITICO on Tuesday that what Farrow had early on at NBC “was nowhere close” to what appeared in the magazine or The Times. Grove reported that scripts were being “prepared and vetted” at NBC and that Farrow’s reporting was undergoing fact-checking and legal vetting. And Farrow told Maddow on Tuesday night that he had “an explosively reportable piece” while still at NBC and that The New Yorker realized that immediately.
On Wednesday morning, Oppenheim addressed the lost scoop at a scheduled NBC News town hall meeting, which was also attended by NBC News chief Andy Lack. He defended management’s decision-making and didn’t want NBC staff to feel “there was anything to be ashamed of,” according to remarks provided by the network.
Oppenheim said NBC “launched” Farrow on the Weinstein story, “encouraged him” to pursue it, “and supported him and gave him resources to report that story over many, many months.” He added that “like pretty much every newspaper and magazine in L. A. and New York, The New York Times up until last week, New York magazine, The Hollywood Reporter, you name it, we were on that long list of places that chased this thing, tried to nail it but weren’t ultimately the ones who broke it.”
This past summer, he said, management “didn’t feel that we had all the elements that we needed to air it” and Farrow — who no longer works at the network on an exclusive basis — “very understandably wanted to keep forging ahead.” At The New Yorker, Oppenheim said, Farrow did “a ton more extraordinary work” and “greatly expanded the scope of his reporting,” and therefore the final published version “was not the story that we were looking at when we made our judgment several months ago.”
Oppenheim didn’t address specifically what Farrow had early on at NBC, though it’s been reported he had already obtained a 2015 NYPD recording of Weinstein admitting to groping model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, a claim the mogul denied at the time.
The groping incident made tabloid headlines in April 2015, and the New York Daily News even reported at the time that Weinstein’s denial might be contradicted by an NYPD sting tape, which hadn’t surfaced until Farrow’s piece. The same day, entertainment gossip site Defamer — once part of the Gawker Media empire — asked readers for information about Weinstein’s “open secret"" and optimistically predicted that “accusations that once existed only as loud whispers were finally being dragged into the light.”
But Battilana Gutierrez was smeared in the gossip pages as a gold digger, and the extent of Weinstein's misdeeds would remain in the dark for years.",0

The readers have spoken: You can pry their newspapers from their cold, dead hands.
Print is the past and online is the future, as all can attest. But a new study by Neil Thurman indicates that print isn’t quite prepared to surrender to online. According to Thurman’s research, a whopping 88.5 percent of the total time U. K. readers devote to 11 national newspaper brands—Guardian, Telegraph, Times, Mail, Mirror, et al.—is spent on the print edition. Only 7.49 percent of reader time goes to mobile and a mere 4 percent to PCs.
Guardian readers spend 43 minutes a day on the print version and only 0.68 minutes on the online version. Readers of The Mail spend 39 minutes on print versus 2 minutes to the online edition. And so on down the list. “U.K. national newspaper brands engage each of their online visitors for an average of less than 30 seconds a day, but their print readers for an average of 40 minutes,” Thurman writes.
Are the Brits just slow readers? Nope, says Thurman, who drew on a year’s worth of data: “Time spent reading print newspapers doesn’t vary much country-to-country, and neither do online dwell times.”
Thurman’s work follows the research of University of Texas scholar H. Iris Chyi, who criticized the newspaper industry for splurging on online editions when real profits remain in the fading print product. In correspondence, Thurman points to a Deloitte study that found that 88 percent of the newspaper industry’s revenues comes from print, making time spent reading and money collected a near percentage match. Like Chyi, Thurman thinks newspapers need to rethink resources they’ve allocated to online editions. He believes his research should raise questions about the wisdom of the online expansion of U.K. newspapers to nondomestic markets: Both the Guardian and the Mail have taken their product to the United States and elsewhere. The Guardian, which has invested deeply in its online editions, reported declines last summer in its digital revenues. In the fall, it announced that it would cut 30 percent of its U.S. staff.
The study butters the toasty feelings for print that I expressed last year. As convenient as a smartphone may be when you want to sneak a nibble of news or gather a few sports scores and the weather report on the fly, for a genuine reading experience, nothing yet beats ink on paper. It’s telling that Thurman found smartphones outperforming PCs for reader time, indicating perhaps that if people are going to sit and read they’d rather do it on something other than a monitor.
If readers find newspapers so absorbing, why do media types burn endless talk on the tens of millions who visit their online sites? “Our website has 15 million uniques a month!” they say. “Oh, yeah? Our website draws 22 million!” What they’re thrilled about is “reach,” which Thurman defines as a “measure of whether someone has been exposed to a media brand but [that] tells us nothing about how much attention they paid to the content.” Yes, gillions of unique browsers make touch-and-go landings and on lots of websites, but most of them move on before absorbing any of the content or partaking of the advertising messages.
Thurman’s findings help reframe the rise of online and the decline of print as a debate between the number of “readers” and the actual time spent reading. The reach vs. time spent debate, says Thurman, “matters in an era of multi-platform media brands and consumption when reaching someone online often means a fleeting engagement against the deeper encounter permitted by print.” When it comes to newspaper news, the print product is walloping the online version in terms of reader engagement.
Everybody accepts that newspapers have been bleeding circulation for the past decade, but the continued devotion of the readers to print even though they charge high prices compared to free or at least cheap websites remains an under-told story. Writes Thurman, “[T]he metric of time spent reveals an inconvenient truth about newspapers’ online experiment.” Given all the developer money spent on developing news for smartphone users, it’s a bit of a shock to discover how little time that large audience invests in the format.
Online still outperforms newsprint in many vital areas. It’s superb at breaking news and boutique news, and it remains the cheapest and easiest way to publish. But Thurman’s paper, along with Chyi’s findings, provides fresh ammo to the debate about print’s future that’s been raging since 1993, when novelist Michael Crichton famously predicted in Wired that not only newspapers but mass media would be dead in 10 years. Newspapers, it seems, are always dying. But thanks to their loyal readers, who hold them tight and long, they refuse to die.

"A Chinese newspaper on Monday castigated the U. S. Navy for being more of a ""dangerous obstacle"" than a protective force while sailing through Asia-Pacific waters -- the written rebuke coming as the Navy chief ordered a wide investigation of the Pacific Fleet following two recent collisions that left at least seven sailors dead.
China Dailypublished the editorial saying the U. S. Navy, despite its claim to protect the ""freedom of navigation"" in the South China Sea, is becoming a ""hazard"" in the region after two significant collisions. The stern editorial came hours after USS John S. McCain collided with a 600-foot Alnic MC -- an oil and chemical tanker -- early Monday morning, injuring five sailors and leaving 10 others missing.
""The US Navy, which likes to claim its presence can help safeguard 'freedom of navigation' in the South China Sea, is proving to be an increasing hindrance to ships sailing in Asian waters,"" the newspaper wrote.
SEARCH UNDERWAY FOR 10 SAILORS AFTER USS JOHN S. MCCAIN COLLISION NEAR SINGAPORE; SHIP HAS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE
Monday's collision is the second in two months, the previous instance coming in June, when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a merchant ship off the Japanese coast, killing seven U. S. sailors.
A U. S. defense official said on Monday the Navy was undertaking a wide-ranging investigation of the Pacific Fleet, and Defense Secretary James Mattis said he ""fully"" supported Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson's review.
Citing both the USS Fitzgerald and the USS John S. McCain incidents, the Chinese newspaper said the ""sloppiness"" of the Navy crews and the U. S. warships sailing ""without observing maritime traffic rules"" is threatening the safety of sailing through Asian waters.
""While the US Navy is becoming a dangerous obstacle in Asian waters, China has been making joint efforts with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to draw up a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea and it has boosted navigational safety by constructing five lighthouses on its islands,"" the editorial stated.
It continued: ""Anyone should be able to tell who is to blame for militarizing the waters and posing a threat to navigation.""
The U. S. Navy did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.
The Navy announced in August the investigation into the USS Fitzgerald collision found poor seamanship and issues with keeping watch caused the deadly incident.
In the aftermath of that incident, the Navy was already looking at changing the qualification process for junior officers and sailors to stand watch on the bridge and in the combat information center, where sailors navigate the ship. The military requires pilots to get eight hours of sleep before flying, but similar regulations do not exist for officers and crews who drive warships -- carrying hundreds of sailors -- through sea lanes.
Navy officers told Fox News there are too many ""administrative functions"" on the ship and not enough time focused on training — safely navigating the ship. Many captains ""lose focus,"" partly because of all the administrative messages that must be sent and due to inspections.
The blunt Chinese message toward the Navy comes as tensions have risen between the U. S. and China over North Korea.President Trump attacked Chinaon Twitter in late July, saying the rogue regime's neighboring country was ""doing nothing"" to solve the North Korea issue, declaring China ""just talk"" and no action.
""We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
China warned North Korea earlier this month it wouldn't come to the country's aid if the U. S. took military action against the nation. ChinesenewspaperThe Global Timeswrote that the country showed ""when [North Korea's] actions jeopardize China’s interests, China will respond with a firm hand.""
A dispute over man-made islands in the South China Sea has also caused friction between the U. S. and China.
