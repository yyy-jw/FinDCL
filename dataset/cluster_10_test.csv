"As asteroid 2012 TC4 approaches earth and conspiracy theories run amok, one site is giving the opportunity to actually watch the celestial event. The house-sized asteroid is scheduled to be at the closest point to the earth at about 8 pm, EDT tonight.
The astronomy broadcasting service Slooh will air a webcast at 8 p.m. EDT tonight (0000 GMT on October 12) focused on the space rock 2012 TC4, which will zoom by Earth just a few hours later. You canwatch the show directly on Slooh’s website, but courtesy of Slooh, you can alsowatch the webcast on Space.com.
2012 TC4 has fascinated scientists and conspiracy theorists alike. Slooh says:
“On Wednesday, October 11th at 5 PM PDT | 8 PM EDT | 00:00 UTC (International Times),Sloohwill live stream Asteroid 2012 TC4’s close approach to Earth, as it passes the planet at an estimated distance of 31,000 miles (just an eighth of the distance between our planet and the moon). Asteroid 2012 TC4 is no stranger to close encounters: in 2012, the asteroid stunned observers on Earth as it plunged to only 94,000 kilometers above our atmosphere, just a week after its discovery by the PanSTARRS observatory in Hawaii.
“And now it’s back. On October 12th 2017, 2012 TC4 will once again fly by Earth on a super-close trajectory. At the moment of the asteroid’s approach,Sloohwill train its telescopes on 2012 TC4 in an attempt to capture the fast-moving space rock as it passes between Earth and the Moon. Commentary from our asteroid experts will explore the threat they pose to our planet, both in reality and in the human imagination. We will be interviewing two Sparks and Honey cultural forecasters who will share their insights on the current trending of space in popular culture from their report, “Exploration Innovation Brought Down to Earth,” and the role they believe asteroids will play in the perhaps not-so-distant future.
“Viewers can use the hashtag #sloohto ask questions during the show.” –Space.com
Astronomers estimate 2012 TC4 to be 39 feet to 89 feet (12 to 27 meters) wide. That puts it in the same general size class as the object thatexploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinskin February 2013, injuring more than 1,000 people.
But scientists want to assure those who are a little anxious that there’s no danger of an impact by 2012 TC4 on this pass. Astronomers stress this after conspiracies surface saying an impact is possible. But don’t let that fool you either. The space rock will get eerily close; a little to close for comfort even, coming within a mere 31,200 miles (50,200 kilometers) of Earth’s surface at 1:42 a.m. EDT (0542 GMT) on Thursday,according to the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, which is based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

"Organization:
Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were ""resolved"" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the Wayback Machine, providing a path back to lost websites and work.
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
The Archive Team Panic Downloads are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.
Archive Team now searches many, many news sites, including extensive worldwide and obscure sources, to capture unique news stories for history.
Vice President Pence broke yet another Senate tie, this time killing a rule that allows class-action lawsuits against banks and credit card companies.     USA TODAYFile photo taken in 2013 shows Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, speaking with the USA TODAY Editorial Board in McLean, Va. The U.S. Senate's vote to kill a rule that would allow consumers to file class-action lawsuits over disputes with banks, credit card companies and other financial service firmsmeansthat such caseswill now likely be resolved through arbitration.President Trump is expected to approve the rollback, dealing a major setback to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal watchdog created after the national financial crisis. The consumer bureau finalized the rule in July after issuing a2015 report about mandatory arbitration requirements.Richard Cordray, the bureau's director, said the outcome ""preserves a two-tiered justice system"" that potentially could benefit Wells Fargo, which is coping with a scandal over millions of potentially unauthorized consumer accounts, and credit-rating giant Equifax, which in September disclosed a cyberattackthat could compromise personal data for nearly half of all Americans.Financial service providers disagree. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce characterized the watchdog'sreport as ""flawed"" and said in an alert issued Tuesday that ""the bureau’s own data shows that class actions provide little or no benefit to consumers while providing lucrative paydays to class-action attorneys.""More: Senate overturns new rule allowing class-action suits against banksMore: Bank customers fork over $15 billion in fees in 2016, CFPB saysHere are answers to common questions about arbitration:They are requirements typically found in the fine print of agreements that consumers sign to obtain checkingaccounts, credit cards, various kinds of loans and other financial products.Just over half of all credit card loans are subject to arbitration clauses, the consumer bureau study found. Roughly 8% of banks, covering 44% of insured deposits, includethe clausesin their contracts for checking accounts, the study showed.What do the arbitration clauses say about class-action lawsuits?Nearly all the clauses studied by the consumer bureau stated that disputes with the financial-service providers ""may not proceed on a class basis,"" the watchdog's reportfound.
Wells Fargo has filed court papers demanding arbitration to settle lawsuits filed by 80 customers over its phony accounts scandal. Susan Antilla, a contributor with TheStreet, writes that Wells Fargo has done well in previous arbitration cases, prevailing in 28 consumer-initiated disputes decided by arbitrators since the summer of 2012. Video provided by TheStreet     NewslookHow often have consumers filed for arbitration proceedings?The consumer bureau studied American Arbitration Association data for 2010-2012 in cases involving credit cards; checking account/debit cards; payday loans; prepaidcards; private student loans; and auto loans. In all, consumers filed an average of 411 cases each year. The average debt amount under dispute was nearly $16,000, and the median was roughly $11,000, the report found.What were the outcomes?In all, 78 of 341 cases resolved by arbitrators during the two-year period ended with judgments in favor of the consumers. The total amount of affirmative relief and debt forbearance was $361,540, the report showed.The consumer bureau identified 187 lawsuits that sought class-action status from 2010-2012 involving the same six financial products in its analysis of arbitration cases. The cases were filed in federal court or selected state courts by at least one person who sought to represent a similar group of consumers.How did those cases turn out?About 25% were resolved through individual settlements, and 12% of the cases reached final approval of a class-action settlement by February 2014, when the consumer bureau's review period ended.
The Chamber of Commerce, the largest lobbying group in Washington by far, has filed a lawsuit against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop customers from filing class action lawsuits. Jose Sepulveda (@josesepulvedatv) has more.     Buzz60How did the financial outcomes compare to those in arbitration cases?In all, 422 consumer class actions were approved in federal courts between 2008 and 2012. Most involved debt collection, credit cards, checking accounts or credit reporting. The annual average of the aggregatetotal from the settlements was roughly $540 million per year, the consumer bureau study found.What about the individual consumers in the class-action settlements?Approximately 34 million class members had gotten or were scheduled to receive cash payments as the result of filing a claim or automatic distributions from the settlements, the watchdogstudy found.What do financial service providers say about allowing class-action lawsuits?Based on an analysis of the consumer bureau's report, the American Bankers Association, the Consumer Bankers Association, and the Financial Services Roundtable said the disputed rule would prompt consumers to file 6,042 additional class-action lawsuits every five years.
Nearly half of the U.S. population’s personal information may have been exposed  after a massive data breach involving Equifax.     TimeWhat's the potential financial impact of that many new cases?The cost of defending and settling the lawsuits would run as high as $5.23 billion ever five years, and some of that financial burden would be passed on to consumers, the three financial associations said, again citing the consumer bureau's data.What would be the financial impact for consumers?Again citingthe federal watchdog's study data, the three financial service providers said average consumer relief in arbitration proceedings was $5,389, compared witha $32.35 average in class-action case settlements. The cost of initiating arbitration is $200, compared with the $400 cost of filing a federal class-action lawsuit, the providers said.Share your feedback to help improve our site experience!",0
"Globalist billionaire George Soros bet millions last quarter against MGM, the company that owns Mandalay Bay Hotel, and is now set to profit to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, according to data released by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
George Soros manages an investment fund, Soros Fund Management, that is required by law to file quarterly statements with the SEC to disclose its positions.
On 14 August this year, Soros Fund Management filed a 13f. The statement previous to that was filed on 15 May. By analyzing these two forms, we can see the changes George Soros made to the portfolio in that time.
When it comes to gambling stocks, Soros does not seem too interested, with the exception of MGM, the company that owns Mandalay Bay and the other Las Vegas casinos that were on lockdown during the 1 October attack, with reports of active shooters on the premises.
All of these hotel-casinos are facing an avalanche of lawsuits and share prices, in particular at Mandalay Bay, are expected to plummet.
Soros’ 15 May statement viewable at the SEC website here.
WYNN – Soros sold all 3,500 shares, leaving him with no position.
MGM – Soros bought put options, which means he was short the shares, to the tune of 1,350,000 shares.
Soros’ 14 August statement viewable at the SEC website here.
What does shorting a stock mean?
When watching a sports game, would you bet on who’s going to lose?
That’s essentially what “short-sellers” are doing – they are betting that a stock will fall in price. (“Long investors” bet that prices will rise.)
Rather than trying to pick a winner, short-sellers, like Soros’ gamble on MGM/Mandalay Bay, are trying to pick a loser.
Daily Worth provide a simplified example of how shorting a stock works:
Say you think Company ABC is overpriced at $50 a share. You borrow 100 shares from your broker—pay interest on the loan—and sell them for $5,000. Time ticks on, and as you suspected, the stock price falls. At $40 a share, you buy 100 shares for $4,000 and return them to your broker. You walk away $1,000 richer, minus investing costs.
As things stand, George Soros, through his Soros Management Fund, is set to bank hundreds of millions of dollars in the wake of the Las Vegas tragedy.
Soros is 87-years-old and still money grubbing after all these years – while laughing at us all the way to the bank.",1
"More than 1,500 emergency personnel were on the scene of a raging wildfire burning in Southern California Wednesday that forced tens of thousands to flee — a blaze that veteran firefighters said is unlike anything they’ve seen.
The size of the so-called Blue Cut fire in the Cajon Pass near San Bernardino, around 60 miles east of Los Angeles, was revised late Wednesday from 30,000 acres to just over 25,600 acres, or about 40 square miles, fire officials said. More accurate mapping led to the revision.
Fire officials also said the wildfire was 4 percent contained Wednesday evening.
""In my 40 years of fighting fire, I’ve never seen fire behavior so extreme,” San Bernardino County Fire incident commander Mike Wakoski said.
The fire, which broke out Tuesday morning, led to mandatory evacuation orders covering 82,000 people and burned ""numerous structures,"" according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.
Around 34,500 homes are under the evacuation orders, fire officials said. The fire began in the Cajon Pass near an exit off of Interstate 15, officials said.
""Right now we are seeing very, very strong winds that are just fanning this fire,” Cal Fire public information officer Daniel Berlant said at a briefing Wednesday.
No deaths have been reported but two firefighters were were hurt and briefly hospitalized when they became trapped while defending homes and assisting evacuations in the Swarthout Canyon area, the San Bernardino Fire Department said.
Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency. The California Air National Guard on Wednesday activated two C-130J Hercules air tankers to help firefighting efforts. Each can drop 3,000 gallons of water or retardant, the guard said.
Officials did not release a number of homes that have burned, but warned the number could be high.
""It hit hard. It hit fast, with an intensity that we've never seen before,"" San Bernardino County Fire Chief Mark Hartwig told reporters. He warned that many families will return home ""to nothing.""
San Bernardino National Forest spokesman John Miller described the conditions as ""explosive.""
California is in its fifth year of a historic drought, exacerbating wildfire conditions. There were eight major wildfires burning in the state Wednesday, Cal Fire said.
In addition to the air tankers, the California National Guard said it activated hundreds of soldiers to serve as hand crews at fire lines in Monterey County, where the Soberanes Fire is burning.
That fire near Big Sur has burned a little more than 76,680 acres, or more than 119 square miles, and destroyed 57 homes, Cal Fire said. It was 60 percent contained Wednesday, the department said.
The fire, which broke out the morning of July 22, has been blamed on an illegal campfire. A bulldozer operator was killed in a rollover accident while fighting the blaze.
Meanwhile, more progress was made containing the Clayton Fire in Lake County. The fire, which has burned nearly 4,000 acres since it broke out Saturday and was 50 percent contained, Cal Fire said.
Evacuation orders for a portion of Lower Lake were lifted Wednesday, but an updated damage assessment revealed that 268 structures were destroyed, including 175 homes, Cal Fire said.",0
"Many people get into the crypto currency market to avoid the heavy and stifling taxation levied on any income in every country across the globe. But now, the IRS is desperatelytrying to hit almost 14,000 Coinbase customers with a tax summons.
Digital currency exchange startup Coinbase is pushing back against a renewed court effort by the Internal Revenue Service to obtain information on some of its customers. Earlier this month, the IRS sought tonarrow the scopeof its investigation of the startup’s customers after running into opposition from both Coinbase itself as well as several of its customers.
This dispute, however, datesback to November, when the tax agency first went to court in a bid to obtain user records from Coinbase for the period between 2013 and 2015, with the overt and obvious goal of taxing customers for their trading of and/or income from crypto currency. Ultimately, the IRS told the court that it would limit its investigation to customers who have conducted at least $20,000 in business during those years.
But Coinbase claims that the IRS is still pulling the wool over eyes.Coinbase goes on to say that, under the narrowed summons, approximately 14,355 accounts would be subject to the data request, and most likely, ultimately, a tax summons. The start-up requested that the court reject the tax agency’s petition to enforce the summons. Further, Coinbase is seeking an evidentiary hearing, criticizing the IRS for what it believes is a lack of evidence that its customers are trying to avoid their taxes.
Of course, users of crypto currency try to avoid taxes, yet the wonderful thing about crypto currency is that there is a gigantic hole where evidentiary support should be. That’s why it’s so appealing to the vast majority of those who have any stake in Bitcoin, or other crypto currency for that matter, whatsoever.
“The Government has now ‘narrowed’ its requests, providing no evidence to support its contentions and no explanation for why it has done so,” the startup’s attorneys wrote. But anyone with half a functioning brain knows that the IRS is solely seeking more tax revenueand they are desperately trying to extort or steal as much from as many as possible.

"Aspartame breaks down into three toxic components:
1. Methanol.
This is poisonous alcohol. In the body, methanol breaks down into formaldehyde, which is a poison.
2. Phenylalanine.
This decreases the amount serotonin in your brain, which leads to mood swings (depressions) and an increased appetite! That is why aspartame is one of the main causes for the current obesity epidemic.
The US Department of Health has recorded 92 (!) symptoms following complaints about aspartame. In fact, over 80% of all complaints filed with FDA are related to aspartame consumption!
Some of the brand names for aspartame:
AminoSweet, NutraSweet, Equal, NatraTaste, Canderel, Spoonful, Equal-Measure, etc.
Aspartame is used in any of the following products:
Sugarfree, Light, Diet, Zero (Coke, Sprite & Fanta), Coke 007, Pepsi Max, Crystal Clear, Low-Calorie, Crystal Light, No Sugar Added, Smint, Stimorol Ice, Stimorol Fusion, Freedent, Mentos, Sportlife, etc.
Do no longer believe the lies of the food industry and the ‘main stream’ media. Contrary to what so-called ‘health experts’ claim, aspartame is NOT safe!
In fact, aspartame is a sweet poison developed to make people sick so the pharmaceutical industry can sell expensive medication to ‘treat’ the chronic diseases that are caused by it’s use.
Avoid this toxic chemical for 60 days and discover how your health will improve dramatically!
Other artificial sweeteners that you should avoid:
Acesulfame K (E950), Cyclamate (E952), Isomalt (E953), Saccharin (E954), Sucralose or Splenda (E955), Alitame (E956), Neohesperidine (E959), Neotame (E961), Salt of Aspartame-Acesulfame (E962), Maltitol (E965), Lactitol (E966), Sorbitol (E420), Mannitol (E421), Glycerol (E422).
According to a research review conducted by South African scientists from the University of Pretoria and the University of Limpopo and published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, high intake of the artificial sweetener aspartame may lead to the degeneration of brain cells and various mental disorders.
The researchers also noted that aspartame appears to cause excessive signaling of nerve cells, and nerve cell damage or even death. By disrupting the functioning of the cells’ mitochondria, or energy source, aspartame leads to a cascade of effects on the whole system.
“The energy systems for certain required enzyme reactions become compromised, thus indirectly leading to the inability of enzymes to function optimally,” the researchers wrote.
Same face, different name
Previous research was reviewed and it was found that aspartame, marketed as NutraSweet, Equal, Canderal and Tropicana Slim, leads to both direct and indirect changes in the brain when consumed in high quantities. It was found that the chemical can disrupt amino acid metabolism and structure, degrade nucleic acids, and interfere with the function of nerve cells and hormonal systems. It also appears to change the concentration of certain neurotransmitters in the brain.
Aspartame is used in more than 6,000 products around the world. It has been controversial since its introduction, with a number of studies linking it to cancer and neurological and behavioral disorders. Side effects have been reported by many people including headaches, insomnia and even seizures from aspartame consumption.
The FDA and the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA), however, continue to insist that the sweetener is safe.
You can’t imagine how hard soft drinks sweetened with Aspartame are on your body.
A must-see for anybody with a sweet tooth, this exposé reveals the dangers of Aspartame consumption.
Americans constantly obsess over the latest diet fads and skinny trends, yet we’re one of the unhealthiest nations on the planet.
According to the US Surgeon General, obesity plagues more than 30% of Americans, killing over 300,000 people every year! Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are also all on the rise, with one of the main culprits in this disturbing trend being sugar. Almost 20% of our daily calorie intake comes from refined white sugar. That works out to about 150 pounds of sugar per year!
Consumed in small amounts, sugar actually helps your metabolism and supplies a quick boost of energy. In excess, sugar adds nothing but empty calories to your body. Many people have recognized this and now opt for sugar free alternatives, allowing for the rise of the artificial sugar industry. The most prevalent artificial sugar in our food supply today is called aspartame, which is also recognized as NutraSweet or Equal. Aspartame has made its way into more than 6,000 products including almost all diet sodas, chewing gum, frozen desserts, yogurt, and even vitamins and cough drops.
200 times sweeter than sugar, aspartame is a combination of two amino acids: aspartic acid and phenylalanine.
Even though the safety of aspartame has been affirmed by the Food and Drug Administration 26 times in the past 23 years, the FDA has received more complaints about adverse reactions to aspartame than any other food ingredient in the agency’s history. In fact, at least 30% of the US population is sensitive to even moderate doses of aspartame and may suffer several symptoms. Immediate reactions include severe headaches, dizziness, attention difficulties, memory loss, throat swelling, and seizures.
Aspartame, the artificial sweetener found in many diet sodas and used as an ‘alternative’ sweetener, has been found recently to have detrimental – specifically, cancerous – effects.

"Department of Homeland Security officials have warned the White House that they may have trouble processing 50,000 refugees next year, putting additional pressure on President Donald Trump to lower the cap on refugees entering the United States to the lowest point in decades.
In private meetings with White House officials in recent weeks, DHS officials have raised logistical concerns about handling 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2018 if the president decides to maintain the cap that he imposed as part of the travel ban, according to two administration officials.
One of the officials said the department was swamped with a backlog of asylum applications, which have skyrocketed in recent years. In June, U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had roughly 275,000 pending “affirmative” asylum cases — when someone arrives in the U.S. and requests safe haven. The figure amounts to a more than 600 percent increase in the backlog compared with December 2013.
The pressure from DHS comes as Trump faces a vanishing window to make the decision on refugee admissions. According to the statute that governs the program, the president should determine refugee levels before the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.
Though administration officials say Trump has not yet made up his mind, they expect him to lower the refugee cap below 50,000.
DHS has recommended setting the fiscal year 2018 refugee ceiling at 40,000, the administration officials said.
“DHS does not comment on the Administration’s internal deliberations with regard to the FY18 refugee admissions ceiling,” department spokesman David Lapan said in a statement. “However, in setting the admissions ceiling, the factors taken into account include the workload capacity of all program partners, including the vetting agencies; and the national security interests of the United States.”
Meanwhile, National Security Council and Domestic Policy Council staff have recommended two options to the president: a 50,000 refugee cap and a 40,000 refugee cap, the administration officials said. With Trump in New York City, there is unlikely to be a formal meeting of top administration officials to discuss the issue, but the president is expected to consult his top aides as the deadline nears.
“Nothing final at this time,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders wrote in an email.
The administration still needs to consult with members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees to explain why the admissions are justified by humanitarian concerns or the national interest. As of Monday, that meeting had not taken place, according to a Senate aide.
While the cap would be the lowest in the program’s history, refugee admissions dipped below 50,000 during four separate years during the administration of President George W. Bush. In the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, admissions fell below 30,000 in 2002 and 2003 and ranged from 40,000 to 50,000 in 2006 and 2007.
At the inception of the resettlement program in 1980, the U. S. accepted more than 207,000 refugees and admissions during the early 1990s consistently rose above 100,000. The program turned inward post-9/11 but gradually began to expand to levels that hit nearly 85,000 in fiscal year 2016.
Despite that history, Trump has faced intense pressure from conservatives to limit the number of refugees who enter the United States, including from his own advisers, like White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller.
The New York Times reported on Monday that the Trump administration rejected a Health and Human Services Department study detailing the economic benefits of accepting refugees.
In a speech to the United Nations on Tuesday, which was written by Miller, Trump appeared to offer a rationale for a strict refugee cap.
“We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process,” he said. “For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.”
Refugee resettlement organizations would like the cap to be at least 75,000 — a figure they say the U. S. can and should shoulder.
Melanie Nezer, vice president of public affairs at HIAS, a resettlement agency formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, said 50,000 or fewer admissions would be “an abdication” of the United States’ shared responsibility for humanitarian relief around the world.
“This would be really a signal of a strong retreat,” she said. “And there’s no reason for it.”",0
"Some of the greatest stories reach their climax when a hero who has been hounded by a villain doubles back to give chase, turning the hunter into the hunted. That’s what’s going on now in a fight between Cloudflare, an Internet content-delivery and security company, and Blackbird Technologies, a company that amasses patents for the sake of bringing lawsuits.
While a patent battle might not pump out adrenaline like Luke’s duel with Vader in “Return of the Jedi,” this one might still go down in history – especially since there’s a “Star Wars” bounty hunter involved.
Blackbird bills itself as no mere patent troll, but as a new, more efficient type of patent assertion entity. It doesn’t represent inventors, or even third-party patent-holding companies. Instead, it appears that Blackbird’s lawyers own the company, so they’re effectively representing themselves. (If you think that taking inventors out of the litigation process seems like a strange way to promote innovation, you’re right – although since Blackbird’s patent purchases involve what Blackbird has cryptically called “other good and valuable consideration,” it’s likely that the original inventors get some cut of Blackbird’s profits.
In March, Blackbird sued Cloudflare for infringement of a vague 1998 patent that covers technology used to add information to electronic communications,
such as inserting error messages when something goes wrong with a transmission.Instead of settling the lawsuit, as most targets of patent trolls do, Cloudflare vowed to fight in court. But that’s not all it did. Cloudflare also launched a frontal attack on Blackbird’s business.
A patent can be invalidated if someone can find clear evidence that the claimed invention wasn’t new at the time of patenting. But this isn’t easy. The evidence has to be pretty specific, and can’t have been cited and distinguished in the patent itself.
In “Project Jengo,” named after that Star Wars bounty hunter,
Cloudflare announced a $50,000 bounty (plus T-shirts) for this kind of ammunition to shoot down Blackbird’s patents. It’s apparently working: Patent bounty hunters have submitted documentation that can be used to make a case against the communications patent Blackbird asserted against Cloudflare, as well as a number of Blackbird’s other patents. Meanwhile, an anonymous donor has matched the $50,000 bounty offer, bringing the total war chest up to $100,000.
Why is Cloudflare doing this? When companies settle with patent trolls instead of fighting back, the trolls’ patents don’t get tested. Then – even if their patents are junk – the trolls can keep targeting companies. By standing and fighting, Cloudflare hopes to provide a public good, eliminating some low-quality patents that would otherwise be used against startups and others. Cloudflare’s response should also deter trolls from targeting Cloudflare in the future.
If this strategy becomes more common, it could provide some broader deterrence against patent trolling. But there’s something of a “swatting flies” problem: The U. S. Patent and Trademark Office issues so many low-quality patents that nobody can reasonably hope to kill all of them – at least not without a bounty as big as the Ritz.
So in the long run, legislative action will be needed to kill opportunistic patent trolling. But until that happens, Cloudflare is producing a compelling new hope in the “Patent Wars.”

"Assange also added that whilst they do everything they can to protect the anonymityof their sources, the sources themselves understand the danger they are under when they leak such information.
Seth Rich was shot in the back and killed near his home in Northwest Washington on July 10th, in what police reported was a failed robbery, but soon after the 27-year-old was killed, WikiLeaks announced they were offering a $20,000 reward for any information on theDemocratic National Committee staffer's death, promptingrumours that it was actually Rich that had leaked 20,000 emails from the Hillary Clinton Campaign to WikiLeaks.
ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich.

In a recent interview with Dutch TV show,Nieuwsuur, Assange told the host,
“Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks. There was a 27-year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered, just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.”
When the host asked if Seth Rich was one of their sources, Assange replied with,
“We have to understand how high the stakes are in the United States and our sources face serious risks”
When interviewer, Eelco Bosch van Rosenthal, went on to ask why he would speculate about someone being shot, Assange said it showed “our sources face serious risks.”",1
"Jack Andraka is living this famous quote by Edison. Jack is a 15 year old boy from Crownsville, Maryland. Jack watched a beloved family friend, who was like an uncle to him, die of pancreatic cancer. Rather than accept it as fact of life, he chose to become proactive.
He realized that a significant part of the problem was a lack of early detection tests. So he decided to come up with a test to detect cancer in its earliest stages. Pancreatic Cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death, taking 34,000 lives a year. Unfortunately this disease is usually detected late in its progression and has an extremely low survival rate after diagnosis.
Why is Andraka’s Test Different?
Current testing methods are 60 years old, cost on average $800, and miss 30% of all pancreatic cancers.
The test Jack developed is:
26,000 times less expensive
400 times more sensitive than the current standard of detection
He did his research using Google and Wikipedia as his primary research tools — online resources that are
available to virtually anyone on the planet with an internet connection.
The cost for his test: Three cents
It takes five minutes, and has a 100 percent accuracy rate. Compare that to the current standard, which employs 60-year-old technology, costs about $800, and misses 30 percent of all pancreatic cancers.

"College used to be a place for young adults to open their minds to different points of views and to grow into mature adults with their own thoughts. Now, colleges are a place where liberals jam their leftist agendas down student’s throats and basically teach them to completely close their minds, to hate everyone who does not agree with them, to fear words, and run and hide if anyone talks to them that is not a liberal.
Colleges are supposed to prepare young people to enter the workforce in the real world, instead, they are creating a society of weak minded people that are out of touch with reality. No employer is going to designate safe zones for them to run to and cry when someone hurts their feelings by simply saying something that they don’t agree with.
A large group of Notre Dame studentsprotested Mike Pence’s speech as commencement speaker for views he holds that are perfectly in line with Catholic social teaching. Watch the video below!
According to Allen B. West, Notre Dame is a Catholic university.
“It’s deeply humbling for me to participate in the 172nd commencement in Notre Dame’s 175th year,” Pence said to robust applause.
It’s not clear to what safe space the perpetually aggrieved liberal snowflakes hastily retreated.
The protest took the form of a walkout, with a few dozen students getting up and walking out as Pence began his speech. The University boasts roughly 12,000 students, so the walkout has to be compared in the context of a graduating class of around 3,000 or so students.
Not long after the students involved got up and began to walk away, you could hear loud boos:
I say if students walk out of a commencement speech then they don’t graduate, they might as well get prepared for the real world because if they walk out on their boss at a job then they won’t have a job.
Liberals!! So full of hate! You must stop hating. We must have peace in our country. We had an election, Trump won. Do you want to start a war? Do elections still have to mean to Democrats, or is winning now done with the sword, the fist, the gun? War is to be avoided like the plague!
However, the lawless spoiled force will not be tolerated. Be wise and seek peace and respect or you may not like what you are bringing! You had better grow up!

"As tensions escalate in Spain, Catalan Separatists have urged supporters to withdraw all their cash from banks in a move likely to cause a major bank run in the region.
In a tweet sent to 270,000 followers,Assemblea Nacional instructed supporters to pull all cash fromCaixaBank and Banco Sabadell branches between 8am and 9am Friday, in protest to the decision to shift their legal domiciles out of the region.
#BREAKING Civil society groups in Catalonia call for mass withdrawal of money from ATMs tomorrow at 8am to pressure Spanish government
“Go to 1 of the 5 main banks and take out as much cash as you want. Don’t forget, it’s your money”.
Civil society organizations in Catalonia call for a mass withdrawal of money from bank ATMs on Friday at 8am in order to pressure the Spanish government. Organizers don’t especify how much money should be taken out nor what to do with it.
The action targets the five main banks in Catalonia: Caixa Bank, Sabadell, Bankia, BBVA and Santander. Organizers call on clients of Caixa Bank and Sabadell to show their disagreement with the banks’ recent decision to move their headquarters out of Catalonia due to the escalating political crisis between governments in Barcelona and Madrid.
This is the first “direct and peaceful” action organized by Crida per la Democràcia (Call for Democracy). This is an umbrella group which includes among others the two main pro-independence organizations in Catalonia: the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and mnium Cultural.
The mass withdrawal is also aimed at condemning the imprisonment of ANC and mnium presidents, Jordi Sánchez and Jordi Cuixart, held in custody on sedition charges since Monday.
As a reminder, both Banco Sabadell and Caixabank – the two largest banks of the Catalan region – moved their corporate headquarters out of Catalonia (with the help of the Spanish government) shortly after the referendum.
And now it’s time to find out just how solvent (and liquid) the strong Spanish banking system truly is.
The message has now been retweeted or liked over 7,000 times (and remember its past midnight in Spain).",1

"Supercluster of galaxies are interconnected and strung out like pearls, forming glowing ‘filaments’ along the highway, according to scientists.
The intergalactic highway is being drawn in towards a mysterious force called the Great Attractor, emanating from an ‘unknown region’ of the universe.
Astronomers maintain that there are somewhere around 100 and 200 BILLION galaxies in the known universe. That is of course if there is only ONE universe.
In recent years more astronomers are leaning towards the possibility that there are in fact other ‘Universes’ out there, and we are part of a complex system within a ‘Multiverse.’
Researchers have just recently discovered that the Milky Way Galaxy –our very ‘little’ place in the universe— is part of a massive SUPERSTRUCTURE interconnected by over 800 galaxies located at 1000 million light years away.
Astronomers have determined that the Milky Way is in fact part of a supermassive INTERGALACTIC highway –500 million light years across— which contains around 100,000,000,000,000,000 Suns extended through its 100,000 galaxies.
Baptized as Laniakea, this massive supercluster of galaxies is interconnected by a supermassive gravitational flat basin that extends its domain of attraction throughout the supercluster. Think of it as a highway that connects some 100,000 galaxies. All of them move throughout the universe.
This will help researchers translate the speed assigned to the three-dimensional space to get a better understanding of how the cosmos works on a large scale and how superclusters influence our place within the universe.
Interestingly, within Laniakea, galaxies flow inwards towards an ‘unknown region’ called the Great Attractor. This means that the supermassive galactic highway moves together towards this mysterious point in the universe.
The Great Attractor is a mass concentration ten’s of thousands of times that of the Milky Way that has a great influence on the internal movement of clusters contained within Laniakea.
Astronomers have discovered that galaxies in our universe tend to congregate in groups and in supermassive scales, these galaxies are strung out like pearls, forming glowing ‘filaments.’
Astronomers have found that around the supercluster known as Laniakea, there are four neighbouring superclusters respectively called Shapley, Hercules, Coma, and Perseus-Pisces.
Writing in the Journal Nature, researchers who helped map our supercluster said: ‘We define a supercluster to be the volume within such a surface, and so we are defining the extent of our home supercluster, which we call Laniakea.’

The US president and the pentagon have sent 1,000 American soldiers to Kuwait to speed up the fight against the terror group in Iraq and Syria.
This is a large difference to the policy under President Barack Obama’s administration. This signify’s the Trump administrations intent to completely destroy ISIS for good.
“This is about providing options,” said one U. S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The officials said the deployment would differ from the existing U. S. troop presence in Kuwait.
Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said that the order came fromU. S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He also reported that the pentagons plans were strongly supported and signed off by the President.
This is also a different military tactic. As during the Obama administration ground troops were not utilised.Instead they opted to to use helicopters and drones.The difference and significance of the United States deciding to deploy ground troops is that we will now be able to gather valuable insight and information form the ground.
The decision on whether to create a more rapidly deployable Kuwait-based force is part of the ongoing review of the United States’ strategy to defeat Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, where around 6,000 U. S. troops are deployed, largely in advisory roles, the officials said.
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford told an audience at a town hall in February that it would be “a political-military plan.”
“The grievances of the [Syrian] civil war have to be addressed, the safety and humanitarian assistance that needs to be provided to people have to be addressed, and the multiple divergent stakeholders’ views need to be addressed,”

"In the desert climate of Scottsdale, Arizona rest 147 brains and bodies, all frozen in liquid nitrogen with the goal of being revived one day.
It's not science fiction — to some it might not even be science — yet thousands of people around the world have put their trust, lives and fortunes into the promise of cryonics, the practice of preserving a body with antifreeze shortly after death in hopes future medicine might be able to bring the deceased back.
""If you think back half a century or so, if somebody stopped breathing and their heart stopped beating we would've checked them and said they're dead,"" said Max More, CEO of the Scottsdale-based Alcor. ""Our view is that when we call someone dead it's a bit of an arbitrary line. In fact they are in need of a rescue.""
That ""rescue"" begins the moment a medical doctor declares a patient to be dead. It's then that Alcor's team prepares an ice bath and begins administering 16 different medications and variations of anti-freeze, until the patient's temperature drops to near freezing.
""The critical thing is how fast we get to someone and how quickly we start the cooling process,"" he said. In order to ensure that can happen, Alcor stations equipped teams in the UK, Canada, and Germany and offers members a $10,000 incentive to legally die in Scottsdale, where the record for getting a patient cooled down and prepped for an operation is 35 minutes.
Next, a contracted surgeon removes a patient's head if the member selected Alcor's ""Neuro"" option, as it's euphemistically called, in hopes that a new body can be grown with a member's DNA once it comes time to be thawed out. It's also the much cheaper route. At a price tag of $80,000, it's more than half the cost of preserving your whole body. ""That requires a minimum of $200,000, which isn't as much as it sounds, because most people pay with life insurance,"" More said.
Read More from CNBC: Is Cryotherapy the Next Trend in Athlete Recovery?
In fact, that business model is pretty consistent in the non-profit cryonics community. Michigan-based Cryonics Institute offers a similar payment structure, albeit at the more affordable cost of just $28,000 for whole-body preservation. Which begs the question: Why the price discrepancy?
""We've been very conservative in the way we plan the financing,"" More said. ""Of that $200,000, about $115,000 of it goes into the patient care trust fund,"" which is meant to cover eventual costs, and is controlled by a board of trustees (a certain number of whom are required to have loved ones currently in cryopreservation). More says the trust currently boasts a total of over $10 million, which is supported by Alcor's most recent non-profit 990 filings.
When Max More came to the U. S. in 1986 to train at Alcor, it was run by volunteers and he signed up as Alcor's 67th member. Since then, the company has hired a full-time staff of 8 employees, added another thousand members, and is looking into doubling the size of its patient care bay.
And while Alcor said its membership includes some high profile names like billionaire investor Peter Thiel and Google's Chief Engineer Ray Kurzweil, a fraction of the growth in members has come from more modest means.
Elaine Walker, 47, is a single mother and part-time college instructor at Scottsdale Community College who signed up to have her head frozen at Alcor nine years ago after first discovering cryonics in an online newsgroup back in the pre-Google days of the 1990's.
Having just come out of college, she initially saw the cost of Alcor's services as prohibitively expensive, until the company shifted to allow front-funding requirements with life insurance policies. All that was left after $14 a month in life insurance payments was worrying about the nearly $600 in Alcor's annual membership fees, which she covered by canceling her cellphone plan.
""I have a cellphone now, but at the time it's all I had to do,"" she said. Nine years later, she still worries about saving for the eternal future but she's less concerned about what it might look like. ""I actually spend zero time worrying about that,"" she said. ""It's not that I want to be alive again so I can live out some lifetime or do something I didn't get a chance to do. It's really just because I want to see what happens.""
When asked, she said she would even prefer coming back as a cyborg slave laborer on a distant planet to dying on Earth. ""I mean unless it's extremely physically painful or something, and I'll ask the cyborg next to me, 'What happened, did we make it to Mars?'""
In the eyes of the law, Alcor is under no commitment to deliver life after death. In fact, after legal death has been declared, the government views Alcor's 147 ""patients"" as nothing more than bodies and organs donated to science under the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA), which means even though Alcor signs a contract with its members saying it will deliver its cryonics services, it is under loose obligations to do so.
""It would be a very bad idea not to follow through,"" More told CNBC. ""But we're actually very aggressive in following through — we will if necessary go to court to get possession of our patients, or file an injunction to stop an autopsy for instance, and we've done that many times.""
But apart from the legal hurdles of suing those who try to interfere in the handling of a patient, there are laws of science that cryonics must face.
Read More from CNBC: Google Launches New Tool for Digital Afterlife
As Michio Kaku, futurist and professor of theoretical physics at the City College of New York explains: ""When people ask me a scientific question I have to give them results that are testable, that are reproducible, and falsifiable. Unfortunately cryonics offers none of the above."" While advocates of cryonics point to successful in-vitro fertilization of frozen embryos and experiments with simpler animals, Kaku points to the lacking human evidence.
Others note the inherent complexity and lack of current scientific understanding of the human brain. Pointing to the existence of over 100 billion neurons and the minute fraction so far mapped by science, Columbia neuroscientist Dr. Ken Miller likened cryonics to ""selling tickets to a ride you can't go on.""
But in the eyes of Max More, it's not hope Alcor is selling. It's a chance. And to be fair, before cryonics posed these questions, scientific evidence was no more a prerequisite than hope for believing in an afterlife. For members like Elaine Walker and others, that's enough to pay for.
""I want to see the future, so this is what I'm excited about,"" she said. ""The cost is very small considering I have that hope.""",0
"Equifax CEO and Chairman Richard Smith may be gone, but consumer and government criticism and scrutiny of the credit-reporting giant's massive cyberbreach continues to mount.
At least one signof potential new government action against Equifax surfaced within hours of the company's leadership shakeup. Federal Trade Commission responses to questions from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. signaled that the cyberbreach could promptsanctions against the company, which is operating under an FTC consent decree related to improper handling of consumer information.
The federal regulatorsaid it is ""considering whether any FTC order covers the practices at issue and, if so, what remedies may be available. A party that is found to have violated an FTC order may be subject to contempt sanctions and civil penalties.""
* An investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which inJanuary ordered Equifax and TransUnion, two of the three largest U.S. credit-reporting firms, to pay $23.1 million collectively in consumer restitution and fines for deceptions about the usefulness and true cost of credit sold to consumers.
* A lawsuit filed last week by the Massachusetts Attorney General's office that alleges the company knew about electronic vulnerabilities yet failed to protect consumer data. The New York Attorney General's office is conducting a similar investigation.
* First-ever regulations of the company and other credit-reporting firms by the New York Department of Financial Services. The regulations require the companies to meet cybersecurity standards and empower the agency's superintendent to refuse to renew their registrations in some cases.
* Scheduled and expected hearings on Capitol Hill. The proceedingsincludea Tuesday hearing by the House Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection. Smith is expected to testify and answer questions about the cyberbreach.
Most congressional action so far has focused on getting Equifax's explanations of how the cyberbreach occurred, details on electronic safeguards the company had in placeand what the company plans to do besides the offer of free credit monitoring and identity-theft protection.
Rep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon, who chairs the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, acknowledged the possibility of new federal regulations in a recent CNBC interview about Equifax. But he also sounded a cautionary note about over-regulating, citing a need to ""get the facts first, the policy second, but always put the consumer ahead of both.""
Smith, 57, a 12-year Equifaxveteran, bowed out Tuesdayamid the continuing fallout from its Sept. 7 disclosure that hackers executed an electronicattack that compromised personal datafor 143 million Americans— nearly half the U. S. population.
The company said it would delay decisions on his financial benefits and that Smith wouldforgo a 2017 bonus. Equifax board member Mark Feidler was named the company's new non-executive chairman, and italso appointed Paulino do Rego Barrow, a seven-year Equifax veteran who most recently served as president of Asia Pacific, as interim CEO. It said it is searching fora permanent successor.
Smith is the third top executive to leave since the cyberbreach. Equifax announced similarly sudden retirements for its chief information officer and chief security officer this month.
On Tuesday, Equifax said a newly formed special committee of board members is examiningthe company's security precautions and other issues surrounding the cyberbreach that hassent the company's stock price tumbling.
""The board remains deeply concerned about and totally focused on the cybersecurity incident,"" Feidlersaid in a statement issued with theleadership change. ""We are working intensely to support consumers and make the necessary changes to minimize the risk that something like this happens again. Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize.""
The electronic intrusion occurred from mid-May through July 2017 and primarily involved names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some cases, driver's license numbers, Equifax said.
Additionally, the hackers gained access to credit-card numbers for roughly 209,000 consumers, plus certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 consumers.
Equifax also identified unauthorized access to limited personal information for certain residents of theUnited Kingdomand Canada.
Along with the cyberbreach itself, the company has faced widespread criticism of delays, electronic security concerns and other problems with the year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection it offered to consumers.

The company is also dealing with scrutiny of company stock sales made by three executives after the cyberattackbut before the company alerted consumers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., an outspoken Equifax critic, said consumers deserve more than just corporate exits. ""The American public deserves answers about what went wrong at Equifax and what the company plans to do going forward,"" Warren said.
Ratings issued in April by MSCI ESG Research LLC, a New York-based company thatprovides institutional investors with assessments of corporate governance, social and other issues, identified cybersecurity concerns that could be of interest to government regulators and lawmakers.
Equifax received a MSCI score of zero for its privacy and data security rating. Warning that the company is ""vulnerable to data theft and security breaches,"" the rating cited a 2016incident in which salary and tax data for 431,000 employees of the Kroger grocery chain, one of Equifax's major customers, were compromised.
""Equifax shows no evidence of data breach plans or regular audits of its information security policies and systems,"" the rating concluded.
Equifax shares closed up fractionally at $106.95 Thursday. The stock has now lost nearly 26% of its value since the $142.72 a share closing price shortly before Equifax publicly disclosed the cyberbreach.",0
"Kim Jong-un has ordered residents in Pyongyang to evacuate the city immediately amid fears of an imminent nuclear attack in North Korea.
The North Korean leader ordered 600,000 people to “urgently leave” due to a lack of space in Pyongyang’s bomb shelters. The 600,000 residents being asked to leave will mostly consist of individuals with criminal records, according to local news sources.
It was also said that one modified Ohio type rocket carrier carrying 154 Tomahawk type missiles on board joined the US Navy deployed near the coast of the Korean Peninsula. The missile carrier is expected to arrive at the port of registration on April 18.
Meanwhile, according to South Korean media, residents of the DPRK say goodbye to each other, to their homes, to their places of work, to forests and fields, to the sky, rivers, etc as if the nation prepares for a large-scale war. At the same time, it is forbidden to say goodbye to officers of law enforcement agencies. It is also strictly forbidden to mention the names of national leaders in words of farewell.
Chinese social media said a couple of days ago that auxiliary troops and doctors were heading to the border of North Korea. One of the photos showed a chain of military trains moving around Shenyang – a city about 200 miles from the North Korean border.
About 150,000 Chinese soldiers were mobilised in an anticipation of North Korean refugees who may flee the country in the event of an American air strike.
Lieutenant-General H. R. McMaster, in turn, said that his commander-in-chief ordered to deploy an aircraft carrier strike group of the United States in the region. McMaster believes that the decision to deploy US Navy ships in the Sea of Japan was “reasonable,” taking into consideration the North Korean “model of provocative behaviour.”
Noteworthy, China refuted the news about the deployment of 150,000 troops to the border of the DPRK.
Experts believe that tensions may aggravate further after April 15, when the DPRK may conduct another test of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
At the same time, Russia’s well-known Orientalist, Professor Andrei Lankov, who has been living and working in Seoul for many years, said that if the United States attacked North Korea, Pyongyang’s retaliatory strike would pose an immediate threat to the lives of 25 million residents of Seoul as the city sits very close to the border between the North and the South. Another Korean war would be inevitable, the expert believes.",1

"In a growing post-coup purge, Turkey has revoked the licenses of 21,000 teachers in private institutions.
The announcement comes shortly after a report that the High Education Board ordered the resignation of 1,577 deans at all universities across Turkey.
This is the latest in a string of crackdowns on workers who are allegedly linked to the exiled clericFethullah Gulen who has been blamed for last week’s failed coup attempt.
According to an education ministry official, “The licenses of 21,000 teachers working in privately-run institutions have been cancelled. Tip-offs that these [people] are mostly linked with terrorist activities have been taken into consideration”
An earlier report from the state-run Anadolu news agency stated the ministry had dismissed 15,200 education personnel.
Meanwhile, Turkey’s High Education Board has ordered the resignation of 1,577 deans at all universities – both public and private – across the country, state broadcaster TRT reported. The news caused the Turkish lira to weaken beyond 3 to the US dollar.
In addition, 399 employees of the Ministry of Family and Social Polices were stripped of their responsibilities on Tuesday, and 257 people working at the office of the prime minister were also sacked, Anadolu reported.
Turkey’s courts have also ordered that 85 generals and admirals be jailed pending trial over their roles in Friday’s coup attempt. Among those arrested include former air force commander Gen. Akin Ozturk, who is alleged to be a ringleader of the uprising. Gen. Adem Hududi, commander of Turkey’s 2nd Army, which is in charge of countering possible threats from Syria, Iran, and Iraq, was also detained.
Thousands of officials suspected of links to US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen – who the government blames for the coup – have also been purged from the judiciary and Interior Ministry.
The newest sackings and calls for resignation are the latest in a movement that Prime Minister Binali Yildirim says is aimed at removing the influence of Gulen “by its roots.”A total of 49,337public sector workers – including military and police personnel – have lost their jobs since Friday, according to Hurriyet.
President Erdogan and his government blame Gulen for orchestrating the coup attempt on Friday in which over 200 people were killed and 1,400 injured. Ankara has called for Gulen’s extradition from the United States, where he resides in the Pennsylvania town of Saylorsburg.
However, Gulen, 75, has rejected allegations that he was involved in the attempt, telling prosecutors in a statement that he is “not the person who planned or led the coup. Who planned it and directed it I do not know.”
He said that Erdogan may have staged it himself – a claim which the Turkish president has called “nonsensical.”",1
"A TELEVISION advertisement for Monte dei Paschi di Siena begins with a toddler tumbling and a gymnast stumbling. “Falling is the first thing we learn,” declares the voice-over. “The second is getting up again.” Italy’s fourth-biggest bank and the world’s oldest, which was bailed out by the Italian government in July, has had several bruising falls over the years. On October 25th it returned to the stockmarket after a ten-month hiatus—the latest stage of its plan to get back on its feet. The shares closed higher on the day, at 4.55 ($5.37), but still far below the 6.49 the government paid.
Trading was suspended last December, after a failed private-sector attempt to save the bank through a share issue. The government said it would get involved. In July the European Commission approved a 8.1bn “precautionary recapitalisation”. European rules say banks receiving such aid must be solvent, the capital injection must not distort competition and the capital shortfall must be identified by a stress test, such as the one Monte dei Paschi failed in July 2016. Shareholders and junior bondholders must share the pain.
Therefore, alongside the injection of 3.9bn by the government, 4.3bn-worth of subordinated bonds are being converted to equity. Much of this is held by retail investors, many of whom may have thought they were buying a safe investment. Some of these can choose to swap their new shares for senior bonds. The exchange will run from October 30th to November 17th. If, as expected, they all make the swap, the government’s stake will rise from 52% to 68%, at an additional cost of 1.5bn. By 2021 Monte dei Paschi must return to the private sector.
The plan also disposes of 28.6bn-worth, at gross value, of non-performing loans, of which most are being offloaded into a separate vehicle and securitised. Atlante 2, a private bank-rescue fund, will buy most of the mezzanine and junior tranches for 1.6bn; the senior debt will be sold on the market, partly backed by a state-guarantee scheme.
The scheme is rounded off by the bank’s restructuring. This includes simplifying and digitising retail banking, strengthening the wealth-management business and improving credit-risk management. The number of branches will be cut from 2,000 to 1,400; 350 have already closed. Monte dei Paschi’s headcount of 25,500 will be reduced by 5,500; 1,800 staff have already departed.
In August Marco Morelli, the bank’s boss, sent an e-mail to all staff asking for ideas. He received 1,000 replies. He then spent two weeks touring the country, meeting staff in several cities. At each encounter Mr Morelli projected onto a screen three of the most critical e-mailed responses. The message he sought to transmit: no more alibis.
Things may be looking up. Pavilion, an investment services firm, suggests that new regulation and accounting rules will make life harder for Italian banks dealing with bad loans, but cyclical factors will offset this. In August net non-performing loans fell to 65.3bn, down from 86.8bn in December, according to Italy’s banking association. UniCredit, the country’s biggest lender, announced preliminary third-quarter earnings on October 24th: pre-tax profits rose by 45%, year on year, helped by the sale of Pioneer, a fund manager.
But the Sienese lender has a lot of work to do. Its gross non-performing exposure ratio is projected to fall from 34.5% in December 2016 to 12.9% within five years. That is a little below last December’s Italian average, but still much higher than the European average of 5.1%. Meanwhile, new inquiries are under way into two of the bank’s former managers for allegedly obstructing supervisors. Getting up again may be a struggle.",0
"WATCH: Newt Gingrich calls for Seth Rich murder to be investigated on Fox News this morning. pic.twitter.com/ibNrDJeEg0
Seth Rich was a man who wanted the truth and wanted everyone else to know the truth. It seems like every day there are new findings that prove that something shady was involved in his death. Hillary Clinton is a known liar and it seems like the more and more investigating that goes into this case, the more it looks like she is involved. Hillary lost but she is still powerful.
We all know that Hillary would do anything to be on top. That is one reason it is so funny that she lost and she could have easily called for Seth Rich to be killed and the liberals in this country would have done it no problem.
But now we have some help in this matter. Newt Gingrich is known for wanting the truth and he will not back down until he gets it. It has been a while since we had a Republican that would stand up for the issues like this. Gingrich is one of the few Republicans that have stood up for President Donald Trump.
“We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments,” Gingrich explained.
“Nobody’s investigating that, and what does that tell you about what’s going on? Because it turns out, it wasn’t the Russians. It was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee. He’s been killed, and apparently nothing serious has been done to investigative his murder. So I’d like to see how Robert S. Mueller III is going to define what his assignment is.”
What do you think of his comments and do you think something will come of it?",1
"Communist George Soros has his hands in everyone’s politicsin an effort to push his progressive open-borders agenda.
We’re no strangers to “Soros politics,” after all, he’s a staple in the Democrat party and is the person behind the violent anti-Trump protests and BLM riots.
But it’s not just the U. S. where Soros does his dirty deeds.
He backed an “open borders” mayor in Italy, too.
However, the good news is, she’s been booted out of office.
Italians this week cheered the electoral defeat of a mayor who signed a deal with George Soros to turn the tiny island of Lampedusa into a gateway to Europe for migrants travelling from Africa.
“Thank you, you have eradicated the Lampedusa cancer,” read graffiti sprayed across walls on several streets of the small island with just 6,000 residents after voters ousted Mayor Giusi Nicolini.
The Lampedusa native was kicked into third place at local elections Sunday, locals electing businessman Salvatore “Totò” Martello, who said during the campaign that he “cannot stand seeing migrants swarming everywhere”.
Since taking office in 2012 the outgoing mayor transformed the island into a gateway to Europe, streamlining migrant processing to enable Lampedusa’s reception centre to process and give shelter to 700 asylum seekers at a time, moving most of them on to Sicily or the Italian mainland.
Nicolini, who has used her status as a public figure to repeatedly promote open borders and acceptance of mass migration to Europe, was two months ago awarded the UNESCO Peace Prize for her “boundless humanity and unwavering commitment to refugee crisis management and integration”.
And in October last year, the decorated mayor attended dinner with Barack Obama at the White House, brought along by Italy’s then-Prime Minister, the unelected technocrat Matteo Renzi, as one of the people who represented the best of Italy.
Following Nicolini’s defeat, “conservative activists joyfully posted altered images representing the former mayor as an illegal immigrant expelled from the country and memes claiming she is an agent of George Soros,” according to the Washington Post, which described the Hungarian billionaire as “the liberal tycoon whom conspiracy theorists accuse of being behind the wave of African immigration to Europe.”

"Hurricane Irma is a very real, powerful Category 5 storm that lashed the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico's northeast coast and could potentially wallop South Florida this weekend. But the National Weather Service is warning people to watch out for fake forecasts after several went viral on social media.
""Keep your eyes out for fake forecasts. THIS is what an official NOAA advisory looks like. Note: forecast only goes out 5 days,"" the agency said on Facebook. They encouraged readers to visit the National Hurricane Center's official website if you are unsure of the source.
The warning comes after several websites claimed Irma would become a Category 6 storm -- which does not exist -- that would wipe entire U. S. cities off the map.
""There is no such thing as a typhoon in the Atlantic or a Category 6 or higher hurricane,"" WAPT Meteorologist Nathan Scott wrote on Facebook, encouraging users to follow trusted media outlets when searching for information on the storm.
He added, ""Meteorologists have not discussed anything about implementing Category 6 criteria because there's nothing that strong.""
The National Hurricane Center uses the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which grades storms on a scale from 1 to 5 based on sustained wind speeds. Category 5 applies to any hurricane with sustained winds of 157 mph or higher -- powerful enough to cause ""catastrophic damage.""
Another bogus claim was a Facebook post that falsely illustrated the storm on a projected path toward Texas, before any meteorologist knew where the storm would go. The post has since been deleted from Facebook but several meteorologists used this as a lesson to folks looking for information online.
""The fake forecast shows Irma heading southwest of current, real, predictions, and barreling right into Texas, where Harvey, the hurricane-turned-storm, has left record rainfall, devastation and killed dozens,"" meteorologist James Spann of WBMA-TV tweeted.
In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency and activated 100 members of the Florida Air and Army National Guard to help with planning across the state. Another 7,000 National Guard members will report to duty Friday when the storm could be bearing down, though it's too early to know exactly where it may hit.",0
"The Theater That Had A Play With Trump’s Assassination In It Gets A Fresh $100,000 Grant!
The Theater That Had A Play With Trump’s Assassination In It Gets A Fresh $100,000 Grant!
The Public Theater in New York has gotten an astonishing $100,000 grant from the federal government, immediately after the scandal of doing a Julius Caesar production where a Donald Trump character gets assassinated.
Merely days following the scandal with the evident Trump character getting assassinated, the National Endowment for the Arts disclosed its freshest grants. The Public Theater got no less than $100,000 for its New York Shakespeare Festival.
Concretely now, the theater will do performances of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. “Performances will take place outdoors at Central Park’s Delacorte Theater, bringing together a diverse audience with renowned classical performers and young, emerging actors of all backgrounds and experience,” as seen on the June 14 grant announcement.
The NEA refused to confirm that any prior funding was poured into the production of Julius Caesar, however stated, “In the past, the New York Shakespeare Festival has received project-based NEA grants to support performances of Shakespeare in the Park by the Public Theater.”
Even though the government is not staying clear from the theater following the scandal, different corporate sponsors have done so. Bank of America and Delta Airlines withdrew funding after the publishing of the vivid pictures from the play.
“I wonder how much of this ‘art’ is funded by taxpayers?” questioned Donald Trump Jr. via Twitter.
The taxpayer disclosure group OpenTheBooks.com revealed that the New York Shakespeare Festival, which is the parent company of the Public Theater, has gotten almost $30 million in federal, state, and city grants from back in 2009.
Corey Stoll, the actor who played Marcus Brutus, took the play’s side and said that it used a Trump character in a form of “nuanced” art.
The actors and actresses were “exhausted and nervous” and pulled back saddened after the play triggered counter protests from Trump supporters who stopped performances.

"Scalding heat killed at least four people this weekend in Arizona and was stoking at least five major wildfires across the desert Southwest, authorities said Sunday.
Excessive heat warnings blanketed Southern California and Arizona, where temperatures soared into the triple digits Sunday and were expected to remain there until Monday, according to the National Weather Service. ""The interior areas will remain dangerously hot,"" the NWS said.
The heat will remain constant in the West and expand into the middle of the country by midweek, said Reynolds Wolf, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel.
""It's like you take a salt shaker of madness and sprinkle it"" over the western half of the country, Wolf said.
At least four people have died in Arizona from separate heat-related emergencies, authorities said.
The first, a 25-year-old man, died while hiking the Peralta Trail in Pinal County on Saturday, Sheriff Paul Babeu said.
Sunday, a 28-year-old woman who worked as a personal trainer died during a morning hike along the Desert Vista Trail in Maricopa County, Phoenix fire officials told NBC News. The heat overcame her so swiftly that she died despite having taken along plenty of water and being immediately treated by a doctor in her hiking group.
Later Sunday, two hikers, a man and a woman in their early 20s hiking in Pima County left the trail without taking along water and had to be rescued by helicopter, authorities said. The woman died before deputies arrived, and the man was being treated at a hospital, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said Sunday night.
And one man died and another remained unaccounted for Sunday night after their hiking group was overcome in Ventana Canyon near Tucson, the Pima sheriff's office told NBC News. The man who died was believed to be from Germany, but that hadn't been confirmed, the sheriff's office said.
The crushing heat is expected to get even worse Monday, when highs in Phoenix could hit 120 degrees — the hottest in more than 20 years.
New Mexico, southern Nevada, Southern California and other parts of Arizona are expected to see temperatures as much as 20 degrees above average — up to 110 degrees, said Michael Palmer, The Weather Channel's lead meteorologist.
Fire officials said the excessive heat would hamper efforts to quell five explosive wildfires that were forcing evacuations in three states.
In New Mexico, the Dog Head fire, burning about 30 miles south of Albuquerque, had already damaged 24 homes. The fire was only 9 percent contained Sunday, according to incident commander Rich Nieto.
The fire, which started Tuesday, tripled to 17,000 acres Saturday, forcing evacuations. But it hadn't grown much by Sunday, partly because of rising humidity that came with the rising temperatures in the area, Nieto said.
Another fire burning in the state, near Cibola National Forest, had ballooned to more than 35,000 acres Sunday and was 30 percent contained.
""The weather forecast ... calls for unseasonably warm air temperatures along with a drying trend which will continue to develop over the region,"" fire officials said in an incident report. ""This pattern will continue to increase fire behavior and smoke production.""
Heat was also feeding the Sherpa fire in Santa Barbara, California, according to Los Padres National Forest officials.
The more than 2,000 firefighters battling the flames were focused on saving 60 homes in Refugio Canyon and 80 homes in El Capitan Ranch, which were under a severe threat, officials said. Those areas and other surrounding areas were under mandatory evacuation warnings, and officials said Highway 101 could be shut for a second time this week because of the blaze.
Crews were able to make some progress overnight when expected ""sundowner"" winds, which rush down the mountains in 40-mph gusts, didn't materialize. But they will likely strengthen again, meeting low humidity and high temperatures and preventing crews from quelling the fire, which has already burned 7,800 acres.
A new fire broke out about 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET) Sunday along the U. S.-Mexico border near Potrero, California, about 45 miles east of San Diego, and within just a few hours, it had exploded to 1,500 acres, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.
The entire population of Potrero, about 700 people, was being evacuated for what was being called the Border fire on Sunday night, CalFire said.
Winds weren't as much of a concern for crews fighting the Cedar fire in eastern Arizona on Sunday, but the flames would be propelled by heat. ""Over the next 24 hours, fire will continue to spread on the south and east flanks due to burnout operations, resulting in increased smoke and acreage growth,"" an incident report said.
The fire had burned 12,000 acres and was 40 percent contained. Adam Wolfe, the communications manager for the county, told NBC station KPNXof Phoenix that people in the affected city of Show Low should be ready to flee.
""If they have medication, if they have family members, make sure everything that is important can be put in cars and moved,"" he said.",0
"A federal grand jury Thursday indicted two former information technology (IT) aides of Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz — Pakistani-born Imran Awan and his wife Hina Alvi — on four counts of conspiracy in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
The FBI arrested Awan at Dulles International Airport July 24 as he was preparing to board a flight to Pakistan. When his wife Alvi left the U. S. for Pakistan in March, federal authorities found more than $12,000 in cash hidden in a suitcase. She had withdrawn the couple’s three children from local schools and does not intend to return to the U.S., according to the FBI.
“Defendants AWAN and ALVI did unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly conspire, combine, confederate, and agree with each other to commit offenses against the United States,” including bank fraud, false statements, and unlawful monetary transactions, the indictment said.
An arraignment date has not yet been set, and a spokesman for the U. S. Attorney for the District of Columbia did not immediately respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group’s question about when Hina Alvi would become a fugitive if she does not return to the U.S. voluntarily, or whether officials would seek to extradite her from Pakistan.
In addition to lying on multiple mortgage disclosures, as an affidavit alleged at the time of Imran’s arrest, the indictment claims Hina lied by claiming medical hardship in order to withdraw hundreds of thousands of dollars from a retirement program.
The Awans, three of their relatives and a close friend are the targets of an FBI and U. S. Capitol Police criminal investigation into allegations they committed congressional cybersecurity violations and large-scale theft of congressional property in a scheme that may have begun more than a decade ago.
The crew worked as shared IT aides for dozens of House Democrats, including many who were members of the intelligence, foreign affairs and homeland security committees. Most of the Democrats fired them when the Capitol Police investigation became public in February, and their access to the congressional IT system was terminated.
However, Wasserman Schultz kept Alvi on her payroll until March and Awan until the day after his arrest.Authorities arrested Awan on the bank fraud charges in order to take his passport and prevent his leaving the U. S. as the investigation into their Capitol Hill activities continues.
Awan retained Chris Gowen, a longtime aide to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to represent him shortly after his arrest. Gowen has claimed in media interviews that Alvi left the country with the children only because of lost jobs and the high cost of living in the nation’s capitol. Gowen told the Associated Press that the family lives “in squalor” in Pakistan.
Gowen also told The New York Times that the Awans wired series of large sums of U. S. dollars to Pakistan as part of a long-time plan to buy property there.The couple had a combined income of $360,000 a year and owned four properties in the Washington, D.C. area, public records show.
In January, Imran — while impersonating his wife, according to the FBI — wired $283,000 from the Wright Patman Congressional Federal Credit Union.
“The wire transfer specialist asked AWAN for the reason for the wire transfer, and AWAN stated that it was for ‘funeral arrangements,’” the arrest indictment said. “The wire transfer specialist questioned whether ‘funeral arrangements’ was a sufficient reason for such a large transfer.AWAN then changed his reason to ‘purchasing property.’ The wire transfer specialist then initiated the $283,000 wire from the United States to two individuals in Faisalabad, Pakistan.”
Even after Awan’s arrest in July, it is possible more money flowed to Pakistan. On Aug. 3, he sold a home for $617,000, according to public records. Gowen declined to say if the proceeds were wired to Pakistan.
Politico reported that the Awan couple has a “friendly personal relationship” with Wasserman Schultz, who is a Florida Democrat, and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). They are also reportedly close to another Democrat, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York.
Wasserman Schultz resigned from the DNC in July 2016 when Wikileaks released hacked committee emails. She has defended keeping Awan on her payroll even after she was aware he was suspected of, as she described it, “data transfer violations.” She claimed she had “racial and ethnic profiling concerns” and “would do it [keep Awan] again.”
In addition to allegations of fraud and the criminal investigation, other family members have been accused of fraud and worse by Muslim acquaintances and relatives in civil court.
Awan is currently involved in a civil case against his stepmother, Samina Gilani. Awanwanted his stepmother to sign a power of attorney document giving him access to money in Pakistan that was stored in his recently-deceased father’s name. Their stepmother has become homeless while the children — with a combined income of hundreds of thousands per year — are fighting her over a $50,000 life insurance policy.
She claims that Awan used his IT skills to wiretap her and his government connections to intimidate her. Gilani also said Awan told her he had the power to have people kidnapped.
Imran Awan’s brothers Jamal and Abid also were on the House payroll at chief-of-staff level salaries, and Jamal filed a death certificate for his father that falsely said he was divorced. Abid changed the beneficiary of their father’s life insurance policy from the wife to himself after his death, Gilani’s lawyer said.
“Imran Awan threatened that he is very powerful and if I ever call the police again, [he] will … kidnap my family members back in Pakistan,” Gilani claimed in the documents filed in Fairfax County, Va.

"Could the X-Men possibly be real? Let’s start with Professor X. Sure, some people claim to have psychic ability and some have demonstrated pretty staggering proof, so that’s not a stretch. With surgery, could we possible give a person Wolverine claws? Sure. However, it’s doubtful we’ll ever have anyone who can shoot heat rays from their eyes, travel through walls or suck the energy from anyone they touch, not to mention control the weather. However, there have been some real human with reported superpowers, one of whom could give Magneto a run for his money. Here are the people around the world reported to have superpowers.
For a long time, languishing in the backwaters of pseudoscience and the occult, there have been claims about “magnetic” people. On its face, it seems like a preposterous assertion. We have no real reason to believe that people can generate a strong magnetic field which emanates from their bodies. However, when this “power” is demonstrated, it can be convincing, if only for a moment.
Liew Thow Lin is often called the “magnetic man.” Metal objects seem to inexplicably stick to his body. He’s stuck as much as 36 kilograms of metal to his body at once and even pulled a car with his body. Significant testing was done on Lin’s body but no magnetic source was found. His skin was however, found to have an abnormal amount of friction.
After a deep medical study, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) lecturer Nasrul Humaimi Mahmood said this ability was probably associated with “suction properties in his skin.” Professor Dr. Mohamed Amin Alias, from UTM’s electrical engineering faculty in Johor, agreed.

He’s been called a medical mystery, but Daniel Browning Smith just calls himself “Rubber Boy.”
“I can dislocate both arms, both legs, turn my torso 180 degrees and all kinds of crazy stuff,” Smith, 35, told ABC News’ “20/20.”
Smith holds the Guinness World Record for most flexible person and the record for fastest time passing through an unstrung tennis racket three times. He is also a stuntman, breaking his arms and legs in movies, and performs at NBA halftime shows.
The secret to his extraordinary flexibility, Smith said, is a rare medical condition called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).
“It’s a collagen disorder, and it makes me very, very flexible,” said Smith.
The syndrome can cause extreme elasticity of the joints and skin.
“Probably one in 1,000 people have it,” Dr. Michael Holick, a physician at Boston Medical Center and professor of medicine, physiology and biophysics at Boston University School of Medicine, told “20/20.” “Most can show that they are double-jointed so that they could increase mobility of their joints.”

The Native American tribe known as the Tarahumara people are like human panthers. They can run 250 miles per day barefoot across rough terrain and show little to no signs of fatigue. Panther people might not be giving them enough credit as the tarahumara hunt by simply chasing their prey until they collapse of exhaustion.
Tarahumara people or ‘Running people’ are a group of Native American people living in the north-western Mexico who can run 400+ miles in around 50 hours! Sounds impossible, but it is true. Astonishingly, the entire tribe consisting of men, women, old and young, every one of them is capable of running at least 250+ miles in a single run, without shoes. Such extreme feat of endurance has never been seen among humans anywhere else in the world.
They are the kind of people who run to live. They have running events lasting more than 200 miles regularly. They run to send messages and they run for food; Like Michael Stevens fromVsauce says, as hunters humans who can run persistently, can outrun even horses.
The Sherpas of Nepal live at altitudes of over 13,000 feet. Most people would not be able to survive at these altitudes but the sherpas have a genetic mutation that allows them to thrive. The sherpas live with 40 percent less oxygen than most of us and show no side effects.
Sherpas are a Nepalese ethnic group numbering around 150,000. They are renowned for their climbing skills and superior strength and endurance at high altitudes. Perhaps the most famous Sherpa was Tenzing Norgay, who in 1953 was one of the first two men — Edmund Hillary was the other — to climb Mount Everest.
Sherpas act as guides and porters, and do everything from carrying the loads to setting up the camps. They secure climbing routes, fix lines, ferry supplies and guide clients to the top of Everest and other Himalayan peaks.
Al Herpin claimed to have a rare form of insomnia where he didn’t need sleep at all. He claimed to have been awake at one point for over 10 years. Herpin had no bed in his home.

Veronica Seider lives in Germany where she works a dentist. She has the Guinness World Record for identifying the smallest object with the human eye. In college she realized that she can see detail from as far as a mile away. She can identify faces from a mile away even. Most people can’t see detail from 20 feet away. She can also see the content colors in images on a TV set.
Her super human eyesight sounds like something from the plot of a movie.
The normal human eye has a visual acuity of 20/20 while Veronica Seider has an acuity of around 20/2.
She is able to distinguish people from that far away (1 mile) and can also gauge their relative distance from her position.
From some simple mathematics, 1 mile (1.6km) is made of 5280 feet which is really a high level of eyesight detail.
Aside from that, Veronica could also be comparable to a telescope because she claims to see the constituent colors that make up color in color television sets.
Despite possessing all these super human abilities, Veronica Seider pursued her professional dream of being a professional dentist in West Germany.
She wanted to live like a normal human being along with her choice of her profession, and her lifestyle. Because of this she has tried to remain anonymous.

The Moken people, also known as the Sea Gypsies of Asia have pupils that constrict to a mere .08 inch which allows them to see under water in a way that almost no one else can. This allows them to forage for sea cucumbers at depths of 13 feet which is crucial for their survival. They can also hold their breath twice as long as just about anyone else
The Moken are a tribe of around 2,000-3,000 people who live a semi-nomadic lifestyle.
They can be found on the coast and islands in the Andaman Sea on the west coast of Thailand.
The Moken live off the sea’s creatures and plants by using simple tools such as nets and spears to forage for food.
Scientists have discovered that young Moken children have underwater vision that’s twice as good as European children of the same age.
They drew public attention in 2004, when most of them managed to escape the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami that killed more than 250,000 people by relying on their intimate knowledge of the sea.
Natasha Deminka was born in Russia in 1987. At the age of 10 she was able to look inside her mother’s body and see her organs. She was even able to see whether she was having any medical problems.

Many people tested Deminka’s abilities including the Discovery Channel who seemed to verify that she was able to make diagnoses with her sight. However, some skeptics have claimed her abilities are merely educated guesses.

"Murder suspect Robert Durst — who is worth about $100 million, according to the FBI's estimate — is demanding that authorities return $161,000 seized after his arrest.
In court papers filed Thursday, lawyers for the subject of HBO's ""The Jinx"" said the cash ""is not needed as evidence, is not contraband, and is not subject to forfeiture"" and should be returned.
When FBI agents apprehended the real-estate scion at the J. W. Marriott hotel in New Orleans on March 14, they found stacks of hundred-dollar bills totaling more than $44,000. They also found a tracking number for a UPS parcel, which they intercepted; it contained another $117,000. Authorities say they believe Durst, 71, was amassing cash for a life on the run.
Durst was arrested on a murder warrant out of California, where prosecutors have charged him with the 2000 slaying of his confidant, Susan Berman. After the FBI agents found pot and a gun in his hotel room, Durst was also slapped with state drug and weapons charges — and a federal gun charge was added last week. He has pleaded not guilty and his lawyers contend the search was illegal.
At the time of Durst's arrest, HBO was in the midst of airing its documentary series about his bizarre life — including the Berman murder, the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, and the dismemberment of an elderly Texas neighbor whom he claimed to have killed in self-defense.
The finale of the series contained a bombshell: Durst caught on a hot mic seemingly confessing that he had ""killed them all.""",0

“Are we going to face the same thing or are we going to be smart enough to learn from their examples?” he added.
Carson had been asked by Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, to talk about “the need for members of Congress to be honest with our constituents and tell them how urgent it is that we rescue Medicare and Social Security from insolvency.”
Instead, Carson said the debt was the real dragon to be slain.
“Twenty trillion dollars, the national debt, just back it up to $18 trillion. If you tried to pay that off at a rate of $10 million a day, 365 days a year, it would take over 5,000 years,” Carson said.
“This is what we are putting on the back of our citizens,” he said. “Every one of those thousands of babies born today will come with a debt of $60,000 on their head. This does not go away. This is there. So we have to work within that reality. Almost every society had an opportunity to do this.”
The Treasury Department has said that Congress must act before August to raise the debt ceiling, or the federal government will no longer be able to borrow.",1

Executives from the disturbing website Backpage.com are facing indictments for facilitating sex trafficking including child trafficking. All of the executives are top donors to the Democrat party of Colorado.(via WND)
Backpage.com is the purveyor of the sleazy ads that appear in the back of news papers to advertise adult services. The executives of the website are currently being tried in front of a grand jury in Arizona.
The executives have been accused of knowingly accepting advertisements offering sex with minors.
The lawyer for two of the founders of the website acknowledges the guilt of his clients and in a recent court filing that stated that “indictments may issue anytime.”
The court heard how the website developed software that would systematically edit ads appearing in publications. They deleted keywords used in prostitution and child trafficking to “clean up” the ads before publication.
Backpage.com would accept ads from child sex traffickers and would edit the ads for them removing terms such as, “barely legal,” “cheerleader,” and “Lolita.” These are all terms that denote child prostitute in the john community.
Four of the executives of the sex trafficking websites and their wives all donated the maximum amount to the Colorado Senate Victory Fund giving almost $90,000 between them.
This means that the Colorado Democrats accepted money from their largest donors who raised the funds by providing a platform for child and sex trafficking. The knowledge of this deal has caused conservatives in Colorado to demand the party donate the funds to a non-partisan charity to fight child trafficking.
It is unlikely that the Colorado Dems will return the $90,000. Local liberal newspapers are already defending the Backpage.com executives claiming they are not responsible for what third parties place on their website. The liberals take no issue with the website editing the ads to help child pimps slip under the radar of law enforcement.
The Colorado Democrats deserve to be investigated. Who knows how the $90,000 in donations would have affected their policy.
The fact that Democrats are comfortable accepting money raised on child prostitution is sickening, and very telling of the character of those in the party.",1
"As lawmakers continue to investigate Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election, major tech companies sent representatives to Congress to reveal just how much Russian activity was found on their platforms.
General counsels for Facebook, Google and Twitter testified in three different hearings this week as congressional probes into alleged Russian influence in the election continued.
Delegates from tech giants have already met privately with lawmakers on the Hill to discuss ads purchased during the campaign season.
Here’s what you need to know about the tech companies’ involvement.
Last month,Facebook revealedthat it uncovered about $100,000 in ad purchases connected to “inauthentic accounts” that violated its policies. Another $50,000 was found to have been spent on “potentially politically related ad spending” that were in Russian.
Facebook’s Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos said the accounts were “likely operated out of Russia.”
As lawmakers have called for more information about the advertisements, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has promised to make its political advertising more transparent.
Facebook also revealed that content from a Russian group called the Internet Research Agency (IRA) could have reached as many as 126 million users.
President Trumpaccused Facebookof being “always anti-Trump” in a tweet. ButZuckerberg hit backand said “both sides” of the political aisle were upset by content on Facebook – proving “what running a platform for all ideas looks like.”
Twitter representatives previously told lawmakers that it suspended approximately two dozen accounts that were potentially linked to Russia and corresponded to Facebook’s troublesome accounts. Additionally, it said it found 179 related accounts that violated their rules.
Twitter alsorevealed in a blog postthat Russia Today (RT), which it said “has strong links to the Russian government,” spent $274,000 in ads in 2016.
After representatives met with lawmakers, Rep. Mark Warner, D-Va., slammed the information shared from Twitter as being “frankly inadequate on almost every level.” He said Twitter’s explanations of its response was “deeply disappointing.”
Twitteralso announcedthat it has banned ads from RT and Sputnik.
The social media giant said it would use the money already spent on advertisements by RT for research around civic engagement and electoral misinformation.
A Twitter representative told congressional committees that it shuttered nearly 3,000 accounts linked to Russia’s IRA – which is known for spreading pro-Russian government propaganda. That number is nearly 14 times larger than the number of accounts Twitter it handed over to congressional committees three prior.
Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on YouTube, Google Search products and Gmail regarding the 2016 election,Fox Business reported. However, the ads do not appear to be from the same source as those purchased on Facebook.
Accounts connected with the Russian government spent $4,700 on search and display ads and $53,000 was spent on ads with political material that were purchased from either a Russian territory, Russian Internet address or with Russian currency, according to the Associated Press.
""We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,"" Google said in a statement.
Google said this week that it would now verify the identity of all election-related ad buys.
Facebook, Twitter and Google all promised improvements in how they handle advertisements during the hearings.
The House Intelligence Committee unveiled a bevy of fake Facebook ads said to influence American users by Russia. The ads encouraged street demonstrations against both Trump and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and aimed to generate support and opposition for Civil Rights icons, Sen. Bernie Sanders and certain social issues, including LGBT rights.
TECH GIANTS EXECS TESTIFY ON CAPITOL HILL AS PART OF RUSSIA PROBE
At one point during a hearing Tuesday, Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., shook his head after he couldn't get all the companies to commit to not accepting political ads bought with foreign currency. Several ads touting Facebook pages called ""Back the Badge,"" ''Being Patriotic,"" ''Blacktivist,"" ''South United"" and ""Woke Blacks"" were labeled as being paid for in rubles using Qiwi, a Moscow-based payment provider that aims to serve ""the new generation in Russia"" and former Soviet republics, according to the company's website.
Twitter accounts and ads, too, came under fire during the hearings. One Twitter ad – said to have been seen by about 34,000 Trump supporters – said Clinton should be removed from the ballot because of the “dynastic succession of the Clinton family.”
Lawmakers also said some Russia-linked ads, including one from an account purporting to be linked to the Tennessee Republican Party, were shared by members of the Trump campaign and administration, including White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.
The issue over social media’s involvement in the investigation largely stems from advertisements bought from the companies, not necessarily the content shared by users, Dr. Karen North, a clinical professor of communication at the University of Southern California, told Fox News.
But the issue further boils down to what is wrong versus what is illegal. Spreading so-called “fake news” is wrong, but it might not be illegal, the social media expert explained.
“We as users of social media platforms do not want the platforms to be telling us what we can or can’t say – or even that we can’t say falsehoods – because people spin the story of their lives to present a public face to our friends and colleagues,” North said. “We don’t want Facebook or Twitter to tell us we can’t do that.”
North predicted that social media companies will begin to strengthen their regulations – or “dress codes” – for future advertisers.
“There are laws [to protect speech] and then there are rules of conduct, including dress codes at offices or schools,” North said. “Whether or not what’s being done by the Russians or fake news or people lying about adventures in their life, are those illegal or in violation of dress codes?”
Shareholders in the major tech companies have also demanded more transparency regarding foreign involvement that could have interfered in the election.
“Like Congress and the American public, shareholders in these companies have serious questions and concerns about how these platforms were used and abused during the 2016 election,” Michael Connor, executive director of the nonprofit Open MIC, said in a statement.
Open MIC said shareholders with assets worth more than $25 billion have filed proposals asking Facebook, Google and Twitter to divulge more information about foreign involvement as well as disinformation and hate speech.
“The investors, through these filings, intend to play a critically important role in holding Facebook, Google and Twitter accountable for what happens on their platforms,” Connor said.
A bipartisan group of senators introduced in October legislation that would regulate advertisements purchased for online platforms. The legislation is aimed at hitting “archaic laws” that allow content and purchasers of advertisements to be hidden from the public, according to a Senate aide who helped draft the Honest Ads Act backed by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn; Mark Warner, D-Va.; and John McCain, R-Ariz.
“Online political advertising represents an enormous marketplace, and today there is almost no transparency,” Warner said in a statement. “The Russians realized this, and took advantage in 2016 to spread disinformation and misinformation in an organized effort to divide and distract us.”
In his own statement, McCain contended that current transparency laws dealing with political campaigns “have not kept pace with rapid advances in technology, allowing our adversaries to take advantage of these loopholes to influence millions of American voters with impunity.”
The legislation would require certain digital platforms to keep a public file of all electioneering communications purchased by a person or group totaling more than $500 total on ads.
It also requires online platforms “to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that foreign individuals and entities are not purchasing political advertisements in order to influence” Americans.

"Kamala Harris was grandstanding again as she tried to bully Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Capitol Hill. Sessions, with his smooth southern drawl, outsmarted and outclassed Harris, who came off as a screaming shrew, and it’s no wonder with her tawdry past. Harris has a dirty little sex secret that is coming back to haunt her, but that’s not all. She has a long line of corrupt deals, one with Maxine Waters, that helped her get power and stay in power.
If there ever was a swamp creature in Washington, D. C., it is Kamala Harris. In fact, she is the poster politician for all swamp creatures. Harris has been trying to make a name for herself by screaming and bullying two of the good guys left in D.C., Admiral Mike Rogers and Jeff Sessions. Well, the junior senator from California didn’t come out unscathed, as her dirty little sex secret has come out.
Harris got her start in 1994 by having an affair with slimy Willie Brown, who was serving as the California Assembly Speaker and then became the mayor of San Fransico. Brown was 60 years old and Harris was 29 when their affair began. Harris was so brazen that she came out publicly as his date at his 60th birthday party, despite his wife of 36 years being in attendance.
Says the woman who began her political career as Willie Brown's mistress.
Harris slept with Brown for one reason; she used the corrupt San Francisco mayor to launch her rise to power. Daily Caller reports, “As Brown’s time as speaker drew to a close in 1994, he named Harris to the California Medical Assistance Commission, a job that came with a $72,000 annual salary. Brown had previously appointed her to the state Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board.”
She “was described by several people at the Capitol as Brown’s girlfriend,” the Los Angeles Times reported at the time. Although that job paid nearly $98,000, Harris’ term was set to expire in five weeks when Brown tapped her for the Medical Assistance Commission slot. That body met only monthly, and the $72,000 position was not considered a full-time job.
#KamalaHarris is a disappointment & a grandstanding fraud. She doesn't want answers, she wants to make a name for herself. #SessionsHearing pic.twitter.com/0o9cyPykYz
Willie Brown is a sleaze-bag who led one of the most corrupt mayoral offices ever seen in San Fransico, but that was fine with Harris, who went on to steal the election for California’s Attorney General in 2010. “Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley led Harris by 34,000 votes after more than 7 million were counted. But after provisional ballots were counted, she was declared the winner by approximately 50,000 votes,” reports Daily Caller.
At one point, Cooley was up by 62,000 votes, and in panic mode, Harris reached out to her good buddy California Secretary of State Debra Bowen, whose role was to certify the votes. That’s when thousands of Cooley’s votes just disappeared.
Lol. Kamala Harris. Corrupt Willie Brown's ex-GF. He ""helped"" her up the ranks. Shady 2010 election result.
Kamala Harris’ path to power is strewn with illicit affairs and fraudulent elections, and in desperation, she paid Maxine Waters’ daughter Karen $63,000 dollars to appear on mailers with Auntie Maxine. Washington Free Beacon reports, “The payments were made from Harris’s campaign committee and transferred to Waters’s campaign committee through a lucrative ‘slate mailer’ operation run by Waters’s daughter, a program that has proved profitable for both her daughter and the campaign.”
Liberal loons are grasping at straws on social media, hailing Harris as the savior they need, and anyone who questions their new “it” girl gets called a racist and a misogynist. Harris is nothing that any little girl should aspire to be; she is just another swamp creature who got there by having sex with a 60-year-old buffoon.
But, the biggest travesty is this D. C. swamp creature questioning an honorable man like Jeff Sessions; she isn’t fit to carry his shoes, let alone question his patriotism. She wouldn’t know patriotism if it hit her in the face, so we say bring it on in 2020 as the liberals call for Harris to run against Donald Trump. We’d love to see the president come up with her nickname. If you thought Crooked Hillary was good, you haven’t seen anything yet.

"Set to become the world’s largest seed technology company, if it is successful in acquiring Monsanto– Bayer’s Adrian Percy, a global head of Research and Development with Bayer, has publicly bemoaned the fact that consumers in Europe are staunchly resisting genetic engineering and even stated that he believes that the battle over GMOs in Europe is over.
“To be honest,” he said. “I think that battle is probably lost.”
Percy says that countries like France and Germany are simply not going to budge when it comes to GMOs and that there is no point in fighting it. But that doesn’t mean that Percy, Monsanto or Bayer are actually giving up. In fact, they’re simply gearing up for a new fight, this time, with more “educated” “scientists,” “farmers” and “consumers.”
The company is planning to push for a new form of genetic engineering known as gene editing. And this time, the corporation wants consumers pacified before the fight even starts.
Percy said he believes it’s critical that the scientific community get behind gene editing and other forms of genetic engineering and take the lead in advocating for the technologies to be used in Europe. There is little doubt, of course, that the legions of scientists who are getting paid by GMO seed companies to find positive results in their experiments…oops, I mean, (*Ahem) objective results.
This is despite the fact that the last time scientists and Bayer went on a propaganda spree in Europe, it ended with the deaths of millions of people in concentration camps in the second World War. But what is a few million people gassed to death between friends, eh?
But speaking of propaganda and indoctrination, it should be noted that Percy himself was speaking at the “Agvocacy” forum in San Antonia when he made his remarks.
“The debate in Europe,” he said. “Is going to be a difficult one because people are entrenched at this point.”
But Bayer is doing its best to ensure that Europeans do not retain their ability to think for themselves for very long. In fact, over a thousand farmers have already gone through Bayer’s 4-hour agvocacy re-education, er, training program. And 10,000 growers have already pledged to join Bayer and become “agvocates.”
The program is designed to equip the farmers “with facts about biotechnology and chemicals and how to engage with consumers through social media.”
In other words, we should soon expect an army of SJW farmers who become emotionally unhinged and personally insulted that you the consumer don’t want to eat the toxic crap they sold out to big corporations to produce.
Indeed, any grad student with a pot plant is likely to be considered a grower and will take to the interwebs to launch volleys of insults at soccer moms, hippies and foodies for daring to form their own opinions without a prescription from a PhD. Likewise, Bayer is working with its own CropScience division which contains 5,000 scientists to “help educate the public.”
Something tells me that out of the 5,000 scientists, there will be no dissenters. Obviously, it’s because the science is so rock solid…
Clearly it has nothing to do with their paychecks.
To make matters more irritating, Bayer has apparently taken cues from McDonald’s in terms of naming its programs. What’s next, will farmers become agfarmers and consumers become part of the Bayer community by being agsumers? Perhaps Bayer’s new technology will be neither genetic engineering nor gene editing. Instead, Europe may get to see genetic ag-genering and ag-editing.Truly we expected better from what is set to become one of the largest corporations on the face of the earth.
Chief Technology Officer with Monsanto, Robert Fraley, has stated, “Certainly, if there’s anything that we’ve learned from our experience with GMOs, is we know that good science by itself is not enough. It has to be accompanied by great communication and a transparent relationship with the public.”
By great communication, Fraley really means good propaganda. And by good science, he means bought scientists. As for a transparent relationship with the public, we can only assume Fraley means the above quote where he publicly stated that he is going to help propagandize the public to promote his product.

"It was the greatest show on Earth. The sun and the moon put on a celestial performance -- for an audience of hundreds of millions. It was a matinee that saw the moon upstage the sun, bringing darkness to daytime.
The sun was completely blocked for a couple of minutes in a band 70 miles wide that stretched across 14 states, from Oregon to South Carolina. It was the first coast-to-coast total eclipse in 99 years, and, for many Americans, a once-in-a-lifetime chance to witness -- and celebrate -- a wonder of the universe.
Two-hundred million Americans live within the ""path of partial eclipse or totality,"" and many hit the road to witness the laws of nature go topsy-turvy. For one afternoon, millions of people looked up at the sky rather than down at their phones, as CBS News' Mark Strassmann reports from Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.
* Why you won't need to wait 99 years for the next solar eclipse
Satellite imagery showed the trajectory's sweep. From the Pacific Northwest, the eclipse raced 2,500 miles across America's heartland in roughly 90 minutes.
It was just as riveting from 30,000 feet -- in an airplane, Strassmann reports.
And people everywhere tried to preserve the rare moment, using their protective glasses to take photos on their smart phones and post them on social media, which exploded in wonder.
The Charleston Harbor Resort and Marina threw an eclipse beach party for 2,000 people and there was a flotilla offshore. When totality arrived, the clouds parted just in time for Janelle and Will Alexis.
""That's the word: humbling,"" the couple told Strassmann.
In Carbondale, Illinois, tens of thousands went to Southern Illinois University to watch the total eclipse. Some were there for the fun, while others went for the science, CBS News' Adriana Diaz reports.
Totality was a golden opportunity for NASA scientists like Lou Gallo.
""This is game day,"" Gallo said. ""This is like the Super Bowl of eclipses.""
NASA scientists gave Super Bowl-worthy roars as the U. S. caught its first eclipse glimpse in Oregon. Because of the potential for data collection, NASA covered it like the big game -- aiming 14 satellites, flying 10 airplanes, launching upwards of 70 balloons and deploying data-collecting telescopes along the path, including a trailer-sized mobile telescope.
The eclipse does more than turn day into a 360-degree sunset, said Michelle Nichols of Chicago's Adler Planetarium. It brings scientists closer to unlocking the mysteries of the sun that we depend on for life.
""The temperature of the bright part of the sun that we can see, it's about 11,000 degrees, temperature of the corona, several million degrees,"" Nichols said. ""What's going on to cause that? We don't know. So when the moon covers the sun, we get to study that part of the corona.""
""We're explorers,"" Gallo told CBS News. ""It's in our genes, so we explore the universe.""
Even though Carbondale only got a shot at totality for 10 seconds, NASA scientists told Adriana Diaz that they were able to collect valuable data in the short time, and that data will be added to information gathered nationally.
CBS News' Jamie Yuccas spent the afternoon in Madras, Oregon, which has a population of 7,000 and was one of the first places in America to watch day turn into night. One-hundred thousand stargazers surged into the city, and when the magic moment arrived -- totality -- people across the country gaped in wonder.
It happened at exactly 10:19 a.m. and lasted precisely 2 minutes and 2 seconds.
""The light got so weird. And it was like, the world never looks like this,"" eclipse watcher Rebecca Boyd told Yuccas.
The town of 6,200 estimates it packed in 100,000 spectators, including Mona Thompson.
""I totally cried … I don't know why,"" Thompson said. ""It was just so awesome.""
Carl Brown came to celebrate his 92nd birthday and agreed it was a once-in-a-lifetime event -- at least for him.
Others, old and young, cheered the celestial event. Among them were Chris and Eli White.
""We all came for the same reason and we kind of became a small community and I love that,"" Chris said.
People traveled to Madras from 30 countries and every one of the 50 states. Once the sun's party ended, many jumped in their cars to head home.
Some people at an Oregon campsite packed up before the eclipse even started. The line to get out was hours long, Yuccas reports. Some said they'll just stay until Wednesday so they don't have to get in a traffic jam.
Over in Nashville, Tennessee, CBS News' David Begnaud was in Music City, which celebrated the eclipse with a twang: Thousands gathered in front of the Grand Ole Opry.
Nashville was the largest city in the path of totality and one that knows how to throw a party -- even a star party. When the moon swallowed the sun, the skies went dark and the glasses came off.
At the local zoo, many animals didn't know what to do. Giraffes were clearly confused by nightfall at midday.
And then there was Gary Parkerson, who edits an astronomy magazine. He spent 15 months biking the entire route of totality to promote the event, even missing the birth of his granddaughter. For him, Monday meant everything.
""You know I didn't sleep at all last night, I was too excited so I'm exhausted, I'm exhilarated, I want this to last as long as possible,"" Parkerson said.
But, as the moment of totality finally approached, so did a large cloud. Parkerson's moment in the sun was ruined, but not his spirit.
""I wish I had seen totality but I got to see so much more. I got to see so many people,"" Parkerson said.",0
"A senior commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces has called for the immediate withdrawal of US forces from Iraq after the elimination of ISIS terrorists.
Qais al-Khazali, head of the Iranian-funded Hashd al-Sha’abi tweeted on Monday night that US troops who are currently in Iraq as part of the coalition against ISIS, must prepare to go home.
To the US Secretary of State: your armed forces have to prepare from this point immediately and without any delay to leave our homeland Iraq after the end of the ISIS-presence excuse” Khazali’s tweet said in Arabic.
The statement came after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a Sunday joint press conference with his Saudi counterpart Adel al-Jubeir in Riyadh that Iran and all other countries currently helping Iraq in its fight against the Daesh terrorist group needed to leave the Arab country now that the battle was drawing to a close.
A day later, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s media office criticized Tillerson’s meddlesome comments, saying, “No party has the right to interfere in Iraqi matters.”
Hashd al-Sha’abi is an Iraqi state-sponsored umbrella organization composed of some 40 groups, which are mainly Shia Muslims. The force reportedly numbers more than 100,000 fighters. Iraqi authorities say there are between 25,000 and 30,000 Sunni tribal fighters within its ranks in addition to Kurdish Izadi and Christian units.
The fighters have played a major role in the liberation of Daesh-held areas to the south, northeast and north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, ever since the terrorists launched an offensive in the country in June 2014.
Iran has been providing advisory military assistance to the central government in Baghdad and the regional government in the Iraqi Kurdistan, helping them both maintain ground and win back territory lost to the terrorist group in 2014.
On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also slammed Tillerson’s remarks, saying they had been uttered under the influence of petrodollars of certain states.
“Exactly what country is it that Iraqis, who rose up to defend their homes against ISIS, return to?” Zarif said in a tweet late on Sunday, using an alternative name for Daesh. “Shameful US FP (foreign policy), dictated by petrodollars,” he tweeted.",1
"They’re known as MS-13, MS, Mara or Mara Salvatrucha, but by any name, they’re trouble.
MS-13 is a Central American gang founded in Los Angeles in the 1980s by Salvadoran immigrants. While still heavily represented in California, they have spread across the nation—into at least 42 states and Washington, D. C.-- and beyond, especially into Central America.
It’s estimated there are more than 10,000 members in the U. S., and over 30,000 worldwide.
Many gang members can be recognized by elaborate tattoos and special hand signals they use, but it’s their criminal activities and tremendous violence that have got the attention of the FBI and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). They are known for using machetes to hack some of their victims.
One anonymous member of the gang, who has since gone straight after spending time behind bars, explained the group’s appeal in an interview with News 12 Long Island.
""The lure in the beginning is to 'raise your flag up,'"" he said. ""If you're Salvadorian, no one is going to mess with you, no one is going to mess with your friends.""
In the interview, the former gang member said if a sense of belonging and the availability of girls wasn't enough, the gang had other ways of sealing the deal with new recruits at meetings.
“Once you're there, you immediately feel like if you don't join that day, they're going to turn on you,"" he told News 12 Long Island.
The 30-second initiation beating he described in the interview foreshadowed the gang's philosophy toward outsiders: ""Go extreme, extreme, extreme,"" he said of the gang's mentality. ""Make it so people are petrified of you.""
Indeed, the gang’s motto has been “kill, rape, control.” For years, MS-13 has been involved in drug, weapons and human trafficking, and have left behind a long trail of victims.
Here are just a few of the most recent cases authorities tied to MS-13:
-- One man met his killers in the woods in Maryland, where they’d already dug his grave.
-- Another man was ambushed and killed under a bridge in the Capital Beltway, stabbed and hit with rocks as he tried to crawl into a stream.
-- Four Hispanic men in Long Island were brutally murdered and mutilated in an incident tied to MS-13.
Then there’s the murder of 17-year-old Raymond Wood in Bedford, Va. His body was found mutilated, and three MS-13 members (all illegal aliens) have been charged with the crime.
His uncle, Dale Wood, told WLNI his nephew's hands were chopped off and his throat cut. He was stabbed 16 times and run over twice, the grieving man said.
The gang is so ferocious and so feared that, in El Salvador—where President Salvador Sanchez Ceren claims there’s “nearly a murder an hour” — MS-13 members are essentially allowed to run the prisons in which they’re incarcerated.",0
"Yesterday New Jersey voters elected a governor who wants to legalize marijuana, while Virginia voters elected a governor who wants to eliminate criminal penalties for simple possession.
Incoming New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who defeated Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, will succeed Republican Chris Christie, who as a candidate for his party’s 2016 presidential nomination threatened to crack down on marijuana in states that have legalized it. Murphy, by contrast, thinks New Jersey should join that list. “The criminalization of marijuana has only served to clog our courts and cloud people’s futures, so we will legalize marijuana,” he said after winning the Democratic primary in June. “And while there are financial benefits, this is overwhelmingly about doing what is right and just.” His campaign website promised to “legalize marijuana so police can focus resources on violent crimes.”
Marijuana Majority founder Tom Angell notes that New Jersey Senate President Stephen Sweeney, a Democrat, has said he is “committed” to considering a legalization bill in early 2018. “New Jersey is poised to potentially become the first state to allow legal recreational marijuana sales with an act of its legislature, as opposed to by voters through a ballot measure,” Angell writes. Last summer, state Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Linden), who introduced a legalization bill in May, told The New York Times, “Given [Murphy's] support and the leadership of the house, I think we have obviously a legitimate opportunity to do this in the first 100 days of the Murphy administration for an outright cannabis law done legislatively.”
New Jersey legalized medical marijuana in 2010, although Christie initially resisted implementation of the bill and the state’s program remains one of the country’s most restrictive. If you are not a registered patient and are caught with 50 grams or less of marijuana, you face a maximum fine of $1,000 and up to six months in jail. Above that threshold, the maximum penalty for possession is a $25,000 fine and 18 months in jail. During his campign, Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive who has never held elective office, noted that New Jersey police make some 24,000 low-level marijuana arrests each year, that blacks are three times as likely as whites to be arrested, and that enforcing pot prohibition costs the state $143 million a year.
Incoming Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat who is currently the state’s lieutenant governor, defeated former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie. Like Murphy, he cited the racially disproportionate impact of marijuana arrests, arguing that decriminalization would address that problem.
“We need to change sentencing laws that disproportionately hurt people of color,” Northam wrote on Medium in February. “One of the best ways to do this is to decriminalize marijuana. African Americans are 2.8 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession in Virginia. The Commonwealth spends more than $67 million on marijuana enforcement—money that could be better spent on rehabilitation.”
Northam added that “as a doctor, I’m becoming increasingly convinced by the data showing potential health benefits of marijuana, such as pain relief, drug-resistant epilepsy, and treatment for PTSD.” If marijuana is decriminalized, he argued, “our researchers can better study the plant so doctors can more effectively prescribe drugs made from it.”
Virginia has no medical marijuana program and treats possession of less than half an ounce as a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine and up to 30 days in jail for a first offense. Those penalties rise to $2,500 and a year for subsequent offenses. Tommy Norment, the Republican majority leader of the Virginia Senate, recently said he plans to introduce a bill that would make a first-time possession of marijuana, which leads to more than 12,000 arrests in Virginia each year, a civil offense punishable by a fine, mandatory education, and suspension of driving privileges.",1
"In March last year, U. K. Prime Minister David Cameron stood on the assembly line at the Vauxhall Motors car plant in Ellesmere Port near Liverpool and warned that the factory was exactly the kind of success story that could be killed off by a vote to leave the European Union.
Less than 12 months on, Cameron is out of a job, his successor Theresa May is preparing a complete split from the EU and Vauxhall’s future is uncertain as owner General Motors Co. mulls the sale of its unprofitable European arm to France’s Peugeot -- a move that may have been triggered by the Brexit vote.
With German politicians already lobbying to protect jobs at Vauxhall’s sister brand Opel and Peugeot parent PSA Group, part-owned by the French state, unlikely to favor cuts at its plants, a post-sale savings push would inevitably put the U. K. business under pressure even without the EU schism. The consequences of a so-called “hard Brexit” may leave it even more vulnerable.
At stake is a near 115-year-old business that ranks as Britain’s No. 2 car brand with 10 percent of the market and employs 4,500 people, as well as supporting 17,000 jobs in its supply chain and 20,000 at sales outlets. May’s government has already taken steps to assure Nissan Motor Co., owner of the U. K.’s biggest vehicle factory, of its commitment to supporting auto-making, and could face a tougher task in winning over Peugeot should a deal go ahead -- though former business secretary Vince Cable warned that piecemeal deals should be avoided.
“Opel has a huge problem with its plants not being fully utilized,” said Thomas Goettle, head of automotive at PA Consulting in Frankfurt. “They’re probably hammering out a deal that’s in favor of Germany and France, so I don’t see the brightest future for the U. K.” Either Ellesmere Port or Vauxhall’s second plant at Luton, north of London, could close, he said.
While the Astra model built at Ellesmere Port, which has almost 2,000 workers, has been one of Britain’s best-sellers for 3 1/2 decades, 85 percent of the site’s annual output of about 120,000 autos goes for export to mainland Europe. Those cars could face sales taxes equal to 10 percent of their price on entering the EU if May favors immigration controls over landing a comprehensive trade deal and commerce with Europe is subject to World Trade Organization tariffs.
At the same time, only 25 percent of the Astra’s components are sourced in Britain.In a scenario where WTO rules were in place, remaining parts would most likely incur charges averaging 4.5 percent each time they crossed the EU border, something that can happen several times over in the manufacture of complex automotive assemblies such as transmissions and engines.
Ellesmere Port may be particularly at risk when the current Astra comes up for replacement in 2021, analysts at LMC Automotive said in a note, adding that the model could be consolidated with the next Peugeot 308 platform.
For the Vivaro medium-sized van, made at the Luton plant, which employs 1,500 people, the figures are almost as stark, with 66 percent of the 73,000 units built in 2016 going for export and 60 percent of the vehicle’s parts made outside the U. K. Complicating matters, the model is produced as part of a joint venture with Renault SA.
Brexit has already cost GM $300 million following the pound’s slump in the wake of the June 23 vote, with Vauxhall paying more for parts sourced abroad and Opel gaining less revenue from the export to Britain of more than 200,000 autos built on the continent when translated into euros. Customers also shied away from purchases when prices were raised to help compensate for the currency changes. That in turn pushed the unit to a $257 million loss, when it would otherwise have posted the first profit since the late 1990s.
Retaining Vauxhall in the event of an Opel takeover would also give Peugeot five brands, including the French company’s Citroen unit and its DS premium marque, each with its own marketing, advertising and administrative costs. Peugeot has made autos in the U. K. in the past, acquiring the Talbot division from Chrysler in 1978 before abolishing the brand in favor of producing own-name cars, and eventually exiting production completely in 2006 with the loss of 2,300 jobs at the Coventry plant.
Most concerning for Vauxhall workers may be the production overlap on the Astra. While Ellesmere Port makes the hatchback and sports tourer variants, the model is also assembled at Opel’s Gliwice factory in Poland. Auto labor costs average 25.83 euros an hour per employee in the U. K. versus 9 euros in the East European country, according to the VDA German industry association.
Still, Germany itself, where Opel has major plants atits Russelsheim base near Frankfurt and Eisenach in the east has costs that are far higher at 52.53 euros an hour, and last time Vauxhall faced off against its sister business it was Ellesmere Port that survived and a plant at Bochum in the Ruhr that GM closed.
Even Spain, where the automaker builds cars in Zaragoza, is only marginally cheaper than Britain, at 25.71 euros an hour, the VDA says. France, where Peugeot has five main factories, ranks second-most expensive at 41.02 euros.
Also counting in Vauxhall’s favor may be the positives of having production in a sterling economy as a hedge against variations in the value of the euro. In that respect, Peugeot could benefit from having a U. K. presence, Dominic O’Brien, an autos analyst at Exane BNP Paribas told Bloomberg. It’s also possible that Ellesmere Port could realign its production to more directly serve the U.K. market and avoid the bulk of the tariff burden.
PSA and GM are discussing numerous strategic initiatives, including a possible Opel deal, the companies said after Bloomberg reported the talks Tuesday. The U. S. manufacturer is seeking a multi-billion dollar amount for Opel and Vauxhall, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Ex-business secretary Cable, a Liberal Democrat who served in Conservative Cameron’s coalition government, said May should resist getting drawn into a succession of settlements and needs to address fundamental concerns about Britain leaving the EU customs union.
“This isn’t something you can deal with by buying them off one by one,” he said in an interview, adding that all U. K. carmakers are vulnerable to Brexit “to a varying degree” because of their reliance onimporting parts and exporting finished cars, suggesting Jaguar Land Rover is least exposed because of the strength of its sales to the U.S. and other non-European markets.
Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, Britain’s leading trade union, told Bloomberg Television that Vauxhall was too vital a part of the U. K.’s manufacturing base to become a victim of theBrexit fallout and international consolidation, calling on May to provide similar assurances to those offered regarding Nissan’s mammoth Sunderland site, and to engage with General Motors and counter the influence of the French and German governments.
While it’s not clear if the Brexit vote pushed GM to seek a European withdrawal it last considered after the financial crash before opting to keep Opel in 2009, many companies are unsure about the future, McCluskey said. At the same time, firms must not use the poll “as an excuse to attack our jobs,” he added.
U. K. car production hit a 17-year high in 2016, surging 8.5 percent to 1.7 million autos, making the country Europe’s No. 3 manufacturer, according to theSociety for Motor Manufacturers and Traders industry group. Exports reached a record, with more almost 80 of percent of vehicles shipped overseas. Britain is also the region’s second-biggest auto market.
“Automotive has been the shining light in a pretty bleak period over the past eight or 10 years,” McCluskey said. “We’ve got no intentions of allowing a single job loss as a result of anything that might happen in the discussions between GM and Peugeot.”",0

House Republican leaders on Nov. 2 proposed legislation that would overhaul the U. S. tax code. Here's what you need to know about it. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)    House Speaker Paul D. Ryan spoke often Thursday (andtweeted) about how a typical family of four that makes $59,000 a year would get a $1,182 tax cut, but that's only in the first year. There are already serious doubts about how much the middle class benefits from the GOP plan — and for how long. Ryan'scorrect that $59,000 is smack dab in the middle of the income spectrum. It's the median income in the United States, meaning half of households make more in a year and half make less. He's also right that this family would pay $1,182 less than they paid in 2017. But that model family would get a tax hike by 2024, according to ananalysis by David Kamin, a tax law professor at New York University. It's “totally absurd,” Kamin says. “The tax cuts for the middle class are all front loaded.” One of the key provisions in the GOP tax bill to help middle class families is a new Family Flexibility Credit of $300 for each tax filer and another $300 for a spouse. But that credit expires after five years, making the math for the middle class A lot less rosy. In 2023, the year the tax credit would go away, the $59,000 family would barely get any tax reduction at all, and by 2024, therewould be an increase, Kamin found.  When The Washington Post asked Ryan's office about this, they deferred to the House Ways and Means Committee. A spokeswoman there sent over the breakdown for how the $59,000 family gets a tax cut in the first year, but not what happens in the following years. There are trade-offs in any tax bill. As the Ways and Means Committee worked late into the night to finalize its plan, the members made a last-minute decision to help big businesses at the expense of the middle class, by making a major change to theFamily Flexibility Credit.According to a person familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, Republicans expect the tax break for the middle class will be extended, although it's not clear right now how that would happen. If Republicans help the middle class more, they either have to scale back business tax cuts or add even more to the debt. The package already adds $1.5 trillion to America's debt over the next decade. Adding any morewould run afoul of the process Republicans hope to use to get the bill through the Senate with a simple majority — something critical to its chances of passagebecause of broad Democratic opposition. Kamin's analysis is just for one family making $59,000 a year. Later today, the Joint Committee on Taxation is expected to release a report detailing what happens to families across the income spectrum under this tax plan. JCT is a nonpartisan group that is the official scorekeeper onhow much congressional tax bills cost and who wins and loses. Early estimates predict that a sizable number of middle class families will see a tax increase under this plan. The New York Times estimatedthat 13 million people makingless than $100,000 would see a tax increase under the GOP bill, based on an open-source model called TaxBrain. Ernie Tedeschi, an economist who served in President Barack Obama's Treasury Department, predictedthat 25 millionfamilies would facehigher taxes in 2018 under the plan and 47 million by 2027. Another issue Kamin found is that the Family Flexibility Credit and the expanded Child Tax Credit ($1,600 a year per child instead of $1,000 per child now) are not indexed to inflation, meaning the amount of the deduction does not go up over time even as the things families would want to buy with that credit do. These credits are supposed to replace the current personal exemption, which is indexed to inflation. Almost every bill gets changed between the time it is introduced and the final vote. Since middle-class tax relief is a core promise of Trump's, Republicans are likely to revisit this if the JCT official assessment shows a higher number of families would be worse off under the bill. “We also have another bright line test as we need to deliver middle class, middle income, hard-working families — we need to deliver them a tax cut. Those are the two areas where the president won’t budge. Everything else, we’re pretty flexible on,” Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic adviser, told Fox Business on Friday. The Senate is also still crafting its own version of the tax plan. Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said Friday that if he had his way, the family credits “would all be permanent.” “We're going to have to make some tough decisions about what can be permanent and what has to expire,” Toomey said.

"The move will also see Naked Wines founder, Rowan Gormley, taking over as chief executive of the overall company. Majestic's previous chief executive, Steve Lewis, left the post in February.
Majestic said the 70m deal would combine Naked Wines' online and e-commerce skills and Majestic's national store network.
It also said trading in March was weak. Its shares fell 6% in early business.
Rowan Gormley has founded a number of high-profile businesses. As well as Naked Wines, which started business in 2008, he was also behind the launch of Virgin Wines, the Virgin ONE Account and Virgin Money.
Majestic also plans to expand further in the US and Australia.
The two will continue to operate as independent brands.
Kate Calvert, analyst at Investec, said the takeover was a good move: ""Both businesses have much to gain from each other. We expect Mr Gormley to look to unlock Majestic's online potential.""
Naked Wines acts as a form of wine club and is a prolific user of social media on which its customers and wine producers are encouraged to communicate.
It has more than 300,000 customers, compared with Majestic's 640,000.
Majestic said same store-sales had risen by 1.5% since Christmas, but that although January and February's trading was in line with expectations, March's was weaker.
Majestic said that this sales performance, coupled with ""adverse foreign exchange movements in March"", meant Majestic would announce adjusted pre-tax profit of approximately 21m in June.",0
"Flood warnings continued on Saturday for parts of hurricane-damaged Puerto Rico on Saturday, as officials continued to monitor the Guajataca Dam that was in danger of failing.
The National Weather Service warned Friday that the failure of Guajataca Dam in northwest Puerto Rico was ""imminent"" and could lead to flash flooding for some 70,000 people that could be affected if it collapsed.
As of 1:55 p.m. Saturday, the weather service said ""dam operators continued to report the threat of a failure of the Guajataca Dam, potentially causing life-threatening flash flooding downstream on Rio Guajataca.""
At least 10 people have been confirmed dead in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit the U. S. territory, Puerto Rico's governor's office said Saturday. Most of Puerto Rico has lost power, and the governor’s office said that so far only around a quarter of the island has water service.
""We were able to directly observe the damages of the Guajataca dam,"" Gov. Ricardo Rossello said on Twitter Saturday. ""We re-affirm the evacuation order for the area.""
The National Weather Service said late Friday that a flash flooding warning in western Quebradillas and eastern Isabela covered an area where around 8,000 people live. The flash flood warning for Isabella Quebradillas was extended Saturday.
""Stay away or be swept away,"" the weather service said in a bulletin Saturday.
If the Guajataca Dam at the northern end of Lake Guajataca breaches, the weather service said there was the possibility of ""extremely dangerous"" flash flooding downstream on the Rio Guajataca River.
The dam, which was built in 1929, is used for public water and irrigation water supply, and the reservoir has a water storage capacity of 11 billion gallons.
Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico since 1928, had maximum sustained winds of 155 mph when it made landfall as a Category 4 storm on Thursday. The storm is blamed in 15 deaths in the Caribbean nation of Dominica and one death on Guadeloupe.
The monster storm ripped roofs off buildings and flooded homes, leading to power outages that could last for months.
As of 5 p.m. Saturday, Maria was moving north along open ocean away from the Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center said. It was around 285 miles east of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas with winds of 115 mph.
There are now no storm watches or warnings in effect, although it could generate swells that will affect parts of the southeastern United States and the mid-Atlantic coast, the hurricane center said.",0
"Researchers said Tuesday they are testing a new drug in men who still have evidence of Ebola virus in their semen months after they’ve recovered.
The study, partly sponsored by the U. S. National Institutes of Health, will test whether the drug can clear the virus from the men’s bodies. At least one fresh outbreak of Ebola in Liberia has been traced to the semen of a man who had recovered from the infection.
“We know that traces of Ebola virus can sometimes remain in a recovered person’s body and can initiate a new bout of illness in the survivor or be passed onto others, which could start a new chain of infection in the community,” said Dr. Tony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the NIH.
The two-year-long epidemic of Ebola infected 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
Even after doctors thought they’d stopped new infections, cases would pop up seemingly out of the blue. In March 2015, a woman died of Ebola in Liberia. Investigations determined she was almost certainly infected by her fiancé, an Ebola survivor.
Many survivors have suffered long-term consequences of their infection, often caused by the virus surviving in hard-to-reach pockets of the body.
The trial will test a drug called GS-5734, made by drug company Gilead Sciences, which specializes in antiviral drugs. It’s protected animals against Ebola and has been safe in early tests in people.
The study is one of several the U. S. government wants to continue funding even after the end of the Ebola epidemic. Experts say Ebola is certain to come back again in Africa, and point to the West African epidemic as evidence of how vital it is to keep working on vaccines and drugs to treat it.
Some of this Ebola funding has figured in the fight for Zika funding in Congress. Some Republican members have proposed Zika funding packages that take money from programs aimed at Ebola, saying that Zika is a more urgent priority and Ebola can wait. The White House has asked for $1.9 billion in fresh funding to fight Zika’s spread, saying both programs need the money.
Zika virus, which is unrelated to Ebola, can also be spread by men’s semen.
The World Health Organization advises Ebola survivors to abstain from sex for three months or use a condom. Ebola definitely spreads through bodily fluids — vomit and diarrhea, blood and even sweat. Infection requires close, sustained contact, however, and caregivers are most at risk, as are the people who prepare the bodies of people killed by Ebola.

Other drugs against Ebola are also in testing, including ZMapp, a cocktail of antibodies. One drug made by the former drug company Tekmira, now renamed Arbutus Biopharma, was dropped after it did not show good efficacy.",0
"Some researchers question whether dogs experience feelings like love and loyalty, or whether their winning ways are just a matter of instincts that evolved because being a hanger-on is an easier way to make a living than running down elk. Raymond Coppinger, a professor emeritus of biology at Hampshire College, noted in his landmark 2001 book, “Dogs,” that “best friend” is not an “ecological definition.” And he suggested that “the domestic house dog may have evolved into a parasite.”
Researchers also point out that of the estimated one billion dogs in the world, only a quarter of them are pets. The vast majority of dogs run free in villages, scavenge food at dumps, cadge the odd handout and cause tens of thousands of human deaths each year from rabies. They are sometimes friendly, but not really friends.
Modern dogs are different from modern wolves in numerous ways. They eat comfortably in the presence of people, whereas wolves do not. Their skulls are wider and snouts shorter. They do not live in pack structures when they are on their own, and so some scientists scoff at dog-training approaches that require the human to act as pack leader.
Wolves mate for the long haul and wolf dads help with the young, while dogs are completely promiscuous and the males pay no attention to their offspring. Still, dogs and wolves interbreed easily and some scientists are not convinced that the two are even different species, a skepticism that reflects broader debates in science about how to define a species, and how much the category is a fact of nature as opposed to an arbitrary line drawn by humans.
If current divisions between species are murky, the past lies in deep darkness. Scientists generally agree that there is good evidence that dogs were domesticated around 15,000 years ago. By 14,000 years ago, people were burying dogs, sometimes along with humans. But some biologists argue, based on DNA evidence and the shape of ancient skulls, that dog domestication occurred well over 30,000 years ago.
And as to where the process occurred, researchers studying dog and wolf DNA — most of it modern but some from ancient sources — have argued in recent years that dogs originated in East Asia, Mongolia, Siberia, Europe and Africa.
One reason for the conflicting theories, according to Greger Larson, a biologist in the archaeology department at the University of Oxford, is that dog genetics are a mess. In an interview at his office here in November, he noted that most dog breeds were invented in the 19th century during a period of dog obsession that he called “the giant whirlwind blender of the European crazy Victorian dog-breeding frenzy.”
That blender, as well as random breeding by dogs themselves, and interbreeding with wolves at different times over at least the last 15,000 years, created a “tomato soup” of dog genetics, for which the ingredients are very hard to identify, Dr. Larson said.
The way to find the recipe, Dr. Larson is convinced, is to create a large database of ancient DNA to add to the soup of modern canine genetics. And with a colleague, Keith Dobney at the University of Aberdeen, he has persuaded the Who’s Who of dog researchers to join a broad project, with about $2.5 million in funding from the Natural Environment Research Council in England and the European Research Council, to analyze ancient bones and their DNA.
Robert Wayne, an evolutionary biologist at U. C.L.A. who studies the origin of dogs and is part of the research, said, “There’s hardly a person working in canine genetics that’s not working on that project.”
That is something of a triumph, given the many competing theories in this field. “Almost every group has a different origination hypothesis,” he said.
But Dr. Larson has sold them all on the simple notion that the more data they have, the more cooperative the effort is, the better the answers are going to be. His personality has been crucial to promoting the team effort, said Dr. Wayne, who described Dr. Larson as “very outgoing, gregarious.” Also, Dr. Wayne added, “He has managed not to alienate anyone.”
Scientists at museums and universities who are part of the project are opening up their collections. So to gather data, Dr. Larson and his team at Oxford have traveled the world, collecting tiny samples of bone and measurements of teeth, jaws and occasionally nearly complete skulls from old and recent dogs, wolves and canids that could fall into either category. The collection phase is almost done, said Dr. Larson, who expects to end up with DNA from about 1,500 samples, and photographs and detailed measurements of several thousand.
Scientific papers will start to emerge this year from the work, some originating in Oxford, and some from other institutions, all the work of many collaborators.
Dr. Larson is gambling that the project will be able to determine whether the domestication process occurred closer to 15,000 or 30,000 years ago, and in what region it took place. That’s not quite the date, GPS location and name of the ancient hunter that some dog lovers might hope for.
But it would be a major achievement in the world of canine science, and a landmark in the analysis of ancient DNA to show evolution, migrations and descent, much as studies of ancient hominid DNA have shown how ancient humans populated the globe and interbred with Neanderthals.
And why care about the domestication of dogs, beyond the obsessive interest so many people have in their pets? The emergence of dogs may have been a watershed.
“Maybe dog domestication on some level kicks off this whole change in the way that humans are involved and responding to and interacting with their environment,” he added. “I don’t think that’s outlandish.”
Dr. Larson is no stranger to widely varying points of view. He is an American, but recently became a British citizen as well. His parents are American and he visited the United States often as a child, but he was born in Bahrain and grew up in Turkey and Japan, places where his parents were teaching in schools on American military bases.
He graduated from Claremont McKenna College in California and received his Ph. D. at Oxford. In between college and graduate studies, he spent a year searching for the bed of an ancient river in Turkmenistan, and another couple of years setting up an environmental consulting office in Azerbaijan. He had an interest in science as an undergraduate, and some background from a college major in environment, economics and politics, but no set career plans. Instead, his career grew out of intense curiosity, a knack for making friends and a willingness to jump at an opportunity, like the time he managed to tag along on an archaeological dig.
He was staying in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and a local man who had helped him rent an old Soviet truck to explore the desert told him some Westerners were arriving to go on a dig, so he wangled his way onto one of the trucks.
“I think everybody there thought I was with somebody else,” Dr. Larson said.
By the time the group stopped to rest and someone asked him who he was, it was too late to question whether he really belonged. “I was a complete stowaway,” he said.
But he could move dirt and speak Russian, and he had some recently acquired expertise — in college drinking games — that he said was in great demand at night. By luck, he said, the researchers on the dig turned out to be “the great and the good of British neolithic archaeology.” One of them was Chris Gosden, the chairman of European Archaeology at Oxford, who later invited him to do a one-year master's degree in archaeology at Oxford. That eventually led to a doctoral program after he spent some time in graduate school in the United States.
The current project began when he became fed up with the lack of ancient DNA evidence in papers about the origin of dogs. He called Dr. Dobney, of the University of Aberdeen in 2011, and said, “We’re doing dogs.”
After receiving the grant from the council in England, he and Dr. Dobney organized a conference in Aberdeen, Scotland, to gather as many people involved in researching dog origins as they could. His pitch to the group was that despite their different points of view, everyone was interested in the best possible evidence, no matter where it led.
“If we have to eat crow, we eat crow,” he said. “It’s science.”
Mietje Germonpré, a paleontologist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, is one of the many scientists participating in the dog project. She was one of a number of authors on a 2013 paper in Science that identified a skull about 32,000 years old from a Belgian cave in Goyet as an early dog. Dr. Wayne at U. C.L.A. was the senior author on the paper and Olaf Thalmann from the University of Turku in Finland was the first author.
It is typical of Dr. Larson’s dog project that although he disagreed with the findings of the paper, arguing that the evidence just wasn’t there to call the Goyet skull a dog, all of the authors of the paper are working on the larger project with him.
In November in Brussels, holding the priceless fossil, Dr. Germonpré pointed out the wide skull, crowded teeth and short snout of the ancient skull — all indicators to her that it was not a wolf.
“To me, it’s a dog,” she said. Studies of mitochondrial DNA, passed down from females only, also indicated the skull was not a wolf, according to the 2013 paper.
Dr. Germonpré said she thinks dogs were domesticated some time before this animal died, and she leans toward the idea that humans intentionally bred them from wolves.
She holds up another piece of evidence, a reconstruction of a 30,000-year-old canid skull found near Predmostí, in the Czech Republic, with a bone in its mouth. She reported in 2014 that this was a dog. And she says the bone is part of evidence the animal was buried with care. “We think it was deliberately put there,” she said.
But she recognizes these claims are controversial and is willing, like the rest of the world of canine science, to risk damage to the fossils themselves to get more information on not just the mitochondrial DNA but also the nuclear DNA.
To minimize that risk, she talked with Ardern Hulme-Beaman, a postdoctoral researcher with the Oxford team, about where to cut into it. He was nearing the end of months of traveling to Russia, Turkey, the United States and all over Europe to take samples of canid jaws and skulls.
He and Allowen Evin, now with the National Center for Scientific Research in Montpellier, France, also took many photographs of each jaw and skull to do geometric morphometrics. Software processes detailed photographs from every angle into 3-D recreations that provide much more information on the shape of a bone than length and width measurements.
Dr. Germonpré and Dr. Hulme-Beaman agreed on a spot in the interior of the skull to cut. In the laboratory, he used a small electric drill with a cutting blade to remove a chunk the size of a bit of chopped walnut. An acrid, burning smell indicated that organic material was intact within the bone — a good sign for the potential retrieval of DNA.
Back in Oxford, researchers will attempt to use the most current techniques to get as much DNA as possible out of the sample. There is no stretch of code that says “wolf” or “dog,” any more than there is a single skull feature that defines a category. What geneticists try to establish is how different the DNA of one animal is from another. Adding ancient DNA gives many more points of reference over a long time span.
Dr. Larson hopes that he and his collaborators will be able to identify a section of DNA in some ancient wolves that was passed on to more doglike descendants and eventually to modern dogs. And he hopes they will be able to identify changes in the skulls or jaws of those wolves that show shifts to more doglike shapes, helping to narrow the origins of domestication.
The usual assumption about domestic animals is that the process of taming and breeding them happened once. But that’s not necessarily so. Dr. Larson and Dr. Dobney showed that pigs were domesticated twice, once in Anatolia and once in China. The same could be true of dogs.
Although the gathering of old bones is almost done, Dr. Larson is still negotiating with Chinese researchers for samples from that part of the world, which he says are necessary. But he hopes they will come.
If all goes well, said Dr. Larson, the project will publish a flagship paper from all of the participants describing their general findings. And over the next couple of years, researchers, all using the common data, will continue to publish separate findings.
Other large collaborative efforts are brewing, as well. Dr. Wayne, at U. C.L.A., said that a group in China was forming with the goal of sequencing 10,000 dog genomes. He and Dr. Larson are part of that group.
Last fall, Dr. Larson was becoming more excited with each new bit of data, but not yet ready to tip his hand about what conclusions the data may warrant, or how significant they will be.
But he is growing increasingly confident that they will find what they want, and come close to settling the thorny question of when and where the tearing power of a wolf jaw first gave way to the persuasive force of a nudge from a dog’s cold nose.
“I’m starting to drink my own Kool-Aid,” he said.

When everything was said and done, the frustrated mother said the ordeal took “well over an hour.” She accused TSA officials of “deliberately” keeping them from making their flight.
“We were treated like dogs because I requested they attempt to screen him in other ways per TSA rules,” Williamson wrote.
According to Williamson, Aaron suffers from Sensory Processing Disorder, which can result in an oversensitivity to sound and touch. Also, Aaron’s mother was not sure why her child was subjected to such an invasive TSA check, when her son set off “no alarms” and “passed through the detector just fine.”
“I wish I had taped the entire interchange because it was horrifying,” she recalled, noting that, as theordeal was unfolding, two police officers “were called and flanking him on each side.”
“Somehow these power tripping TSA agents who are traumatizing children and doing whatever they feel like without any cause, need to be reined in,” she added.
Williamson asked those who see the video on Facebook to help “make this viral.” So far, more than 7,000 people have reacted to the video and it has been shared nearly 20,000 times.
This most recent issue with the TSA comes several months after agency officialsat the Los Angeles International Airport drew immediate backlash for subjecting a breast cancer patient to a what some people called a “horrific” body search.
“I have never been so humiliated or felt more violated in my life,”Denise Albert, co-founder of The Moms, a lifestyle brand on television, the internet and in print, wrote in December.
According to Albert, she was pulled aside by aggressive TSA agents for a full-body pat-down, much like Aaron’s, because they spotted a tube of medical cream stashed in her carry-on bag.
The most difficult part for Albert, who has had a lumpectomy, was when TSA officers told her they had to pat down her breasts, “us as much pressure” as necessary “to clear the area.”The officers also forced her to remove her wig — the first time she had done so publicly, aside from a couple appearances at breast cancer awareness events.
“I didn’t want them touching my head. It caused me a lot of anxiety and I just started crying,” she said. “When I kept asking why they needed to do all of this,they kept saying because I wanted to bring medical cream on the plane.”
Ultimately, Albert said she received a call from a TSA official, who apologized for her treatment and the agency’s 3,000 LAX officers would be immediately retrained on how to approach travelers with medical conditions.",0
"SANTA ROSA, Calif. -- Crews fighting the California wildfireswere making progress Monday night as winds that fanned the flames were beginning to die down.
A driver delivering water to the fire lines was killed when his truck flipped. There are now 41 deaths in the fires. A total of 213,000 acres have burned and nearly 6,000 buildings have been destroyed.
Some evacuees are heading home to see if they still have one.
When the Tubbs Fire came racing down into Santa Rosa, Assistant Fire Marshall Paul Lowenthal was called into service.
""I wouldn't imagine we would have something that big, all of a sudden, right here,"" Lowenthal said.
As the fire continues to burn, officials are now turning their attention to making these neighborhoods safer.
Santa Rosa's Fountain Grove neighborhood has been designated by the state as a ""very high fire hazard"" zone, requiring homeowners to clear brush and use fire resistant materials on their roofs.
But Coffey Park, a dense neighborhood, is considered a safe area with limited requirements. Neither neighborhood could withstand a fire fueled by 80 mph winds.
""There's a lot of systems and codes that have been put in place to make it safer, to make it a safer environment. But mother nature brought wind,"" Lowenthal said.
The neighborhood is woven within California's wildland, a prime example of the state's suburban sprawl.
In 1960, there were 766 homes within the perimeter of the Tubbs Fire, compared to more than 6,000 in 2010.
""I don't think anybody would have ever guessed we would have a wildfire that would move through the volume of hotels, commercial buildings, restaurants, areas where there is little to no landscaping -- it burned through all that,"" Lowenthal said.
Thousands of evacuation orders have been lifted, but in wildland areas it could take days, if not weeks, before the rebuilding can start. There is rain expected later this week, which fire crews are hoping will help them reach their containment goals of 100 percent by Friday.",0
"Ministers accused of ‘stubborn failure’ to tackle widespread and illegal levels of air pollution, which cause 40,000 early deaths every year
Ministers accused of ‘stubborn failure’ to tackle widespread and illegal levels of air pollution, which cause 40,000 early deaths every year
The UK government is being sued for a third time over the widespread illegal levels of air pollution, which cause 40,000 early deaths every year.
Environmental lawyers ClientEarth have already defeated ministers twice in court, forcing a new pollution plan to be drawn up in July. But ClientEarth believes even the latest strategy does not meet the legal requirement of banishing toxic air in the “shortest possible time”, as EU law requires.
“The UK government’s stubborn failure to tackle illegal and harmful levels of pollution in this country means that we have no choice but to take legal action,” said James Thornton, ClientEarth’s CEO. “We need clarity from the government and for that we’ve been forced to go back to court.”
ClientEarth sent ministers a pre-action legal letter setting out their concerns in October but deemed the government’s response inadequate. They have now applied to the courts for a legal hearing. The government has already spent 370,000 of taxpayers’ money in failed attempts to fight air pollution court action.
Nitrogen dioxide pollution, mostly produced by diesel vehicles, has been illegally high in most urban parts of Britain since 2010. The government’s latest plan was condemned as “woefully inadequate” by city leaders and “inexcusable” by doctors.
Air pollution causes an estimated 23,500 early deaths every year from NO2, rising to 40,000 when other pollutants are considered. In September, the UN’s special rapporteur on pollution said the government was “flouting” its duty to protect the lives and health of its citizens and in October a major pollution report estimated the number of premature deaths in the UK at 50,000 per year.
Oliver Hayes, at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s shameful that the government has to keep being taken to court to try to force it to protect the health of its citizens.”
ClientEarth believes there are several grounds for judicial review, including backtracking in the latest plan on “clear air zones” in Birmingham, Derby, Leeds, Nottingham and Southampton. These zones, which would use charges to deter polluting vehicles from city centres, were mandatory in previous plans but are now only “expected” to be implemented.
ClientEarth also say it is unacceptable that the plan requires no action in 45 local authorities with illegal levels of air pollution. These include Leicester, Oxford, Liverpool, Cheltenham and Sunderland, with the government arguing toxic air will fall to legal levels without enforced action.
However, Leicester and Oxford city councils have written to ministers saying that the government has seriously underestimated pollution levels and that by requiring no action, they are stopping the councils getting access to funding to cut pollution. Oxford is planning to ban all petrol and diesel vehicles in the future.
Some motoring groups are campaigning against a crackdown on diesel cars, but the latest data shows car buyers are abandoning the technology, with sales down by 30% in October year-on-year. The government’s own analysis shows charging zones to deter dirty cars are by far the most effective policy but ministers have told councils they should only be the option of last resort.
“It’s time ministers came clean about the size of the problem and the difficult decisions needed to solve it,” said Thornton. He said the forthcoming budget should use tax changes to make diesel cars less attractive and that the motor industry should be made to contribute funding.
“The car industry helped get us into this mess so they should be helping get us out of it by contributing to a clean air fund, as they have done in Germany,” Thornton said. The German government recently secured 250m (220m) from the car industry to help cities reduce pollution.
A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We have put in place a 3bn plan to improve air quality and reduce harmful emissions. We will also end the sale of new diesel and petrol cars by 2040, and next year we will publish a comprehensive Clean Air Strategy which will set out further steps to tackle air pollution.”
The decision to take the government back to court came as four air pollution protesters were jailed for staging a series of direct action demonstrations against toxic air in the capital.
The fouractivists are from the environmental group Stop Killing Londoners, which has been stepping up its campaign calling on the government and the mayor of London to do more to tackle air pollution.
Camberwell magistrates court heard on Tuesday that the group had spray-painted “Cut Air Pollution” on City Hall on Monday night before sitting down and waiting to be arrested for criminal damage.
Roger Hallam, 51, Stuart Basden, 34, Ian Bray, 50, and Genny Scherer, 71, were under strict bail conditions not to go within 50m of the building after they graffitied it earlier this week. The four all deny criminal damage.
In a statement released after the hearing, the group said at least two of those imprisoned would go on hunger strike while being held on remand.
It said Monday’s arrests were the fifth action in the past week by the campaign amid growing anger at the air pollution crisis. They have demanded a meeting with environmental secretary Michael Gove and London mayor Sadiq Khan.
In a statement they added: “Today, the four of us are being sent to prison because we apparently care too much. We care about the 25 people who are killed every day in London by the illegal levels of air pollution. We care about the children who will endure a lifetime of suffering due to shrunken lungs. We care, because each breath we take is harming us, and puts even more strain on the NHS as it struggles to cope with unnecessary cuts.”
The chairwoman of the bench, Finola Gowers, remanded the protesters in custody for seven days and said they faced a possible custodial sentence if convicted.",0
"Impropriety among big-pharmaceutical corporations has ranged from multi-billion dollar bribery rackets, to marketing drugs to patients for uses they were never approved for by regulators, to covering up known dangerous side-effects of medications they produce and sell.
More recently, big-pharma has been embroiled in a series of price-gouging controversies over equipment and treatments. This includes the hijacking of and profiteering from a revolutionary new treatment called gene therapy.
Gene therapy, the process of re-engineering human cells to either include missing DNA to cure genetic conditions or to arm the immune system to seek and destroy disease, has been the latest hopeful technology scooped up and plundered by big-pharma.
Gene therapy promises a single-shot cure to many of the diseases that have confounded humanity the most – everything from diabetes to cancer, to blindness, deafness, and even various effects of aging.
At least two treatments using gene therapy have been approved for European markets.
A third that has proven in clinical trials to provide permanent remission for leukemia patients who were unresponsive to chemotherapy, appears to be close to FDA approval.
The Literal Cure for Cancer, Dangled Over the Dying
While the treatment – even under experimental conditions – costs approximately $20,000 to produce, pharmaceutical giant Novartis has swooped in and industry experts anticipate a markup leaving the price tag between $300,000-600,000.
in a 2012 article titled, “In Girl’s Last Hope, Altered Immune Cells Beat Leukemia,” reported that (emphasis added):
Dr. June said that producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient — far less than the cost of a bone-marrow transplant. Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive, he said, but he added, “Our costs do not include any profit margin, facility depreciation costs or other clinical care costs, and other research costs.”
More recently, in a July 2017  article titled, “First gene therapy — ‘a true living drug’ — on the cusp of FDA approval,” its reported that:
Novartis has not disclosed the price for its therapy, but analysts are predicting $300,000 to $600,000 for a one-time infusion. Brad Loncar, whose investment fund focuses on companies that develop immunotherapy treatments, hopes the cost does not prompt a backlash. “CAR-T is not the EpiPen,” he said. “This is truly pushing the envelope and at the cutting edge of science.”
But it isn’t Novartis that’s “pushing the envelop,” or at “the cutting edge of science.” Charity-funded university researchers are.
and the  both appear to give Novartis credit for this breakthrough in their article, with  claiming that the company invested some $20 million on a research center to bring the treatment to market. However, that appears not to be entirely true.
It was, in fact, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) that funded the initial work toward this breakthrough, beginning in the late 1990s and committing some $21 million to the effort.
Novartis is indeed a partner of LLS, but according to LLS’ own annual reports (2016, PDF), it is listed under the second tier of donors – providing between $500,000-900,000 out of the total $35.6 million LLS received in direct gifts that year. In some years Novartis has donated even less.
LLS has invested in the work of June and colleagues since 1998 and has committed to investing a total of $21 million through 2017 to get this first treatment to more patients. LLS first funded Grupp in 1992 through its career development program. LLS has also been funding another member of the team, David Porter, M. D. of University of Pennsylvania since 1994.
Elsewhere, LLS reports cite that this breakthrough in curing leukemia has “attracted” Novartis as a partner, never mentioning that Novartis is actually a long-term LLS partner.
In reality, it appears pharmaceutical corporations like Novartis are using charities like LLS to fund research and development that corporations themselves should be investing in. Instead, Novartis and others are poaching public and charity-funded research and breakthroughs, profiting from what is often decades of dedicated and difficult work.
Beyond LLS’ partners, it receives millions of dollars annually from other donors ranging from businesses unrelated to the pharmaceutical industry, to fundraising events held nationwide, to families and individuals who have experienced cancer either themselves or through a family member or friend.
The research and breakthroughs LLS funds belong to all of its donors. How the work it funded has ended up in the hands of a single corporation, facing a mark up of anywhere between 15-30 times its cost during experimental trials demands scrutiny and a detailed explanation.
Gene therapy overall threatens the fundamental business model pharmaceutical giants are built on – that is to perpetually peddle medication that covers up the symptoms of disease rather than outright curing it.
It is a business practice that provides profits easily predicted quarter to quarter, with some medications leading to complications big-pharma also has a pill for. Something that treats a patient permanently with a single, inexpensive shot constitutes big-pharma’s worst nightmare.
in an article titled, “A First-of-a-Kind Gene Therapy Cure Has Struggled to Find a Market,” tells the tale of another pharmaceutical corporation – GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), of another revolutionary gene therapy it scooped up from research done by others, its $665,000 price tag, and why GSK – along with the rest of big-pharma – are disinterested in gene therapy.
[Alex] Pasteur [investor with F-Prime Capital Partners and interim CEO of Orchard Therapeutics] also says revenues for a rare-disease gene therapy might only ever add up to $100 million a year. Because GSK brings in $36 billion a year, Pasteur is not surprised the company is looking elsewhere for revenue. “These are pimples on the back of a whale,” he says. “But the assets could be very interesting for someone else.”
Indeed, a single shot that costs only a few thousand dollars and permanently cures people of virtually every human health infliction not only isn’t profitable, but will likely put these enormous, abusive monopolies out of business for good.
Obamacare vs Trumpcare: Nobody Cares, But Innovation Cures
Education is the first step in combating the hijacking and burying of gene therapy and other innovations.
At a time when people arguing over Obamacare versus Trumpcare are realizing that no one actually cares about their health more than they themselves, innovation like gene therapy offers to make healthcare so affordable and effective, insurance schemes and government subsidies would be unnecessary.
But gene therapy will only gain traction if the wider public knows about it, including its implications for not only improving their own health, but improving the healthcare systems of their respective nations.
The public must also understand the true costs behind gene therapy and where money for research has come from – often from public funding or charity. This knowledge allows the public to call out pharmaceutical corporations attempting to seize credit and profits entirely for themselves.
While pharmaceutical corporations invest inordinate amounts of money attempting to convince the world that they are indispensable, university researchers funded by public money and charity prove they are more often than not setting breakthroughs back, not moving them forward.
If the good people involved in LLS are capable of raising the money to fund these breakthroughs, they are capable of creating a pharmaceutical trust that can bring these cures to market with greater transparency and oversight.
Healthcare debates focused purely on political solutions and debates are frustrating. Getting behind gene therapy and other tangible healthcare innovations is something people can better invest their time, money, energy, and attention into instead.

When employees of Nevada’s Great Basin National Park went out on a routine check, they came across something totally extraordinary. In a remote area of the park, they found an 1882 Winchester rifle leaning up against one of the trees.
Because it had been left there more than a century before (some experts are claiming it was abandoned about 132 years ago!), it had become rusted and weathered.
If the park employees had not been looking closely, they would never have noticed the rifle. Over the years, it had taken on much the same colors as the juniper tree it was rested against. This natural camouflage explains why it had gone undiscovered for a century.
Scroll down for a video and to hear what archaeologists say about the Winchester 1873 rifle!
Anyone that has visited the Great Basin National Park in Nevada has been blessed with beautiful night skies and epic terrain.
But finding this old gun leaning against the tree was a different kind of excitement. Archaeologists were excited by the find. Here’s what they shared with GeoBeats News via the YouTube video description:
“A Winchester Rifle that dates back to 1882 was discovered leaning up against a tree. Park employees shared photos of the find on Facebook.
The Park’s Facebook post wrote: “The cracked wood stock, weathered to grey, and the brown rusted barrel blended into the colors of the old juniper tree in a remote rocky outcrop, keeping the rifle hidden for many years.”
Although the gun had been left behind about one hundred and thirty years ago, the serial number was still legible.  When investigators did some digging, they found that the digits on the serial matched documentation at Wyoming’s Cody Firearms Museum at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West. Amazing find indeed!
Those details indicated that this rifle was manufactured and shipped in the year 1882. But the paperwork does not say who bought the gun – leaving a piece of the mystery unsolved.
In 1882, more than 25,000 models of this rifle were sold for $25-50.
Because the firearm is an amazing find, park employees continue to search for its original owner. They really want to know WHY this gun was left leaning up against a tree in Nevada.
After the investigation is finished, the rifle will go back to the Great Basin National Park to be put on exhibit. It will be shown as part of the National Park Service centennial festivities and the Great Basic National Park’s 30th birthday!
Nearly 500,000 people have watched the YouTube video report about this long-lost Winchester. Here are some of the most popular comments:
“i have spent a lot of time up in this part of the world and have found old mines and mining gear that look like they had only been there a few yrs.”
“I wonder how many people walked by it over the years?”
What would you do if you found an old Winchester rifled on a hike in the park?

"In a 5-day raid operation, almost 200 illegal immigrants have been apprehended by Federal immigration officers, aiming criminals which have been familiar or suspected of being illegally inside the U. S. Los Angeles region.
On Thursday, the operation was finished and exactly 188 immigrants were arrested in Los Angeles and areas nearby.
David Marin, Field Officer Director for ERO in Los Angeles, said that “Operations like this are emblematic of the vital work ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations officers do every day seeking to locate, arrest, and ultimately deport at-large convicted criminals and other immigration fugitives who pose a threat to public safety.”
“By taking these individuals off the streets and removing them from the country, we’re making our communities safer for everyone,” Marin added.
169 out of the 188 apprehended people had previous crimes like domestic violence, drug offenses and driving under influence, and eight of them now are facing federal prosecution for coming back the country after being ejected.
The majority of the apprehended people were recognized as Mexicans, and the others were from Armenia, Cambodia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Philippines, Russia, Thailand, Yugoslavia and Vietnam, with most of the arrests being made in Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura and Santa Barbara.
Four more people were identified by ICE, who had been arrested, a 29-year-old Salvadorian man who was ejected from the country after serving a 9-year jail sentence for rape, and another 47-year-old Mexican with previous felony convictions for assault.
As it was read in ICE reports, up to 41,000 arrests have been made across the US since Donald Trump was inaugurated in January, which is an increase of 40% from the same period in 2016.

"The Republican-led House won't block an Obama-era practice of requiring the Pentagon to pay for gender transition surgeries and hormone therapy.
Democrats cast the proposal as bigoted, unconstitutional and cowardly and they won support on Thursday from 24 GOP lawmakers to scuttle the amendment to the annual defense policy bill, 214-209.
Lawmakers are expected to vote Friday on passage of the sweeping legislation following more debate over amendments that are often aimed at addressing specific needs in lawmakers' districts. The policy bill would authorize $696 billion for managing the nation's vast military enterprise in 2018, nearly $30 billion more for core Pentagon operations than President Donald Trump requested.
The transgender measure crafted by Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., would have forbid money from being spent by the military's health-care system for medical treatment related to gender transition. Hartzler portrayed her proposal as a good government plan aimed at assuring military dollars are spent only on critical national defense needs.
Hartzler estimated transition surgeries, which she said most private insurance plans don't even cover, could cost the military $1.3 billion over the next 10 years. Troops who have the surgery require months of recovery, she added, which means they're unavailable to do their jobs.
""It makes no sense to create soldiers who are unable to fight and win our nation's wars,"" Hartzler said.
But House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called the amendment an attack on the health and dignity of thousands of U. S. service members, and Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said Hartzler intended to ""politically denigrate"" transgender troops.
""Let us not sink to that level,"" Hoyer said.
Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter of California said people should decide what sex they are before signing up.
""Figure out whether you're man or a woman before you join,"" Hunter said. ""U. S. taxpayers shouldn't have to foot the bill.""
The close vote nonetheless underscored the zeal with which a number of Republicans are seizing opportunities to reverse what they cast as President Barack Obama's social engineering of the armed forces. Transgender service members have been able to serve openly in the military since last year, when former Defense Secretary Ash Carter ended the ban.
Since Oct. 1, transgender troops have been able to receive medical care and start formally changing their gender identifications in the Pentagon's personnel system. A Rand Corp. study found that there are between 2,500 and 7,000 transgender service members in the active-duty military, and another 1,500 to 4,000 in the reserves.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis decided late last month to give the military chiefs another six months to conduct a review to determine if letting transgender people enlist in the armed services will affect the ""readiness or lethality"" of the force. However, the delay doesn't affect transgender troops who already are serving openly in the military.
Hartzler, a four-term congresswoman who has been mentioned as a possible 2018 challenger to Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has suggested forcing transgender service members out of the military services. But she backed away from her plan last month, saying she would give Mattis and other senior military leaders the room to settle personnel matters internally.
LGBTQ advocacy groups condemned Hartzler's amendment. Ashley Broadway-Mach, president of the American Military Partner Association, called the proposal a ""vicious attack on service members who are sacrificing so much and putting their lives on the line for our country.""

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has positioned a new, state-of-the-art missile defense system in eastern area of Siberia in order to show of power in response to constant missile tests conducted by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
As reported by U. K. Daily Mail, the Buk-M3 defense system can counter cruise
missiles, ballistic missiles, military jets and helicopters. This is the very first time it has been positioned in eastern Russian province.
Country’s capital Moscow, which alleges that Western militaries can’t have a chance with the missile defense system, has shown a “profound concern” over North Korea’s missile firings, which have arose tensions in the area, as reported by the U. K. Daily Express.
Vasily Kashin, a researcher from the Institute of the Russian Far East, told The Express the positioning was “a precautionary move” Russia made to watch against “escalation in the Korean Peninsula.”
“The brigade can be relocated further east and used to cover administrative and industrial centers from possible missile or aviation attack,” he added.
The exercise was set to keep on for two more months after which the Buk-M3 “will be fully prepared for combat missions,” The Express reported.
Apparently, the fresh new systems are able to attack up to 36 aims moving at a speed of up to 3,000 meters per second at the same time.
The system will be located in Ulan-Ude, the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, and about 2,000 miles away from the Russian/North Korean border. Nevertheless, weapons experts said the defense system can be instantly relocated.
The Russian President is putting everything out on the table by deploying this new defense system in the area of any military actions that involve Korea.
And he is letting Kim know, as well as the rest of the globe, that he is not joking about it.",1
"LIBERATING ELDER – LOL, THIS IS TOO GOOD. JUST LAST WEEK CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN WAS THREATENING TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES AND FORM A NEW NATION. TODAY HE IS CALLING ‘MR.

Fox 40 reported: LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown has asked President Trump to declare a major disaster for California because of damage from January storms.
The letter sent Friday says the relentless series of storms caused flooding, mudslides, evacuations, erosion, power outages and at least eight deaths. Northern California was hardest hit.
Brown says the storm system was so severe and widespread that state and local governments need federal assistance to continue dealing with the problems it created.
In a separate action, the governor added Amador, Mono and Riverside to the 49 counties included in an emergency proclamation Brown issued last month.

"Black Lives Matter and other groups plan to block white-owned Chicago stores on Black Friday to bring awareness about police shootings, economic issues and alleged racism.
Local churches, Black Lives Matter and the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression will block stores along Michigan Avenue and prevent customers from entering stores for the second year in a row, reports Crain’s Chicago Business.
A big part of the protest is to force on people thatit’s important to shop at businesses that aren’t owned by white men, Kimberly Veal, a leader of Black Lives Matter, said. It’s not yet known who owns the businesses that will be targeted as part of this effort.
“One of the cornerstones about why we’re boycotting on Black Friday is to attempt to redirect people to businesses owned by people of color and women, and explain why it’s important to patronize these businesses,” Veal explained.
Last year, protestersblocked shoppers from entering stores on Black Friday to protest the death of Laquan McDonald, a black teen shot 16 times by an officer. Dash cam video revealed the teen ignoring officer commands to stop as he walked away from officers with a knife in his hands.
Police had to help shoppers get into the stores; as one person tried to enter, protesters screamed “Shut it down! Shut it down!”
After last year’s protest,stores’ saleswere 25 to 50 percent below their expected projections, according to staff and managers.
A sales associate at Aldo said that her store under-performed by $18,000.
“We were down a lot. We were budgeted to make $37,000 but we only did $19,000 — customers told us they were concerned,”saidSarah Midoun.
One of the protest organizer hopes that this year’s protest will have a larger turnout.
“We’re expecting a bigger turnout this year, though this is not an exact science. The reason we’re looking for a bigger turnout is that Trump is the president-elect and, boy, are people pissed,”Frank Chapman, a field organizer with one of the organizations involved, said.
He added that not only race brings the protesters together. “We’ve been calling everyone who has a grievance: the African-American community, Latino people, the white working class,” Chapman explained. “I’m not going to write the white working class off as racist.”",1
"The oil and gas industry is hiring more than it’s letting go for the first time in three years, a new report from recruitment firm NES Global Talent and Oilandgasjopbsearch.com shows.
This is the latest sign of recovery in oil and gas after the 2014 price crash, reinforcing the belief that a lot of oil and gas companies have successfully adjusted to the new level of oil prices, which is still more than 50% below the 2014 highs.
The report’s authors surveyed more than 3,000 oil and gas employers as well as almost 7,000 employees, and found that an impressive majority of 60% of employers had plans to hire significantly more people over the next 12 months. In fact, NES Global Talent notes, 2018 will be the first year since 2014 in which there will be more new hires in oil and gas than layoffs.
In the last three years, more than 440,000 jobs were wiped out in the industry, but now 17% of employers surveyed plan to raise their workforce by more than 10%, with another 19% planning to increase the workforce by 5% to 10% in the next 12 months. Only 11% of employers have further layoff plans.

Oil and gas companies have clearly learned to live with the lower prices, which are now on the upswing, with Brent last week breaching $60 a barrel, the coveted price that OPEC strove for when it agreed to cut 1.2 million BPD in daily production at the end of last year. With a tighter capital spending program and a much stricter cost discipline, many E&Ps are not just surviving but expanding production.
In some places, such as the Permian — the hottest spot in the U. S. shale patch — this has brought about a new challenge: finding enough new hires, as a lot of those workers who lost their jobs amid the crisis have moved on to other careers.
A recent story from the Houston Chronicle details the problems oilfield service providers face now that their workload has increased substantially and qualified workers are hard to come by. One such company, Byrd Oilfield Service, is losing an estimated $7,000 a day because it can’t hire truck drivers fast enough to deliver equipment to its frac crews in the oilfields.
This situation was only to be expected: When oil prices crashed, everyone in the industry started laying off workers. That was the knee-jerk reaction of an industry that for decades followed the growth-at-all-costs approach to business management. But while these layoffs helped many companies survive, they also became a ticking time bomb.
Not only did a lot of workers change careers amid the price downturn, but also many high school graduates scrapped their plans to pursue oil and gas-related degrees in higher education.
This is now worrying analysts and investors alike. The problem may seem like a short-term one and workers might start flocking back to oil and gas when employers offer them more money. But it is just as likely that many people will refuse to return to an industry as fickle as oil and gas. That would be a long-term problem that, according to industry executives, could cripple oil and gas for decades to come.

"Chief Judge Roger Gregory wrote the dissenting opinion, arguing that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment ""does not require the government to purge from the public sphere any reference to religion.""
The memorial was completed in 1925 using contributions from private donors and the American Legion. In 1961, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission acquired the monument and the land it sits on, and has spent $117,000 to maintain and repair the cross. In 2008, an additional $100,000 was set aside for future reparations.
The American Legion, which was represented by the First Liberty Institute, a law firm that seeks to protect religious freedom, plans on appealing the case to the Supreme Court, said Kelly Shackelford, the president and CEO of First Liberty.
Oklahoma Supreme Court orders removal of Ten Commandments
""If this is the precedent, all (war memorials) are in jeopardy,"" Shackelford told CNN. ""The kind of sandblasting and bulldozing we're talking about would be breathtaking to most Americans.""
Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis said the organization has supported the defendants in the case since the beginning and will continue to do so in the appeal process.
""The wrong call was made,"" Davis told CNN. ""Our nation should be building and protecting our memorial to our dead.""
If the Supreme Court declines to hear the case, a district court judge would have to decide whether to order the removal of the cross, said David Niose, legal director of the American Humanist Association.
""It's hard to think of remedies other than removal,"" Niose told CNN, though he said there is the ""possibility of modifying the structure.""
In the majority opinion, Thacker and Wynn wrote that the parties are ""free to explore alternative arrangements that would not offend the Constitution,"" such as removing the arms of the cross to create an obelisk.
Niose also suggested that the cross be moved to private property.
But Shackelford is opposed to modifying or relocating the monument.
""I think desecrating a national veteran memorial that's been around for a hundred years is a horrible idea,"" he said.",0
"Saturday's FA Cup final between Arsenal and Aston Villa at Wembley will be watched by half a billion viewers in more than 120 countries.
Close to 90,000 fans will be at Wembley for the 134th final of the world's oldest cup competition as two teams of elite, millionaire sportsmen battle it out for glory.
But what exactly was the scene at the original final way back in 1872?
An estimated crowd of 2,000 were there to see 22 amateurs play on a cricket pitch, with no nets, as Wanderers beat Royal Engineers 1-0 thanks to a goal from Morton Betts.
BBC Sport, with the help of Matthew Taylor, professor of history at De Montfort University, look at the first final 143 years ago...
Prior to the 1872 FA Cup, there were no regular competitive games being played in England. Football Association secretary Charles Alcock drew up plans for the first FA Cup which saw 15 teams enter the first round of November 1871.
Step forward Barnes, Civil Service, Hitchin, Crystal Palace (confusingly not the present-day Palace but their precursors who were dissolved in 1876), Maidenhead, Marlow, Queen's Park, Donington School, Upton Park, Clapham Rovers, Royal Engineers, Reigate Priory, Wanderers, Harrow Chequers and Hampstead Heathens, who were given a bye.
Teething problems and the logistical headaches of scheduling football matches across Britain in the era of steam meant that Scottish side Queen's Park advanced to the semi-finals without actually playing a game.
The semi-finals - both goalless draws - were played at the Kennington Oval. The Royal Engineers booked their place in the final with a 3-0 replay win over Crystal Palace, while Wanderers made it through when Queen's Park decided they could not afford another costly trip to London for the replay and withdrew.
The historian's view: ""The general consensus is that the FA Cup was based on the knockout competitions between 'Houses' at major public schools such as Harrow. But Alcock may also have taken inspiration from existing competitions in the provinces, such as Sheffield's Youdon Cup, launched in 1867.
""Certainly football was equally, if not more, established and popular in Sheffield as it was in London at this time, and the elite ex-public schoolboys based in the capital knew and played against teams from Sheffield, Nottingham and elsewhere.""
Alcock - the brains behind the whole idea - played in defence for Wanderers.
Formed in 1859 as Forest Football Club, the side mainly consisted of former Harrow public schoolboys and took the name 'Wanderers' because they played their matches at different grounds. But by 1869 the club was based at the Kennington Oval, where Alcock also happened to be the secretary of Surrey cricket club.
The Royal Engineers were founded in 1863 by Major Francis Marindin - an extraordinary man. Having served in the Crimean war, he would go on to play in the 1872 final, become president of the FA in 1874 and then referee eight further FA Cup finals.
The 1872 final was held at Kennington Oval, also the venue for the first international football match between England and Scotland in 1870.
The Oval would go on to host 20 of the next 21 FA Cup finals, with the 1873 final played at Lillie Bridge - close to Chelsea's modern home at Stamford Bridge.
The historian's view: ""Many football clubs played on cricket grounds in the late 19th century. Football clubs often emerged from existing cricket clubs, as a way of the players keeping fit in the winter. Purpose-built football grounds did not emerge in significant numbers until the 1880s and 1890s.""
While fans at this year's final will have to battle through the crowds at Wembley, it was a more sedate affair in 1872. Football had yet to catch on and around 2,000 are said to have been at the Oval.
Much has changed beyond recognition in football but the cost of attending remains an issue...
The historian's view: ""Attendances for football matches were not large in the early 1870s, with one reason for the relatively low attendance the price of tickets, which at one shilling (five pence in today's money) was higher than for most matches at the time.
""The Oval crowd was said to be 'very fashionable', so presumably made up of the well-to-do and the upper middle-class, as well as those connected with the 'old boys' public school network that ran the Football Association at this time.""
The Royal Engineers could lay claim to being the Barcelona of their day, with their revolutionary tactic of 'passing' the ball to a team-mate at odds with the usual approach of chasing the ball into space.
The only goal of the final came after 15 minutes when Betts, playing under the pseudonym ""A H Chequer"", derived from his membership of the Harrow Chequers club, collected the ball after a long dribble from Walpole Vidal and slammed home.
Goalkeeper was not yet a specialist position, with keepers regularly playing outfield.
The historian's view: ""It was not unusual for teams to line up with six or seven forwards in the early 1870s. Most teams at this time still relied primarily on individual dribbling, with team-mates backing up the dribbler in an effort to move the ball towards the opponents' goal.
""Some authorities have claimed that the Royal Engineers were the first team to develop a passing game, and were doing so at around the time of the first FA Cup final.""
It's fair to say that the footballers of Oscar Wilde's age were a different breed to today's sporting stars.
The Wanderers' band of ex-public schoolboys and the aristocratic elite produced some notable sportsmen. As well as the pioneering Alcock the team contained several men who played first-class cricket, a goalkeeper who was capped by England as a defender and a forward who was capped by England in goal.
Forward Edward Bowen was noted for walking the 90 miles between Cambridge and Oxford in 26 hours in between his football and playing cricket for Hampshire; full-back Edgar Lubbock went on to become the deputy governor of the Bank of England and wing-wizard Walpole Vidal - known as the ""prince of dribblers"" - would later become a vicar.
As you would expect, the Royal Engineers side had all seen military service from across the world, with experiences branching from India to the Crimea, Bermuda, Gibraltar and the Zulu war.
Forward Henry Waugh Renny-Tailyour played football and rugby union for Scotland as well as cricket for Kent and would still find time to become a managing director of Guinness, while half-back Alfred Goodwyn would suffer the unfortunate fate of being the first international footballer to be killed in a riding accident in India two years after the final.
The historian's view: ""Most of the players in the first final had learnt the game in elite public schools and at university. The Wanderers was open only to those who had attended leading public schools and Oxbridge. Three of the Cup final line-up had attended Eton and four had gone to Harrow.""
The early rules were very different. In a nod to cricket, players had to appeal for a goal and changed ends after each goal, not at half-time. This once allowed Walpole Vidal to score three times without the opposition touching the ball.
The historian's view: ""Modern fans would be surprised by some of the features of football in 1872. Rather than a crossbar, a tape was pitched between two posts eight feet above the ground.
""Throw-ins were not determined by the team whose player had kicked the ball off the pitch but by the first player to reach the ball. But these rules were not consistent across the country. Variations existed in different areas and it was not until 10 years later, in 1882, that a uniform set of rules was established by the FA.""
The 2015 final will be refereed by Jon Moss, who can expect some grief from the stands. It was a different story for civil servant Alfred Stair, the referee chosen for the first three FA Cup finals. Stair was the head of the Inland Revenue - presumably seen as a trustworthy gentleman of his day - and also played football for Upton Park.
The historian's view: ""In the earliest days of football, referees were literally peripheral figures. They stood outside the playing area and were only called upon to adjudicate if the umpires (who were appointed by each club and stood in either half of the pitch) could not reach agreement.""
For winners Wanderers it was the start of a golden - if brief - era of success. They retained the trophy in 1873 by beating Oxford University 2-0 and added three more trophies before the end of the decade. Their haul of five FA Cups has only been bettered by Blackburn Rovers, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester United and Arsenal.
But by 1881 Wanderers could not field a side as players left to play for some of the newer clubs springing up across the country and the team folded in 1887. A reformed side was founded in 2009 and the club currently play in the Surrey South Eastern Combination. In fact they are looking for a new manager to get the club back in the FA Cup by 2022.
The Engineers reached four finals and won the Cup in 1875. They continue to play on and are currently managed by Capt Simon Mayers, who has a 25-man squad to select from around 8,000 men based around the world.
The historian's view: ""Football became increasingly popular over the next decade or so, as it became embedded in British working-class culture. Its popularity was helped by entrepreneurs who realised the opportunities that existed in enclosing playing fields and charging the public for entry.
""The next step from this, as teams began to act as representatives of their localities, was for ambitious club committees to 'poach' the best players and pay for them to play for their teams. Within less than a decade of the first FA Cup final, professional football had emerged in England, though it was not legalised by the FA until 1885.""",0

In just this past year, Gore burned through enough energy to power the typical American household for more than 21 years, according to a new report by the National Center for Public Policy Research. The former vice president consumed 230,889 kilowatt hours (kWh) at his Nashville residence, which includes his home, pool and driveway entry gate electricity meters. A typical family uses an average of 10,812 kWh of electricity per year, according to the U. S. Energy Information Administration.
Last September alone, Gore devoured 30,993 kWh of electricity.That’s enough to power 34 average American homes for a month. Over the last 12 months, Gore used more electricity just heating his outdoor swimming pool than six typical homes use in a year.
The National Center for Public Policy Research obtained the environmentalist’s energy usage information from individuals at the Nashville Electric Service, the utility that provides electricity to Gore’s home and much of Middle Tennessee.
In 2007, the day after Gore won an Academy Award for “An Inconvenient Truth,” I revealed Gore’s hypocritically high electric bills. In some months, I discovered, his residence gobbled up to 20 times more electricity than the average American household.
When Gore’s inconvenient truth became public knowledge, he promised to change his ways and gave his property a green makeover. Gore added 33 solar panels at a princely price tag of approximately $60,000. He also upgraded the home’s windows and ductwork, replaced the insulation, put in a driveway rainwater collection system, and installed a geothermal heating system.
The Nobel laureate also heroically went to the trouble of replacing his incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent ones.
In total, the renovation are estimated to cost well over $250,000.
But the home’s green facelift wasn’t enough to offset Gore’s colossal energy consumption.
Despite spending more than a quarter-million dollars on making his home more environmentally friendly, his energy consumption is higher than ever.
Those 33 solar panels generate about 12,000 kWh of electricity a year – way more than enough energy to power a typical American household. Gore is such an enormous energy hog, however, that his gigantic rooftop solar array produces just 5.7 percent of the electricity he uses in his home, or enough to power his home for a measly 21 days a year.
Gore also claims that his environmental sins are washed clean because he contributes to Green Power Switch, a scheme in which customers can donate extra money beyond the cost of their power bill to support green energy efforts. The money goes to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the source of NES’ electricity, to fund renewable energy projects.
Gore even told the “TODAY Show” that his home uses 100 percent renewable energy, but that is an outright lie.",1
"DETROIT - General Motors (GM) announced two more recalls Friday, pushing its total for the year to 71, affecting almost 30 million vehicles in North America.
The biggest of the new recalls covers just over 2010-2015 430,000 Cadillac SRX and 2011-2012 Saab 9-4X SUVs, mainly in North America. The company says some rear suspension nuts may not have been tightened properly. That could cause the toe link adjuster to separate from the suspension, possibly causing a crash.
Another covers the 2013-2015 Chevrolet Spark mini car because the hoods can unexpectedly fly open.
GM also confirmed Friday that it has told dealers to stop selling Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon midsize pickup trucks that went on sale about two weeks ago until an air bag problem is repaired.
The SUV recall covers SRXs from the 2010 through 2015 model years and Saabs from the 2011 and 2012 model years. GM says the problem has caused three crashes and two injuries.
Dealers will inspect the SUVs and install a new assembly if needed. Unsold SRXs are being checked to make sure the nuts are tightened properly.
The other recall covers nearly 94,000 Chevrolet Spark mini-cars from 2013 through 2015 in the U. S. and Canada. Rust can cause a secondary hood latch to stick, and the hood can open unexpectedly, blocking the driver's vision and causing a crash. GM says it knows of no crashes or injuries from the problem.
Dealers will replace the latch when parts are available. GM has told dealers not to sell about 13,000 cars on their lots until the repairs are made.
On the pickup trucks, spokesman Alan Adler said dealers nationwide were told Thursday to stop selling them because the air bags weren't wired properly at the factory in Wentzville, Missouri. A recall is pending. The company is still working on a remedy, which may be a software update, he said.
Most of the trucks remain on dealer lots or at the factory, but GM reported that it sold 47 last month, according to Autodata Corp. GM says that because of the problem, driver air bags won't work as designed.
GM is calling customers and sending out FedEx letters to notify them, and it's offering free loaner vehicles while repairs are being made. The company knows of no crashes or injuries from the problem.
The stop-sale order was first reported Friday by the trade publication Automotive News.
The new trucks are an important launch for GM, which is re-entering a market that Detroit had ceded to Toyota and Nissan. At an investor event this week, a GM executive said the company expects the trucks and the new Chevrolet Trax subcompact SUV to boost annual sales by about 200,000.
The spate of recalls, while troubling for the company, also shows a willingness to address safety problems quickly. GM was fined the maximum $35 million by U. S. safety regulators earlier this year for the delayed recall of 2.6 million older small cars with faulty ignition switches. The problem caused crashes that are responsible for at least 23 deaths. GM has admitted knowing about the problem for more than a decade yet it failed to recall the cars until February of this year.
General Motors Co. shares edged up 43 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $33.61 in midday trading Friday. Its shares had fallen almost 19 percent so far this year through Thursday's close.",0
"If You Try To Approach This Island, The Tribal People Will Murder You
The North Sentinel Island lives in the Bay of Bengal east of India’s coast. The island has been the home of the Sentinelese tribe for over 60,000 years.
During this time they have had little contact with the outside world and are violent and hostile towards outsiders. As a result, the Indian government has decided to cease further contact efforts with the Islanders and has enforced a 3 mile exclusion zone.
The island may appear to be an exotic paradise, however little is known of the mysterious island and its estimated population of 50 – 400 inhabitants.
The islands, roughly the size of Manhattan, is primarily made up of a forest like landscape. The tribe has demonstrated they have no interest in the modern world by being inhospitable to outsiders. In 2006, theSentinelese killed two men fishing close to the island.
They have been known to throw rocks and shoot arrows at planes and helicopters. This has prevented anyone from taking any high quality photos of the island.
Many still continue to venture either onto or close to the north Sentinel Island, even after it had become illegal to enter the 3 mile exclusion zone.",1
"Combination of local and national service ensures public television is available to virtually all DIRECTV subscribers
Washington, DC, December 20, 2001 - The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and the Association of Public Television Stations (APTS) have entered into an agreement with DIRECTV, Inc. for continued carriage of public television programming on DIRECTV, the nation's leading digital satellite television service. Through a combined local -into-local and national service arrangement, the multi-year agreement ensures public television programming is available to virtually all DIRECTV subscribers.
DIRECTV currently delivers local commercial broadcast networks in 41 metropolitan markets and provides the national PBS feed to its customers who subscribe to a local channel package. By year-end, DIRECTV will replace the national PBS feed with local public television stations in all 41 markets and DIRECTV customers in those markets who subscribe to their local channel package will receive their local PBS station(s). The agreement also provides for the continued carriage of the PBS national service in all other markets, subject to the consent of the stations serving those markets.
""We are committed to ensuring that local public television stations' valuable programming and education services reach all Americans through every form of distribution,"" said Pat Mitchell, PBS President and CEO. ""This groundbreaking agreement, which calls for a combination of local station and national service, guarantees that virtually every DIRECTV subscriber has access to our programming. We applaud DIRECTV for making this important commitment to serving the public interest.""
""This agreement is a major step for ensuring that locally-controlled public television stations will be available to as many communities as possible,"" said John Lawson, President and CEO of APTS. ""This agreement means that DIRECTV subscribers can count on receiving public television's valuable programming and services. This is a triple win for DIRECTV, for public television, but most importantly for the American public.""
""With access to their local PBS station, our customers in our local channel markets will have access to programming that is most relevant to their lives,"" said Stephanie Campbell, senior vice president, Programming, DIRECTV, Inc. ""Our customers expect DIRECTV to continue to provide them with compelling and quality programming, and PBS more than meets that criteria.""
As part of the multi-year agreement, DIRECTV will continue to carry the PBS national service in non-local-into-local markets subject to the consent of the stations serving those markets. DIRECTV currently has the right to carry this service under a statutory license provided by the Satellite Home Viewers Improvement Act of 1999 (SHVIA), but this license ends December 31, 2001. The new agreement would permit DIRECTV to continue to carry the feed in areas where it is not carrying local broadcast signals until such time as DIRECTV begins providing a local broadcast package which would include the local public television station(s).
PBS is a private, nonprofit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation's public television stations. PBS uses the power of noncommercial television, the Internet and other media to enrich the lives of all Americans through high quality programs and education services that inform, inspire and delight. Two additional PBS services, PBS KIDS and PBS YOU (a lifelong learning channel), are also available to DIRECTV subscribers. More information on the PBS national satellite service will be available at PBS.org/satellite as of Dec. 21.

"A number of business owners in Northern Ireland have been involved in aggressive tax avoidance schemes, an investigation by the BBC's Nolan Show has revealed.
Sam McCrea MBE and his wife, Julienne, are owners of Springfarm Architectural Mouldings Ltd (SAM Mouldings) in Antrim.
The couple were involved in a Mauritian tax avoidance scheme.
The McCreas have said they have fully complied with their tax obligations.
Over a quarter of the people signed up to that scheme were from NI.
The Paradise Papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.
The 13.4 million documents were passed to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
The Nolan Show team worked alongside colleagues in BBC Panorama, the Guardian and nearly 100 media organisations worldwide.
In 2000, SAM Mouldings bought land from Stormont's Department of Enterprise for 280,000. The company built their business on the site. By 2014, the property, with its factory and offices, was valued on its balance sheet at 4m.
But the following year, SAM Mouldings gave the multi-million pound property away for just one pound to what the company described as an 'unconnected third party'. The beneficiary was a company in Mauritius.
Documents seen by the Nolan Show reveal that the McCreas had control of the Mauritian company - they had given the multi-million pound property to themselves in all but name. The couple were listed as 'investment advisors' to the company - but the leaked files suggest they were doing much more than just advising.
At one stage, Sam McCrea wrote to the company in Mauritius questioning why a payment was made without his or his wife's permission.
He asked how the company could make any payments without the approval of the IA or 'investment advisor' - meaning either himself or his wife Julienne.
In other documents Sam McCrea advises that the Mauritian company buys shares from himself.
Since 2008, SAM Mouldings has received over 431,000 in financial assistance from Invest NI - who are a preferential shareholder in the company.
After the Antrim property SAM Mouldings operated from was given to the McCreas' company in Mauritius, SAM took on a 270,000 annual rent bill. This rent was sent through various intermediaries - and ended up in the McCreas' Mauritian company - where the income tax rate is just 3%.
This tax avoidance mechanism was promoted by the McCreas' tax advisors who set up the Mauritian scheme as a form of 'rent factoring' - that's where in exchange for a lump sum, a company diverts future rents from property to a financier.
Under this system, SAM Mouldings paid 270,000 annual rent to the Mauritian firm but Sam McCrea received a 200,000 loan from the firm. As a loan, it was not liable for tax.
Invest NI told the BBC in a statement that as part of their project monitoring and approval procedures of SAM Mouldings Ltd they ""were aware of the property transfer in question and this was taken into consideration when approving their most recent project.""
""SAM Mouldings has continued to grow in terms of both exports and employment targets and is meeting the agreed repayment schedule for the preference shares.
""A company's tax planning is a matter between it and HMRC. If it transpires that information provided to us as part of our approval process has been misleading and would have resulted in a different decision being made, we will review the specific case, as would be normal practice.
When asked about their involvement in tax avoidance schemes, the McCreas' lawyers said their clients ""are not going to enter into a course of correspondence concerning this sensitive and confidential funding arrangements of their business, with the BBC"".
They added: ""Our clients have fully complied with their obligations to HMRC, specifically with regard to the Mauritian companies.
They also said ""there will be no loss to the UK exchequer as a result of the Mauritian companies"".
They said the allegations were ""untrue, defamatory and are particularly unpleasant slurs on two people who have brought prosperity and employment to the Antrim area"", adding ""Mr McCrea holds a public honour for his services to business and he guards his reputation carefully"".

"CARDIFF, Wales (AP) — They came to see another explosive knockout from Anthony Joshua, the flattening of a 36-year-old journeyman opponent called up at 12 days’ notice to fight heavyweight boxing’s new superstar.
So when the referee moved in midway through the 10th round to stop Joshua administering more punishment to the game but beaten-up Carlos Takam, the 78,000-strong crowd made their feelings known.
Jeers rained down from all sides of the Principality Stadium on Saturday after Joshua’s 20th straight professional victory was sealed. He’d got through an uncomfortable fight with a busted nose and his WBA and IBF belts intact, but his army of fans wanted more.
“I think people wanted to see Takam unconscious on the floor,” Joshua said.
“My shorts and boots were white at the start and now they are pure pink,” he added. “It’s the ref’s job to allow the fighter to live another day.”
Fighting for the first time since beating Wladimir Klitschko in April, Joshua was unexpectedly taken beyond seven rounds for only the second time of his pro career as Takam — a veteran of 40 fights — lived up to his reputation as a tough, durable opponent.
The Frenchman, an injury replacement for Kubrat Pulev and giving up nearly 30 pounds (13 kilograms) to Joshua, took an eight count in the fourth round after toppling from a left hook and fought on with a cut above his right eye that twice required treatment. He absorbed some big shots and also had a cut over his left eye by the time Joshua caught him with a hook-uppercut combination in the 10th.
Joshua was moving in to land more blows when the referee stopped the fight. Takam shook his head in disgust and many in the crowd booed the decision.
“I don’t know why the referee stopped the match,” said Takam, whose name was cheered after the fight.
Joshua was fighting at the heaviest weight of his professional career — 254.8 pounds (115.6 kilograms) — and predicted a grueling slog against an experienced opponent that gets in close and works the body.
It got even trickier for Joshua when the fighters clashed heads in the second round, leaving the Briton with blood streaming from his nose.
Joshua looked frustrated at times, and even showboated in the seventh round by walking into Takam’s range with his arms out and head down, then shaking his head as Takam threw a punch. He was constantly talking to Takam, attempting to draw him in.
“I had to keep my cool,” Joshua said.
The win set up Joshua for a unification fight in 2018 with either WBO champion Joseph Parker or WBC champion Deontay Wilder, though initially he may need to face a mandatory challenger for the WBA belt.
Especially in Britain, Joshua has become a phenomenon, easily packing out big stadiums — there were 90,000 fans at Wembley against Klitschko, and almost as many at Cardiff on Saturday — but fighting in the United States, or maybe Africa or the Middle East, does interest him.

"Anthropologists from Russia have discovered thatNative Americans originated from Russia approximately twentythousand years ago.
The latest study conducted by a team of American and Russian scientists found that the descendants of the North American Indians who lived 5,000 years ago are still alive today.
This conclusion was made by researchers after comparing the DNA of fossils found on the northern coast of British Columbia in Canada and the living people who belong to the first several tribes from this area.
This discovery marks a very important step in the study of Indians, as scientists previously had only a trace of their ancestors. According to genetic research conducted by the University of Michigan, the ancestors of today’s Indians and Eskimos moved to America from northeast Asia through the so-called “Bering Bridge,” an ancient wide strip between America and Asia on the Bering Strait that disappeared over 12,000 years ago.
In turn, an international team of researchers that included members of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics with the Russian Academy of Sciences concluded that the genetic home of the first Americans was Altai. Approximately 20-25 thousand years ago, according to the scientists, the ancestors of the Indians came from there and settled in Siberia and eventually reached America. Genetic studies made a great contribution to the study of the history of Indians. Researchers found unique mutations present in the DNA of Native Americans known as a Q-line in the Y-chromosome of Altaians.
Subsequent studies have shown that nearly all modern Native Americans have in their pedigree traces of six women who crossed the Bering Strait about 20,000 years ago. It proved extremely difficult for the scientists to obtain more accurate data. After the colonization, the blood of European men often mixed with the blood of Indian women, resulting in the DNA from the genome in general and from chromosome Y (male sex chromosomes) containing a substantial part of European markers.
Today, however, the American scientists were able to solve this issue. To be able to investigate only the female part of the DNA that does not contain European markers, a molecular anthropologist at the University of Illinois and his colleagues chose to analyze the mitochondrial DNA contained in the egg and transmitted only through the maternal line.
For the purpose of the study, the researchers collected the DNA from sixty currently living people from the tribes of Tsimshian, Haida and Nisga’a on the northern coast of British Columbia. They compared the samples obtained with the mitochondrial DNA extracted from the teeth of four ancient human remains. Experimental skeletons o 6,000 years and 5,500 years old have been discovered near an ancient house on one of Lucy Islands in British Columbia. Another pair of skeletons used by the scientists in the study, age 5,000 and 2,500 years, was discovered on Dodge Island in British Columbia.
The results showed that the DNA of the three living representatives of Tsimshian and Nisga’a tribes matched the DNA from the skeleton found on Dodge Island. In addition, the study found that the DNA of three of the skeletons corresponded to at least one of the now living. The molecular anthropologist said that they found the ties that bound maternal lines from the mid-Holocene 5,000 years ago with the maternal lines of the descendants living today in Native American communities.
In turn, Jennifer Rehg, an anthropological geneticist at Northwestern University in Illinois who was not directly involved in the study noted that the finding of the two mitochondrial DNA in ancient humans and modern inhabitants of the north-west coast of America was of particular interest. “This suggests that there is continuity in the longest continuous settlement in this region,” Jennifer Rehg stated.
The curator of the Museum of Northern British Columbia, historian Susan Marsden noted that an important role in the further study of the genetic history of the region may be played by oral traditions of the Indians. “Stories of such communities were maintained in oral traditions that partially track matrilineal inheritance, and these stories suggest further migration in the region over the past 5,000 years,” said the historian.
Susan Marsden’s point of view is shared by her American colleagues from the University of Illinois. Currently researchers are conducting further studies to determine how the genetic history of the region crosses the line of oral histories of Indian tribes.
Legends about the origin of the fire, humans and animals took the central stage in the tales of the American Indians. Later myths about Cayman appeared in their culture. This was the patron of food, water, good spirits of plants, as well as inherent in all types of mythology tales of creation. When the Indians began to widely use maize in agriculture, a legend of a supreme female deity – “goddess with braids” – spread around. Interestingly, the goddess had no name. Scientists know only that the image of the goddess brings together the Indians’ idea about the spirits of plants and animals. The “goddess with braids” is also the personification of the earth, sky, and life and death.
Verbal stories of the Indian tribes have played a role in the study of Carl Gustav Jung and his successor Joseph Campbell, who were engaged in the study of the unconscious and the archetypes based on Native American myths.
In addition, many thoughts and ideas created by the Indians are widely spread today in the western society. For example, such sayings as “It does not require many words to speak the truth,” “When the last tree has been cut down, the last river poisoned, the last bird caught, only then will we realize that one cannot eat money.” “When you were born you were crying and everyone else was smiling. Live your life so at the end, you are the one who is smiling and everyone else is crying.” And, finally, to the question “What is life?” Indians replied: “It is the light of a firefly in the night. It is a breath of a bison when winter comes. It is a shadow on the grass dwindling at sunset.”
Without doubt, the study of historical and genetic relationships of Indian people is of great importance for modern science. Creating one of the most highly developed cultures, the Indians made a great contribution to the world civilization. The peoples of the world have adopted from the Indians cultivation of corn, potatoes, tomatoes, sunflowers, cocoa, tobacco, pepper, beans, peanuts, agave, beans, squash and other crops. No less significant is the contribution of the Indians to the spiritual treasures of human culture.",1
"Independent researcher CSOA, conducted a study of homosexuality and posted their surprising results over the weekend. According to their research, homosexuality is the single most contagious condition that exists on Earth.
The surprising findings by the CSOA showed that 100% of the homosexual adults who participated in the study, had some level of intimate contact with a member of the same sex. Joseph Tritha, who was the lead scientist in charge of the study, revealed that of the 100,000 gay adults who participated in the study, all had intercourse or extended levels of intimate kissing with members of the same sex. Based on those findings it is believed that homosexuality is passed through bodily fluids, including saliva, from infected parties.
Tritha stated, “of all the infectious conditions I have studied, this one is by far the most contagious. The Gay (the term used to identify the condition) is the most prevalent condition plaguing our society.”
“There is a 100% percent infection rate associated with this condition. Engaging in homosexual activity all but assures that you will catch The Gay,” he revealed.
The organization also conducted research on 100,000 heterosexual adults, and 100% of the subjects tested negative for The Gay.
The CSOA (Common Sense Organization of America) says to avoid catching “The Gay,” it is highly recommended that one refrain from having intimate relations with members of the same sex.
The condition has spread to every corner of the globe and there is no known cure, but theists believe the solution is to pray away The Gay. That particular method has shown no sign of promise, but theists remain hopeful that one day a cure will be found.
There is a one question survey to determine if you have contracted this condition.
Have you engaged in homosexual activity? If yes, you have The Gay.",1

SANTA ROSA, Calif. —The deadlywildfires devastating Northern Californiacontinued to spreadacrossdryhills and vineyards Wednesday, promptingmore evacuations from a menacing arc of flames that has killed at least 21 people, destroyed more than 3,500 buildings and battered the region’s renowned wine-growing industry. Officials expectthe death toll to rise as crews begin to reach heavily burned areas. Hundreds in flame-ravaged Sonoma County remain missing, and higher winds coupled with low humidity andparched lands could hamper efforts to contain the fires or create new ones. “We’re not out of the woods, and we’re not going to be out of the woods for a number of days to come,” Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott said at a news conference Wednesday. “We’re literally looking at explosive vegetation. These fires are burning actively during the day and at night.” What makes these fast-moving fires particularly dangerous, Pimlott said, is that they“aren’t just in the backwoods. ... These fires are burning in and around developed communities.” Nearly two dozen large fireshave been raging in the northern part of the state, sending thousands of residents to evacuation centers and burning roughly 170,000 acres— a collective area larger than the city of Chicago.That size is likely to grow. Pimlott said he’s worried that “several of these fires will merge.” “This is a serious, critical, catastrophic event,” he said.    [An elderly couple just celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary. Then the Napa wildfires came.]    The cause of the fires was unknown and likely to remain so for some time, officials said. “Trying to speculate on any cause is premature. At this point, it’s way too early to talk about it,”Pimlott said. “Primary efforts are stopping the fire and protecting lives.” Officials continue to order evacuations, including one Wednesday afternoon covering the entire city of Calistoga in Napa County. Sonoma County Sheriff Rober Giordano said crews had not been able to reach most of the areascalled “hot zones” that were immolated in the firestorm. When they begin searching those areas, “I expect that [death toll] to go up.” As of late Wednesday morning, 560 people in the county remain unaccounted for,Giordano said.It’s unclear if those who are still missing have been harmed, or are simply unable to reach friends and families, as fires have disabled much of the communication system in the region. Evacuation zones in Sonoma County will remain off limits, partly to limit the possibility of looting, which has resulted in several arrests. Giordano doubts residents will beallowed to return to their homes this week. “If you have a place to go, go; you don’t need to be here,” Giordano said, adding later:“I can’t stress this enough. If you’re in an evacuation zone, you cannot come home.”  Losses are equally grim in Mendocino County, where two fires had merged into one, and the death tollclimbed from two to six in the last 24 hours. “What’s irking people around here is the national news is only talking about Napa and Sonoma, and we’ve lost just as much here,” Alison de Grassi, spokeswoman for the Mendocino County Tourism Commission, told the San Jose Mercury News. “People have built their lives around these wineries and these ranches, and now they’re gone.” High winds that whipped up 22 large wildfires had faded Tuesday, and humidity increased, assisting an operation that has drawn resources from throughout the state and neighboring Nevada. But the sharp northern wind, known as a Diablo, soon returned, allowing only a brief window for firefighters to carve clearings in place to stop the fires from spreading tovulnerable populated areas. TheNational Weather Serviceexpects “red-flag” conditions — dry air and wind gusts up to 40 mph — to remain until Thursday in the North Bay Area, which includes Sonoma and Napa counties. More than 25,000 people have fled homes from seven counties north of San Francisco, filling dozens of shelters that state officials had hoped to consolidate in the coming days to provide more-efficient services. Many left houses with nothing, and officials acknowledged Tuesday that it could be weeks before some are able to return to what is left. In Sonoma County, 5,000 people have taken refuge in 36 shelters as of Wednesday morning, officials said.

(Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images)  The scope of the damage prompted President Trump on Tuesday to approve federal emergency assistance to California, agreeing to a request made by Gov. Jerry Brown (D). The declaration, announced by Vice President Pence during a visit to the state’s Office of Emergency Services near Sacramento, provides immediate funds for debris clearing and supplies for evacuation centers, among other aid. Brown cautioned that recovery would be very costly but seemed optimistic when asked Wednesday about the fires’ impact on California’s economy. The wine industry generates more than $55 billion in economic activity in California— and twice as much nationally — each year. “Overall California’s economy is very large, about $2.5 trillion ... The machinery of the markets grind on,” he said. “I don’t think you’re going to see a slowdown because of the fires.” The wildfires, which have already charred 8 million acres of land this year in California and much of the West, represents just one of 22 disasters the federal government is managing across the country, said Mike Cappannari, spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA. The agency has already deployed majority of its staff to help with a series of hurricanes that battered Texas, Florida and the Caribbean islands.  State officials said that firefighters planned toclear lines between the Atlas Fire and the city of Napa, and between the Tubbs Fire and the city of Santa Rosa — the largest in Sonoma County and gateway to the wine-tourism industry. Those barriers would protect the areas from the south with the expectation that winds will shift back to the north in the days ahead. Officials said the idea, in the case of the Tubbs Fire, was to prevent a “reburn” of Santa Rosa. On Wednesday,Ameir Kazemi stood in front ofwhat used to be his business and shrugged his shoulders in frustration. Mohawk Sign Company has been inSanta Rosa for 50 years; Kazemi has owned it for 10. Now it’s a pile of ashes and charred wood. Friends started calling his cell phone early Monday morning to tell him that his building was in flames, he said. But he decided to stay at home with his pregnant wife.Two hours later, TV stations began broadcasting images of his burning building, located in a strip mall with a gun shop.  “It was pretty sickening,”Kazemi said. “I just wanted to come see if there was any chance that anything survive — the artwork, 10 years worth of stuff on my hard drive. It’s all gone.” The disruption to daily life in a region known as a calm, sometimes intoxicating, tourist destination was immense. The 100,000 acres of vineyards — the focal point of California’s wine industry and the tourism business built around — remained threatened and, in some cases, damaged or destroyed. The extent of the damage was still unclear. More than a dozen schools were shuttered in the seven counties most affected by fires, and damage to the power grid meant that everything from charging cellphones to pumping fuel was curtailed. Nearly 80 cell towerswere damaged or destroyed, complicating efforts by even those with a charged battery to contact relatives or call for emergency assistance. The majority of those had been restored by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. The National Guard plans to bring in communications equipment to bolster the network, which state emergency officials called a priority.

"News: The inside story of the famous Iwo Jima photo
Why this photograph, and not the one of the arguably more meaningful first flag placement, which was taken by Staff Sgt. Louis R. Lowery? Its dynamic and masterful composition is part of the secret. The flag structures the picture, its diagonal back-leaning position contrasting with the forward motion of the soldiers. They seem to rise out of the ash and other detritus of the battlefield, and there is already something sculptural in their massed bodies, in their muscular legs and arms that strain to hoist up the heavy pole. The leg of the lead bearer crosses the flagpole, adding a further sense of solidity.
There is something deeply reassuring about this photograph in its display of strength and teamwork -- even the last man, who can no longer touch the flagpole, ""has the back"" of his comrades -- and its communication of a push forward to victory.
The fact we cannot see their faces also works to lift the image out of its original context, lending it a universal quality.
In Lowery's photograph, instead, the eye goes to the face of the wary sentinel, who guards the men who have almost completed their installation. The flag flies free and proud, and all of the soldiers are engaged intently in their task, but they are scattered around the frame. There is no one visual ""sweet spot"" in this image; it would certainly be harder to reproduce as sculpture.
The gun pointed outward reminds the viewer that this is a very dangerous mission. This photo does not reassure us, but rather makes us watchful. Ironically, this picture of a historic moment of planting an American flag on Japanese soil conveys the everyday jobs of war -- guarding, standing around -- while Rosenthal's, of a routine flag substitution, communicates an exceptional and heroic moment.
In truth, both images are necessary to convey the experience of Iwo Jima, which stands today as a notable case of daring strategies of amphibious assault (U.S.) and static defense (Japanese), examples of tenacity and teamwork, as well as failures of intelligence and devastating losses (on both sides).
What made Iwo Jima such a terrible battleground, even within the context of the many tough campaigns of the Pacific Theater? Its primary strategic importance for the United States was as an airbase and staging area for assaults on Tokyo, while the 8.5-square-mile island took on symbolic as well as strategic meaning for the Japanese as the first national soil to face foreign invasion.

The violence of this battle reflected the high motivation of most combatants, but also the particular circumstances of the island. Under the leadership of Lt. Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the Japanese prepared an extraordinary underground network of tunnels and caves in the semisoft sandstone, from which they would wage their war.
When the Americans landed, Kuribayashi allowed them to advance onto the beach, then opened fire; then, as the Japanese were firebombed out of their hiding places, the beach and environs became a dense killing field,, with hand-to-hand combat not uncommon.
The intensity of battle on Iwo Jima epitomized what author John Dower called ""the kill or be killed nature of combat in the Pacific."" For over a month, both sides endured, and saw, terrible things hourly, and yet their resolve only strengthened. The Japanese endured inhuman conditions underground, without food, water, and medical supplies, and their no-surrender policy created more unburied corpses in the tunnels as the war went on.
The Americans endured their own hell above ground, and the chaos of combat in a constrained space made friendly fire casualties higher than usual. Of approximately 20,000 Japanese soldiers, only about 2,000 survived the battle, while the Americans had over 20,000 casualties and 7,000 dead out of a total mobilized force of 70,000. Iwo Jima took an especially large toll on the Marines. One-third of the 19,000 who died during World War II perished on the island.
It is the very brutality of Iwo Jima that made Rosenthal's polished photograph so necessary and appealing. There is something Olympian about the image on top of the mountain, as opposed to the Japanese in their caves and the Americans their targets on the beach. The subsequent death of three of the flag-raisers in battle only made the photo more compelling as a representation of heroism on the island and as an abstract homage to camaraderie, strength, and determination in battle in general.
It is this perfection that contributed to the unfounded suspicion that Rosenthal's picture had been staged, and a campaign to restore Lowery's photo and the first flag-raisers to greater prominence. By then, the picture had been enshrined in the image bank relating to Iwo Jima and had taken on a life of its own, reproduced in sand, ice, and even Legos.
On this anniversary, we might remember both photos, for together they remind us that war is also waged, and won, in the small moments of mundane labor, in obscure airstrips and staging areas as well as major battlegrounds, and in the steady gaze and aim of the single sentinel. The two flags of Iwo Jima offer a lesson for today about the power of the media to shape our notions of what, and who, deserves to be remembered about war.

"(Before It's News)Scientists have identified patterns in the Earth’s magnetic field that evolve on the order of 1,000 years, providing new insight into how the field works and adding a measure of predictability to changes in the field not previously known.

The discovery also will allow researchers to study the planet’s past with finer resolution by using this geomagnetic “fingerprint” to compare sediment cores taken from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Earth’s polarity is not a constant. Unlike a classic bar magnet, the matter governing Earth’s magnetic field moves around. Geophysicists are pretty sure that the reason Earth has a magnetic field is because its solid iron core is surrounded by a fluid ocean of hot, liquid metal. The flow of liquid iron in Earth’s core creates electric currents, which in turn creates the magnetic field.
Results of the research, which was supported by the National Science Foundation, were recently published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters.
The geomagnetic field is critical to life on Earth. Without it, charged particles from the sun (the “solar wind”) would blow away the atmosphere, scientists say. The field also aids in human navigation and animal migrations in ways scientists are only beginning to understand. Centuries of human observation, as well as the geologic record, show our field changes dramatically in its strength and structure over time.
Yet in spite of its importance, many questions remain unanswered about why and how these changes occur. The simplest form of magnetic field comes from a dipole: a pair of equally and oppositely charged poles, like a bar magnet.
“We’ve known for some time that the Earth is not a perfect dipole, and we can see these imperfections in the historical record,” said Maureen “Mo” Walczak, a post-doctoral researcher at Oregon State University and lead author on the study. “We are finding that non-dipolar structures are not evanescent, unpredictable things. They are very long-lived, recurring over 10,000 years – persistent in their location throughout the Holocene.
“This is something of a Holy Grail discovery,” she added, “though it is not perfect. It is an important first step in better understanding the magnetic field, and synchronizing sediment core data at a finer scale.”
Some 800,000 years ago, a magnetic compass’ needle would have pointed south because the Earth’s magnetic field was reversed. These reversals typically happen every several hundred thousand years.
While scientists are well aware of the pattern of reversals in the Earth’s magnetic field, a secondary pattern of geomagnetic “wobble” within periods of stable polarity, known as paleomagnetic secular variation, or PSV, may be a key to understanding why some geomagnetic changes occur.
The Earth’s magnetic field does not align perfectly with the axis of rotation, which is why “true north” differs from “magnetic north,” the researchers say. In the Northern Hemisphere this disparity in the modern field is apparently driven by regions of high geomagnetic intensity that are centered beneath North America and Asia.
“What we have not known is whether this snapshot has any longer-term meaning – and what we have found out is that it does,” said Joseph Stoner, an Oregon State University paleomagnetic specialist and co-author on the study.
When the magnetic field is stronger beneath North America, or in the “North American Mode,” it drives steep inclinations and high intensities in the North Pacific, and low intensities in Europe with westward declinations in the North Atlantic. This is more consistent with the historical record.
The alternate “European mode” is in some ways the opposite, with shallow inclination and low intensity in North Pacific, and eastward declinations in the North Atlantic and high intensities in Europe.
“As it turns out, the magnetic field is somewhat less complicated than we thought,” Stoner said. “It is a fairly simple oscillation that appears to result from geomagnetic intensity variations at just a few recurrent locations with large spatial impacts. We’re not yet sure what drives this variation, though it is likely a combination of factors including convection of the outer core that may be biased in configuration by the lowermost mantle.”
The researchers were able to identify the pattern by studying two high-resolution sediment cores from the Gulf of Alaska that allowed them to develop a 17,400-year reconstruction of the PSV in that region. They then compared those records with sediment cores from other sites in the Pacific Ocean to capture a magnetic fingerprint, which is based on the orientation of the magnetite in the sediment, which acts as a magnetic recorder of the past.
The common magnetic signal found in the cores now covers an area spanning from Alaska to Oregon, and over to Hawaii.
“Magnetic alignment of distant environmental reconstructions using reversals in the paleomagnetic record provides insights into the past on a scale of hundreds of thousands of years,” Walczak said. “Development of the coherent PSV stratigraphy will let us look at the record on a scale possibly as short as a few centuries, compare events between ocean basins, and really get down to the nitty-gritty of how climate anomalies are propagated around the planet on a scale relevant to human society.”
The magnetic field is generated within the Earth by a fluid outer core of iron, nickel and other metals that creates electric currents, which in turn produce magnetic fields. The magnetic field is strong enough to shield the Earth from solar winds and cosmic radiation. The fact that it changes is well known; the reasons why have remained a mystery.
Now this mystery may be a little closer to being solved.
Walczak and Stoner are in Oregon State’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences. Other authors on the study are Alan Mix, also of OSU; John Jaeger, Gillian Rosen and James Channell of the University of Florida; David Heslop of Australian National University; and Chuang Xuan of the University of Southampton.",1
"As part of the continuing global backlash over the popular ride-sharing service, Uber and two of its senior European executives were convicted and fined nearly $500,000 in France on Thursday for running an illegal transportation business.
In its push to expand around the world, Uber, the fast-growing start-up that is now worth $62.5 billion, has become a target in many of the 300 cities where it operates. Traditional taxi drivers in France and other European countries have fought to restrict the company, saying that Uber does not comply with local rules and, in some cities, may represent a threat to public safety. The company denies these accusations.
The latest ruling in France — the result of a lengthy legal process that dates to early last year — relates to UberPop, the company’s low-cost service, in which drivers do not have professional livery licenses. After a series of strikes by the taxi unions and the banning of UberPop in France, Uber eventually suspended its low-cost service in the country last summer.
As part of the French judge’s ruling on Thursday, Uber will have to pay a fine of $906,000, though half of that figure was suspended. Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, the company’s head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Thibaud Simphal, Uber’s general manager in France, must pay an additional combined penalty of $28,500.
The two executives were convicted of deceptive commercial practices and complicity in operating an illegal transportation service. They were cleared of some related charges linked to privacy complaints.
“The judgment does not impact our service in France today — which now connects more than 12,000 professional drivers with 1.5 million passengers — but we will appeal,” Gareth Mead, an Uber spokesman, said in a statement on Thursday.

"The numerous “Boycott the NFL” movements have gained a tremendous following within the span of about a week — so big, in fact, that major corporate sponsors are now listening very closely to what ticked-off fans are saying.
Anheuser Busch has gone as far as hinting that that they’ve considered all possibilities when it comes to responding to angry football fans who are made at the NFL — including possibly pulling their multi-million dollar sponsorship?
Amidst the national anthem protests, one major sponsor is considering pulling their product from the NFL altogether: Anheuser Busch
The popular beer company is letting the public decide whether they should terminate their relationship with the NFL. This weekend, the beer company set up a hotline to get a better sense of what the public really thinks about the recent wave of protests.
Over the past couple of weeks, more than 150 players have refused to stand for the National Anthem. As a response, fans have been burning jerseys, throwing away season tickets, and game day ratings have plummeted.
Fans (or former fans) are angry. The hotline received such a high volume of calls that it crashed on Friday afternoon but is back up as of Sunday night.
The hotline greets fans with a brief statement:
If you are calling with questions or comments about Anheuser-Busch’s sponsorship of the NFL, press one. At Anheuser-Busch we have a long heritage of supporting the nation’s armed forces, veterans and military dependents. The national anthem is a point of pride for our company and for the 1,100 veterans that we employ. Please feel free to share your feedback after the tone.
At Anheuser-Busch we have a long heritage of supporting the institutions and values that have made America so strong. That includes our armed forces and the national anthem as well as diversity, equality and freedom of speech. We proudly employ over 1,100 military veterans and we work every day to create an inclusive environment for all of our employees. Because only together can we achieve our dream of bringing people together for a better world. We have many long-term sports partnerships, including our NFL sponsorship, and while we may not agree on everything, we still believe in the power of sport to bring people together and overcome their differences. Thank you.",1
"An American actor who’s appeared in movies starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Cruise has landed an unwitting role in a real-life thriller about the grinding struggle against graft in Europe’s most corrupt country.
Michael-John Wolfe, who makes personalized newscasts for birthdays and other events as a side gig, said he had no idea that a video he was paid to shoot suggesting Ukraine’s leading anti-corruption campaigner embezzled U. S. funds would be posted on YouTube and cited by opponents in Kiev as the real deal.
“I thought it was a prank,” Wolfe said by email, adding that he only knows the screen name of the person who hired him on Fiverr,an online marketplace where he charges $50 to orate 150 words. “I’ve been doing these newscasts since 2011 and never had a problem before. I apologize if anyone was hurt.”
With just 16,000 views, Wolfe’s video is the least of Vitaliy Shabunin’s worries. The founder of the U. S.-funded Anti-Corruption Action Center, whose work is critical to unlocking billions of dollars of aid for Ukraine’s cash-strapped government, has become a lightening rod for entrenched interests in a nation where runaway corruption sparked two revolutions in the space of a decade.
Shabunin, 32, has been under relentless pressure since March, months after an initiative he championed -- mandatory asset disclosures by officials -- came into force, angering everyone from prosecutors and politicians to tax authorities and even the security services.
The revelations of million-dollar bank accounts,mansions and luxury goods sparked outcryfrom a public that already considered rampant graft more menacing than Russia. Ukraine’s neighbor annexed Crimea from it in 2014 and continues to support a simmering insurrection in the industrial east that’s claimed 10,000 lives.
“They’re hunting us because we closely oversee the fight against graft and pressure the government,” said Shabunin, who’s served on the public council that monitors the anti-corruption bureau the government had to create under its $17.5 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund. A mission from the Washington-based lender will visit Kiev this month to assess, among other things, progress on tackling graft.
Shabunin, a former councilman from the western city of Rivne who’s at turns jovial and resolute, spoke in an interview in Kiev after another video surfaced that’s far more damaging than Wolfe’s fake newscast. It shows him finally losing his temper and punching a self-proclaimed independent journalist who’d been stalking him with a camera and trolling him online for months.
The June clip of the activist dropping the agitator,Vsevolod Filimonenko, with a quick right cross while wearing a backpack and clutching a sports jacket has been viewed 90,000 times. It’s now evidence in anassault probe that carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison.
“I hit a person who was haunting my team,” Shabunin told reporters after his Aug. 16 hearing. “I am prepared to bear responsibility for that.”
Shabunin’s supporters, including Semen Semenchenko, a lawmaker who’s fought against Kremlin-backed militias in the east, said it’s absurd that a crusader for clean government is facing jail time for striking a known extortionist. Before the uprising, Filimonenkowas fired from an election-monitoring watchdog in his native Luhansk, one of two regions now partly held by rebels, after he was recorded soliciting a $3,000 bribe from a local official.
Filimonenko, who managed to shoot Shabunin in the face with pepper spray after getting up off the floor, denies corruption back in Luhansk. While he doesn’t want Shabunin to go to prison, he said bloggers and journalists should be free to work and should receive compensation if they’re attacked and injured.
Filimonenkois an aide to Serhiy Melnychuk, a lawmaker who was stripped of his immunity for alleged ties to organized crime, which he denies. Semenchenko, who’s fallen out withMelnychuk in the past, said in televised remarks that Filimonenkoand his boss are “political hitmen.”Semenchenko says the pair do the bidding of the military’s top prosecutor, Anatoliy Matios, who was reprimanded for exceeding his authority by trying to draft Shabunin into the army.
Calls to Melnychuk’s office and staff went unanswered. Matios, who was also unreachable by phone and via Facebook, slammed Shabunin on the social network in July, calling him a “journalist-beating conscription-dodger.”
Shabunin was on his way to a military recruitment center when the altercation with Filimonenkooccurred. He was there to contest a draft order Matios’s office issued challenging a medical deferment that exempts him from army service, the potential pool for which was expanded after the rebellion erupted in 2014.
Three conscription officers and a camera crew showed up at Shabunin’s house to deliverthe summons on his daughter’s birthday in June, a week after his center filed a lawsuit challenging Matios’s decision to ban outsiders from viewing his and his staff’s asset declarations. Matios’s 2016 filing showed he owned multiple homes and had $600,000 in cash.
“The state isn’t fighting against corruption -- it’s fighting against those of us who are,” said Ruslan Ryaboshapka, a former official in the National Corruption Prevention Agency, the state body that oversees the declarations.
Ryaboshapka said he quit the agencya month after the European Union granted Ukrainians visa-free travel, in part as a reward for making progress on curbing graft. The waiver was a major victory for President Petro Poroshenko, who’s since shown little appetite for accelerating the cleanup.
Poroshenko, a candy billionaire whose approval rating has been as low as 4.4 percent, has yet to fulfill a pledge to sell his holdings. He made that promise three years ago during his campaign to replace Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia amid the popular uprising. Polls have shown almost 90 percent of the public views the fight against graft a failure and two-thirds are prepared for the kind of protests that brought down past governments.
The president’s press service declined to comment on the campaign against Shabunin, as did the Prosecutor General’s Office. In a move labeled revenge by activists, parliament in March imposed the same asset-declaration requirements on NGO staff as officials. Poroshenko signed the new rules into law.
The black ops against Shabunin began to intensify after the EU visa deal. TheAnti-Corruption Action Center accuses the State Security Service, or SBU, of tapping its employees’ phones and sharing their movements with people who’re either paid or coerced to harass them. It also says an SBU officer organized a protest outside his house on a Sunday morning in late April with placards making the same claims as Wolfe’s anonymous scriptwriter.
An SBU spokeswoman,Olena Hytlyanska, denied both allegations, saying by email that the service “doesn'thave the desire or legal grounds to get distracted by some ambitious politicians or civil activists.”
The U. S. Embassy in Kiev has come to Shabunin’s defense, saying via Twitter that the Anti-Corruption Action Center has accounted for every dollar of aid and that it’s “proud” to bethe watchdog’s partner. But that did nothing to dissuade tax authorities from continuing an investigation into the group’s finances.
“We’re the main obstacle to rolling back anti-graft reforms,” Shabunin said in the interview. “So authorities are seeking to discredit us, to undermine our support among Ukrainians and the international community.”",0
"Gasoline futures jumped to a four-month high and oil dropped as flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey in Texas led to the shutdown of major refineries.
Motor fuel prices rose 2.7 percent and oil in New York slipped 2.7 percent. Harvey, the strongest storm to hit the U. S. since 2004, has flooded cities and caused plants to shut, leading to about 2.26 million barrels a day of crude and condensate capacity in Texas offline.Several key pipelines were also closed, potentially stranding crude in Texas and interrupting gasoline supplies to other parts of the country.
“There’s a big drop-off suddenly in crude oil demand,” John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, said by telephone. “We have a supply disruption event in gasoline production. Gasoline demand in the balance of the country is still elevated, so we could see a real impact on gasoline inventories if these refineries are unable to get restaffed quickly.”
Harvey’s widespread flooding has interrupted refining operations, leading plants such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s Deer Park, Texas, refinery and Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Baytown, Texas, complex to shut. Meanwhile, Magellan Midstream Partners LP suspended its inbound and outbound refined products and crude pipeline transportation services in the Houston area and Colonial Pipeline Co.’s Cedar Bayou, Texas, operations are shut. Several energy traders closed their offices Monday and Houston’s utility said restoring power would take at least until Sept. 2.
Gasoline for September delivery climbed 4.57 cents to settle at $1.7123 a gallonon the New York Mercantile Exchange after touching $1.7799 a gallon, the highest intraday pricefor a front-month contract since July 2015. The gasoline crack spread, a rough measure of the profit from refining crude into gasoline, rose to $19.42 a barrel.

West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery slipped $1.30 to settle at $46.57 a barrel, the lowest level in five weeks. Brent for October settlement dropped 52 cents to end the session at $51.89 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $5.32 to WTI, the widest in two years.
An estimated 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day of oil output from the Eagle Ford shale formation in Texas has been shut, according to the Texas Railroad Commission. At the same time, about 19 percent, or 331,400 barrels a day, of Gulf of Mexico oil production is offline, compared with 22 percent Sunday, according to government data.
Other infrastructure outages includeExplorer Pipeline Co.’s suspension of its product shipments from origin points in Pasadena, Texas, and a service halt by Magellan on the Longhorn and BridgeTex crude pipelines.
The U. S. could see 30 percent of refining capacity shut on Harvey and if the storm moves up the Texas coast toward Louisiana, then additional shutdowns could occur in Port Arthur and Beaumont in Texas as well as in Lake Charles, Louisiana, Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. LLC analysts said.
The storm has drifted back into the Gulf of Mexico and is poised to regain strength before crashing into the Texas-Louisiana border, according to the National Hurricane Center. While two refineries in the Corpus Christi, Texas, area are said to be preparing for restart, other plants on the Gulf Coast are still closed with the potential shutdown of more in the Port Arthur area, including the nation’s largest refinery operated by Motiva Enterprises LLC.
“Clearly, the storm is having much more of an impact on the refined product side than it is on the production side for oil and gas,” TamarEssner, an energy analyst at Nasdaq Inc. in New York, said by telephone. There is uncertainty about what type of potential flood damage could have occurred at these refineries or how long they will be offline, she said.
* Houston offices of energy traders Trafigura Group Pte Ltd., Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. and Gunvor Group Ltd. are closed Monday and staff are working from home or elsewhere following flooding caused by Tropical Storm Harvey, according to company spokesmen.
* From a global oil supply-demand perspective, the storm is likely to lead to higher crude and product inventories over next couple of months “given the likely larger hit on U.S. demand than supply,” according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
* Cushing crude stockpiles rose by 200,000 barrels last week, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.
* Two more oil fields inLibyaare being closed after an armed group took over pipelines to both deposits, further disrupting the OPEC nation’s plan to boost crude production.

"Despite the fact that it has been a massive failure, Michelle Obama is still incredibly proud of her school lunch plan, as she sees it as her biggest accomplishment as the first lady. That’s why it came as devastating news to the former first lady when she heard that her advisor on her school lunch program David Binkle busted for corruptionas part of her school lunch program!
He was an adviser to Michelle Obama on her infamous and regularly criticized school lunch program. Binkle, a chef by trade, served for years as the health food guru for the Los Angeles Unified School District. He was held up as the poster child for the first lady’s program, instituting its strict nutrition standards for the nearly 1 million children the Los Angeles school district feeds a day. Binkle was so successful in instituting the program that he was brought to the White House to meet with the first lady and advise her on new ways to implement restrictions on children’s lunches.
The Los Angeles Unified School District serves nearly 700,000 meals per day, and the professional chef helped lead a charge that saw vegetarian curries, pad Thainoodlesand quinoa salads replace old cafeteria staples like chicken nuggets and corn dogs.
The initiatives won the district numerous awards, drew praise from then-First LadyMichelle Obamaas she led a national push to combat childhood obesity, and earned Binkle appearances on Tedx Talks.
But as he was revolutionizing meals for the district’s students, prosecutors allege, Binkle illegally funneled roughly $65,000 of the district’s money into a private consulting firm he ran, then placed some of that money into his own pocket.
The 55-year-old appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to 15 felony counts including embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds. He posted $220,000 bail and is scheduled to return to court in October.
According to court documents, Binkle repeatedly misappropriated district funds in amounts ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 between 2010 and 2014. Prosecutors also allege that he forged an application to become a vendor with the district and failed to disclose outside financial interests.
If convicted, he faces up to 13 years in prison.
Michelle, who may or may not have known this was going on, has been silent since the seedy truth of her program has come out and it’s unlikely she’ll address it anytime soon, if ever. She has more important things to publicly discuss that serves her ego instead of the need for justice being served on poster child for her program.
Luckily her pet project, telling all Americans how to eat, is over. President Trump has ordered the Food and Drug Administration to hold off indefinitely on Michelle’s changes to all labels on foods and on menus in restaurants. It was due to take effect in 2018, but now, it’s all been scrapped and thrown in the dustbin.
What do you think should she answer for this?

"This year’s 2016 USA Olympic team included 18 military athletes.They represented all four major services: Army (14); Navy (2); Marines (1); and Air Force (1).
The sports in which they competed included a total of 15 different events: six track and field; five shooting; and four others.
The six track and field events included: 100-dash; 5,000- and 10,000-meter races; pole vault; 3,000-meter steeple chase;
The five shooting events consisted of air rifle; double trap shotgun; three-position prone rifle; 50-meter prone rifle; and the 25 meter rapid fire pistol.
And finally, there was one athlete on each of a rowing team member, 100-meter breaststroke, recurve bow (archery), and the modern pentathlon. The pentathlonconsists of fencing, swimming, equestrian show jumping, cross-country running and pistol shooting.
Two members of Team USA won medals. Army Spc. Paul Chelimo won the Silver Medal in the 5,000-meter race and Army 2nd Lt. Sam Kendricks won the Bronze Medal in the Pole Vault.
Two servicemembers participated in the 2016 Paralympic Games. Army Staff Sgt. Michael Lukow won a Bronze Medal for the recurve bow event and Army Sgt. Elizabeth Marks swam the 100-meter breaststroke but did not medal.
However, Marks did make her mark by winning medals at the 2016 Invictus Games in early July, 2016.
The Invictus Games are an international Paralympic-style multi-sport event, created by Britain’s Prince Harry, in which wounded, injured or sick armed services personnel and their associated veterans take part in sports including wheelchair basketball, sitting volleyball, swimming, and indoor rowing. Named after Invictus, Latin for “unconquered” or “undefeated” the event was inspired by the Warrior Games, a similar event held in the United States. The first Invictus Games took place in 2014 at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, United Kingdom.
Sgt. Marks is one tough combat medic. In 2010, she received a bilateral hip injury while serving in Afghanistan. And she nearly died in 2014 from a respiratory infection. It was so severe that she was forced into a medically induced coma that lasted almost two months in a London hospital.
But she won four Gold Medals at the Invictus Games for various swimming events. And she gave one of her medals to Prince Harry, asking him to give it to members of the Papworth Hospital staff who saved her life.
If I just had one medal I would have given it to that hospital.”
She went on to describe the various hospitals she had been in while recovering from her infection.
Explaining on why it was important for her to donate her medal, Marks explained:
Of course, Prince Harry’s country, the UK, saved my life, and saving my life meant a great deal to me. I’ve known Prince Harry since the Warrior Games in 2013, but I wanted to be able to shake his hand and thank him for all his country had done for me.”
Army Sgt. Marks, Spc. Paul Chelimo, 2nd Lt. Sam Kendricks, and all of the other servicemembers of Team USA made America proud with their participation in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil this year.",1

Democrat Chris Hurst, left, and Republican Joseph R. Yost. (Jay Westcott /For The Washington Post)      — Chris Hurst checks the dark clouds out the window of his Jeep Liberty as he barrels west up Route 460 to the crest of Brush Mountain. Rain starts, big drops, promising a heavy storm. Hurst hurtles down the far side, finds the gravel lot he’s looking for and pulls off the road. He scrambles out of the car, determined to get a picture before the rain gets too intense. “How about that,” he chuckles, centering the image on his iPhone: a giant billboard reading “Giles County for Hurst. Vote Nov.7th.” It’s solid red country over here, so Hurst — running for the Virginia House of Delegates as a Democrat — is making a bold statement with that sign. Just up the road is a huge banner depicting the Ten Commandments and the American flag, and beyond that a billboard with a bloody cross and the slogan “Hang out with Jesus. He hung out for you.” This is home turf for his opponent, Del. Joseph R. Yost, a Republican who has represented the 12th District since 2011. One of the youngest members of the General Assembly, Yost is from an old pioneer family and chairs the local historical society. In a state where all the races are serving as proxies for partisan wars in Washington, the 12th is a key battleground — targeted by Democrats as one that can be flipped from Republican control, a beachhead in a region that once seemed untouchably red.   After his girlfriend was murdered on live television in 2015, Chris Hurst left behind a career as a local news anchor in hopes of becoming a delegate for Virginia’s 12th District in the state legislature. Democrats believe hecould flip the competitive seat. (Dalton Bennett,Whitney Shefte/The Washington Post)   Hurst is a political novice, but a local celebrity with a tragic backstory. He was the anchor for the evening news two years ago when reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward were gunned down on live TV by a disturbed former colleague. Parker and Hurst had been living together with plans to marry.  [They planned to marry; then a gunman stole their future on live TV]  His surprise decision this year to quit TV and run for office electrified the local race. He has raised the second-highest amount of all Democratic challengers in the 100 Virginia House races — $232,000 as of the June reporting period. Republicans are funneling cash to Yost to keep up, raising $210,000. Their district is as polarized as any in the state — one side of Brush Mountain voted for Donald Trump last fall and the other for Hillary Clinton. But at the center of all that attention and pressure, Hurst and Yost are doing something interesting — something that suggests Washington's hyperpartisan toxicity doesn’t have to play out at every level: Rather than withdraw to ideological extremes, they are converging toward the middle, staking out similar positions on many issues. Both are opposed to the huge natural gas pipeline proposed for the county. Both want to protect manufacturing jobs, support public schools and create better mental-health services. Yost won the endorsement of the Virginia Education Association — almost unheard of for a Republican. Hurst, the gun violence survivor, touts his support for gun rights. And neither is a big fan of President Trump.   Chris Hurst, Democratic candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates, speaks with Sue Elliott, left, while canvassing a neighborhood in his district on July 18, 2017, in Blacksburg. (Jay Westcott/For The Washington Post)   Hurst’s version: “If there was a party that was just the No B. S. party, I’d be a charter member.”   From the outside, it would be easy to make assumptions about the 12th District. It is part of the red backcountry, the edge of Appalachia, home to the working-class whites who helped put Trump in office. Except it’s more complicated than that. The crest of Brush Mountain is the line between Giles and Montgomery counties. Virginia Tech and Radford University are on the Montgomery side, which is economically diverse with upscale neighborhoods full of professors and business leaders. Occasional modest “We love our Muslim neighbors” signs can be spotted on the shady streets of Blacksburg. In Giles, where the biggest employer is a factory that makes cellulose acetate and other materials for filtration devices, many of the little towns — Pearisburg, Narrows, Rich Creek, Newport — are struggling, their business districts darkened by empty storefronts. In terms of natural beauty, though, Giles is wealthy beyond measure. The Appalachian Trail winds through the county for 50 miles, some of it along the spectacular New River Gorge. The 69-foot Cascade Falls draws nearly 150,000 visitors every year. Those resources produce a pragmatic environmentalism among locals. There was little objection a few years ago to a natural gas pipeline for the Celanese plant, for instance, because it eliminated the factory’s coal waste and supported jobs. But the proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline is just passing through on its way to Pittsylvania County and draws almost universal outrage in both Giles and Montgomery. During last fall’s presidential election, the Giles side of the district went heavily for Trump while the Montgomery side went largely for Clinton. With its bigger population, Montgomery tipped the overall district into the Democratic column — but only by about 500 votes out of more than 30,000 cast, according to an analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project. That edge is why Democrats think they can pick up the district this year, with blue voters especially motivated to defy the party of Trump. That, and the fact that Hurst looks like a rising star.  Hurst just turned 30 but has the bearing of a much older man. He had to develop his anchorman gravitas early, winning the big chair at WDBJ in Roanoke when he was only 22. The station touted him as the youngest anchor in the country. It was something Hurst had been preparing for since his childhood in the Philadelphia area. He and his dad built sets at their house so he could stage talk shows, and he did newscasts on his high school’s public-access TV channel. He came to Roanoke in 2010, not long after graduating from Emerson College. Parker joined the station in 2015. As they fell in love their careers consumed them, but they took refuge in hiking and kayaking across the region. Her death made headlines worldwide. She was interviewing a local economic development official on live TV when a former reporter at the station showed up and shot her, cameraman Ward and the official, Vicki Gardner, who survived. The shooter posted his own video of the killing online before being hunted down by police and killing himself. Parker was 24, Ward was 27. Hurst was on the air soon after, talking of his relationship with Parker. He went on living in the apartment they had shared and kept up daily phone calls with her father, who had become outspoken about guns and mental illness. Somewhere in those discussions, as Hurst struggled to find meaning, the idea of running for office came up. After months of weighing it with his family, Hurst made the break in February. He said farewell after an evening newscast, announced that he was running for office as a Democrat and moved to a basement apartment in Blacksburg with his dog.  Many people assume Hurst is running on the issue of gun control. The Pride Fund to End Gun Violence hosted him at an event in Washington last month, along with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ralph Northam — rare recognition for a candidate in an obscure state district race. But Hurst’s position is not what advocates on either side may think. He’s a gun owner, he said; Parker liked to shoot, too. He’s leery of steps to broadly restrict access to guns. Instead, he favors measures to treat mental illness and keep guns out of the hands of children or domestic violence offenders. Even the standard Democratic call for universal background checks is too broad, he said: “I’m just not as matter-of-fact, black or white with guns as I think people expect or want me to be.” Guns are a nuanced issue in the district. Hunting and shooting are part of growing up here, but so is the memory of the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, in which a mentally ill student shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17.  Hurst would much rather talk about raises for teachers, or his opposition to the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The need for more mental-health services. Better special-education programs. Unsexy topics that don’t make the national news but that people in the community wrestle with every day. What he learned from the depths of his personal tragedy, he said, is the importance of place. “I came through the other side believing that I wanted to stay here and give back to the people who gave me such strength and support when I needed it,” he said.   Yost, the Republican incumbent, has faced opposition before but never someone so high-profile or well funded. If it worries him, he doesn’t show it. At 31, Yost, like Hurst, seems mature for his years. He’s quiet in the General Assembly, seldom making speeches. With his round, tortoiseshell glasses and scruffy facial hair, Yost comes across as a young history professor. He grew up on a farm in Giles County, went to the public schools and graduated from Radford with degrees in criminal justice. “I’ve never lived outside the boundaries of my district,” he said. Much of what he has done since jumping into politics in 2011 is rooted in local concerns that don’t follow easy partisan patterns. Yost worked in criminal justice for a time, in jail diversion and crisis intervention training — helping the mentally ill get treatment instead of incarceration. In the legislature this year, Yost sponsored bills to prohibit the death penalty for the severely mentally ill and to study ways that people in jail can get Medicaid services immediately upon release. The first stalled in committee; the second was signed into law. He has also sponsored legislation to make it legal to farm hemp in Virginia — which would help struggling farmers — and favors increased education spending. In rural areas, he said, schools do much more than teach; they’re community centers. But Yost is most definitely a Republican. He’s a loyal rank-and-file vote for the party’s majority in the House of Delegates and thinks that government should have limits. It’s his conservative outlook, and maybe his polite demeanor, that make him hesitant to even talk about Trump. “Federal issues don’t have the impact here they do in other parts of the state,” Yost said. “Trump doesn’t come up. We talk about our issues.” And more than anything, that intense local focus is Yost’s secret weapon in the race against his hyper-articulate challenger. He has spent years grinding away at small-bore constituent services.  He and his aide scour the community columns in local newspapers for birthdays, anniversaries, awards, kids bagging their first buck — and Yost sends that person a copy of the article with a hand-signed note of congratulations. Dozens, every month. During the school year, he writes to every student who lands on the A/B honor roll — all 1,500 of them. “I have great strength in my arm,” he deadpanned. In the evenings, knocking on doors for votes, Yost sees the benefit of that unglamorous work. “I had won the award and you sent me a letter, for the community service,” said Pearisburg resident Connie Richardson, 66, when Yost asked for her support. “And I really appreciated that.” Neighbor Scott Clark, 50, a state trooper, has known Yost most of his life and doesn’t think much of Hurst coming from Roanoke to run. “He kind of is a carpetbagger,” Clark said. “Which I think you’d probably hear echoed in most [places]. You might not in Blacksburg, but you’d probably hear it over here. ... There’s a pretty fine dividing line. We don’t like to be like Blacksburg, and I’m sure they don’t like to be like us.”  On the other side of Brush Mountain, Hurst stumped for votes in a Blacksburg neighborhood — sweat-stained handkerchief in his back pocket, clipboard listing voter names, a tin full of Altoids. He doesn’t feel like an outsider, he said. Roanoke is only 30 minutes away; this was all part of his TV market. But he’s quick to point out to people who come to the door — and they all recognize him — that he lives in town. Hurst is ready for anything when he meets voters like this. Some have burst into tears, thinking back to the tragedy with Parker, perhaps conscious of Virginia Tech’s tragedy, as well. “I’m a trigger for some people,” he said. At one house, two retired nurses told Hurst that they miss seeing him on TV. “Well, I know I’m sweatier and not as made-up in person,” he said. “Just here more to listen than anything else. That’s what I used to do at the TV station as a reporter, and that’s what I hope to do as a delegate, too — listen to what’s on your mind.” The two women — Gayle Robertson, 71, and Lynn Juliano, 63 — gave him an earful about their dislike of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. But beyond that, they said, pausing to find the words, things are just discouraging. “Just watching what’s going on up in Washington,” Juliano said. “You know, the health care, and just ... anyway, things are not going the way I would like things to go.”  Hurst nodded. “You know, I was in an environment where I could let cynicism keep creeping in and feel like I was powerless to make direct change,” he said. “And instead I took a leap without a safety net to do something that I’m passionate about.” “You did, yeah, you did,” Juliano said, and she and Robertson pledged their support. With that, Hurst was off to the next house. He has knocked on thousands of doors — with volunteers, more than 10,000, including over the mountain in Giles. Hurst isn’t willing to write off that part of the district, thus the billboard on the highway. But the morning after the billboard went up, a small red sign appeared in front of it: “Re-elect Joseph Yost — Delegate.” Another was just up the road, and another, and another — marching deeper into Giles County.",0
"Monday, 27 June was a quiet night for the Icelandic television stations that were not showing Euro 2016.
As about 150,000 viewers tuned in to watch their team's remarkable win over England in the last 16, nothing else in the schedules got a look-in.
Icelandic TV channels not showing the England game attracted just 298 viewers between them.
That, perhaps, is an extreme example of how a major football tournament can bring a nation together.
It is also one of a series of weird and wonderful statistics generated by the tournament.
It felt at times like a dull tournament - and the stats back it up. The new, enlarged tournament produced 108 goals - an increase of 32 from four years ago - but at an average rate of 2.12 per game; the lowest average for a European Championship since 1996 (2.06).
* Iceland were the only team to score in each of their games at Euro 2016 (five games, eight goals in total)
* Ukraine were the only team who failed to score
* France were the top scorers with 13 goals, and only France themselves have scored more in a single edition of the tournament (14 in 1984)
* Despite attempting 56 shots more than their opponents at Euro 2016 (82-26), England scored as many goals as they conceded (four)
* More than half of the goals scored in the tournament were scored by just six teams - France, Wales, Portugal, Belgium, Iceland and Germany
* Germany completed 3,574 passes during the tournament, as they enjoyed an average possession rate of 67.2%. At the other end of the scale Northern Ireland managed just 640 passes - 47 more than Germany midfielder Toni Kroos
He may have ended this tournament injured and in tears, but Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo emerged as a champion. He scored three goals in France and is certainly persistent. Spare a thought for Germany forward Thomas Muller though. He just cannot score in the Euros.
* Ronaldo has mustered 122 shots at Euros finals, more than twice as many as any other player since 1980 (Thierry Henry - 52). He has now attempted 43 direct free-kicks at major tournaments but has failed to convert a single one
* By scoring against Hungary in the group stage, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four different European Championship finals tournaments (2016, 2012, 2008 and 2004)
* Germany's Thomas Muller is without a goal scored in 11 matches at European Championship finals. In contrast he has scored 10 goals in 13 games at the World Cup
* Muller had 44 touches in the opponents' penalty area - more than any other player
As mentioned at the top of this article, a staggering 99.8% of Iceland's television viewers watched their country beat England.
Across the continent, though, Euro 2016 matches rated consistently highly.
* More than 130 broadcasters showed matches across more than 230 nations
* The combined worldwide TV ratings for the tournament was 6bn
* The live average audience per match was more than 130m
* More than 200m people worldwide watched the opening match between France and Romania - a 30% increase on the corresponding fixture at Euro 2012
* In the UK, a peak audience of 13.6m watched the Euro 2016 final on BBC One, with 2.7m tuning in on ITV
Television executives often talk about 'audience share' - the total percentage of viewers watching a particular channel. Euro 2016's audience share was high, with the best viewing figures across various countries as follows:
* UK: England v Iceland (ITV: 15m - 59.1%). The combined share for the final across BBC One and ITV was 59%
England matches at major international tournaments draw in enormous audiences in the UK. England's Euro 2012 quarter-final defeat by Italy, which was live on BBC One, attracted an audience of 20.3m viewers.
Euro 2016 has been a significant financial success for Uefa, as the figures show:
* Compensation paid to clubs for their player participation: 150m euros  (128m)
Uefa has calculated that the tournament will have a significant economic impact in France, stating that:
* 25,000 full-time jobs have been created as a result of the tournament
* 20,000 additional jobs were created for the construction and renovation of stadiums in the build-up to the tournament
* 100,000 people were employed specifically to work at Euro 2016",0
"Trucking holds a special importance in the American economy. More than two-thirds of the nation's freight--some 10.5 billion tons of goods--is transported by truck, a feat that requires 3.5 million drivers and nearly as many heavy-class trucks. In 29 states, truck driving is themost common job.
But that might not be the case for long, as the potential savings from automating trucks are too tempting for the industry to ignore.
Trucking companies lose a whopping $49.6 billion annually due to congestion, according to the American Trucking Association. Moreover, driver error is at least partly to blame in about 90 percent of the more than 4,000 deaths and 10,000 injuries attributed to trucks and buses every year. There also is a driver shortage currently estimated by theATA at 50,000 positions. In less than a decade, the trade group expects nearly 900,000 will be needed.
""Autonomous vehicle technology is real, folks, and it's here whether we like it or not,"" said ATA President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Spear in his 2016 ""State of the Industry"" speech before the trade association's annual conference. ""This technology has the potential to get trucks moving, reduce fuel burn and emissions and increase miles driven -- all measurable returns to drivers.""
Truck manufacturer Peterbilt, which is part of PACCAR (PCAR), and Daimler's Freightliner are among the makers of 18-wheel tractor-trailers that are developing autonomous technology. Earlier this summer, Peterbilt agreed to build test trucks using the technology developed bytech startup Embark. Freightliner Inspiration, the first licensed autonomous commercial truck to operate on an open public highway in the United States, made its debut a few years ago at the Hoover Dam.
Cummins, which has been synonymous withdiesel engines for nearly a century, last week unveiled an electric semi, a month ahead of Tesla's (TSLA) plans to do introduce a similar vehicle. Elon Musk's company is engaged in a high-stakes battle with Alphabet (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL), among others, over self-driving technology.
""You have prototypes out there that are pushing the envelope,"" he said. ""Essentially, the technology that drives the Tesla applies to any other vehicle. It's just trucks are a lot more complicated because they have trailers and more axles and have a lot more weight.""
Not surprisingly, the Teamsters Union, which represents about 600,000 commercial truck drivers, is leery of self-driving technology and is calling for comprehensive federal rules regarding autonomous vehicles, including strong minimum safety standards.
The union also argues that raising wages for truckers, who earn a median salary of $41,000 a year, would go a long way toward solving the labor shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 18 percent of workers in the transportation and warehousing industries are represented by unions. About a quarter of truckers are not employees at all, but independent contractors.
""We have concerns about the technology and our number one priority ... as a union is the safety of our members and the driving public,"" said Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokeswoman. ""Our position is there needs to be a full understanding of what the risks are and limitations as well as the potential with automated technologies.""
But while the government ponders regulating the sector, money is pouring in--and fights are breaking out. Last year, Uber acquired start-up Otto for $680 million. Otto, whose technology powered the first commercial delivery by an autonomous truck, was founded by a former Google employee. Google's parent company, Alphabet -- which is also developing self-driving technology--is now suing Uber, alleging trade secrets were stolen. (The former Googler, Anthony Levandowski, has sincebeen fired.)
As with autonomous cars, experts say trucks able to operate without any human intervention at all are years away. But technologies that combine automation with human drivers are all around. The human driver of the Otto-powered truck, for instance, sat in the sleeper berth at the back of the cab without touchingthe vehicle's controls. Though Ford (F) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are testing driverless cars to make pizza deliveries in the pizza chain's Ann Arbor, Michigan, headquarters, the Ford Fusions that will deliver them will be manually driven by a Ford safety engineer and staffed with researchers.",0
"On a chilly winter day in Midland, Mich., Fritz Schmidt walked into a hair salon to get his annual extreme makeover -- as Santa Claus. After a few hours of bleaching his hair and beard, Schmidt was a dead ringer for jolly old St. Nick.
""I first started when my daughter was born. She'll be 28 this year,"" said Schmidt, a 60-year-old semi-retired agricultural salesman.
Schmidt said his transition to Santa was an enjoyable one because he loves children and this is one job where they are your main clients.
""You gotta have a good heart, and you have to believe yourself, because the kids can see through it if you're just there just for the sake of being there,"" Schmidt told ""20/20.""
That's just one of the many mantras Schmidt learned at Charles Howard Santa School in Midland.
The Santa School was founded 75 years ago by former Macy's Santa Charles Howard and is the oldest Santa Claus Training Academy in the world, boasting more than 3,000 graduates.
""We have between 90 and 115 Santas attend every year and somewhere between eight to 20 of them are Mrs. Claus,"" said Holly Valent, who's been running the Santa School for 25 years with her husband, Tom.
The school for mastering the spirit of Father Christmas is so popular that there is a waiting list every fall.
""I tried for five years to get into this school,"" said Rick Hyman, who's been a Santa since 1972. ""This without a doubt is the most exciting time that you'll ever experience in this life of being a Santa Claus.""
This Harvard of the Santa Schools, as it has been called, costs more than $400 and spans three days in October. The school offers instruction and fine tuning for returning students.
""They cover everything from bad breath to your beard and how to maintain your hair,"" said Schmidt. ""They teach sign language, too.""
The school brings in a trainer from the local gym to help Santas stay in good shape, a must for picking up hundreds of children per day, and the training is not complete without perfecting the all important ""ho ho ho.""
""They even brought in an attorney whose primary emphasis was to make sure that you had both hands in every picture,"" said 64-year-old Ray Davis, a land surveyor who's been doing Santa for eight years.
""You have to watch the way you handle the children,"" said Tom Valent, dean of the school. ""If you're gonna sit them on your knee, keep your hands exposed so people and the cameras can see them.""
Across the U. S. this holiday season at least 70,000 Santas are suiting up at malls, parades, company parties and other venues. These Santas are part of a growing number of office workers and retirees looking to make extra money to supplement their income.
On average, many Santas can make between $20,000 to $50,000 during the holidays, and a few lucky ones rake in $80,000 or more. That's a good thing, because authentic Santa outfits can cost north of $2,000, and black boots are going for $400 these days.
Aside from the attire and the lessons from the Santa School, most Santa students agree that the appearance of the hair and beard is key.
Schmidt and Davis get theirs done at Sue Myers beauty shop in Midland.
""The beard needs to be a very soft white,"" said Myers, who has bleached and coiffed the curls of some of the finest Santas in the land for 15 years. ""The color has an illusion, and if you have dark hairs in there, it looks dry or wiry.""
Myers shared with ""20/20"" her biggest secret: peppermint oil. Just a touch for Santa's beard.
""It makes Santa smell like a candy cane for the children,"" said Davis.",0
"A chief Israeli Rabbi has called for the mass executions of all Palestinians, calling on Tel Aviv to commit the mass-genocide instead of arresting them and “leave no one alive” in order to establish safety in occupied Palestinian territories.
RabbiShmuel Eliyahu posted a message on his Facebook page, sayingthat the “Israeli army has to stop arresting Palestinians … but, it must execute them and leave no one alive“.
Aschief rabbi of the city of Safed, Eliyahu is known for his racist behavior and remarks about Arabs and Muslims. He had earlier urged the Israeli regime to take“revenge” against Arabs in order to restore what he called Israel’s deterrence.
He also described Palestinians as the enemy of Israel and claimed that they “must be destroyed and crushed in order to end violence.”
“If they don’t stop after we kill 100, then we must kill a thousand. And if they do not stop after 1,000, then we must kill 10,000. If they still don’t stop we must kill 100,000, even a million,” the Jerusalem Postquoted him as saying in 2007.
In 2012, he was charged for making racist statements as he called the Arab culture “cruel” and accused Arabs of having “violent norms” which “have turned into ideology.”
Eliyahu alleged that Arabs steal farm equipment belonging to Jews and blackmail farmers.
“The minute you make room for Arabs among Jews, it takes five minutes before they start to do whatever they want,” he purportedly said.
However, the Israeli Justice Ministry dropped the charges against him, claiming that reporters ‘may’ have changed his statements.
Back in December, the Jerusalem Post quoted Eliyahuas saying, “Should we leave them (Palestinians) alive in order to then free them in another gesture to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas? The fact that they still have a desire to commit …attacks shows that we are not operating strongly enough.”
On his Facebook page, he also called for the prosecution of those Israeli forces that keep Palestinians alive, saying,“We must not allow a Palestinian to survive after he was arrested. If you leave him alive, there is a fear that he will be released and kill other people… We must eradicate this evil from within our midst.”
The comments come as tensions have been running high across the occupied Palestinian lands in recent months over Tel Aviv’s imposition of restrictions on Palestinian worshipers’ entry into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East al-Quds (Jerusalem) in August last year.
More than 160 Palestinians, includingwomen and children, have been killed by Israeli forces since the beginning of lastOctober.",1

The First Time America Freaked Out Over Automation
It was the late 1950s, and the problem was solved quickly. But the same strains beneath the surface still haunt us.
In 1958, America found itself in the midst of its worst economic slump since the Great Depression. There had been other recessions, from 1948 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1954, but they were less severe. The latest downturn, which began in the summer of 1957, turned serious by winter. In January 1958, Life magazine visited Peoria, Illinois, and found the mood there to be gloomy. Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker and the big provider of jobs in town, had already laid off 6,000 workers and cut back to a 4-day week. “Trouble is already here for some people,” said one Caterpillar worker. “But it’s under the surface for everybody.”
In Peoria and across the nation, things got steadily worse. By July, the national unemployment rate hit 7.5 percent. General Electric alone had sent home some 25,000 production workers by the summer of ’58; General Motors, 28,000. Things got so bad for Studebaker-Packard, the automaker, that it made a shocking announcement: It would no longer honor its pension obligations for more than 3,000 workers, handing an “I told you so” moment to those who’d been warning about the fragility of retirement promises.
As painful as the recession was, to many it was all part of the natural business cycle: a chance for manufacturers to pare down inventories that had become bloated earlier in the decade, to pull back on investments that had gotten overbuilt and to adapt to a shrinking export market. The Committee for Economic Development, a liberal-leaning business group that had been started toward the end of World War II to promote job creation, called it “one of the long series in the wave-like movement that has been characteristic of our economic growth.” Kenneth McFarland, a consultant for General Motors, agreed. “What we have now is normalcy,” he said. “The law of supply and demand—the free enterprise system—is working now as it was supposed to work.”
But some suspected that something else was going on, something structural and not just cyclical. The Nation termed it an “Automation Depression.” “We are stumbling blindly into the automation era with no concept or plan to reconcile the need of workers for income and the need of business for cost-cutting and worker-displacing innovations,” the magazine said in November 1958. “A part of the current unemployment … is due to the automation component of the capital-goods’ boom which preceded the recession. The boom gave work while it lasted, but the improved machinery requires fewer man-hours per unit of output.” This conundrum, moreover, would outlast present conditions and become even more apparent in an economy that was supposed to accommodate 1 million new job seekers every year. “The problem we shall have to face some time,” the Nation concluded, “is that the working force is expansive, while latter-day industrial technology is contractive of man-hours.”
Decades later, many of the same concerns have resurfaced. The impact of automation on jobs has become one of America’s most pressing economic issues. In industry after industry—food services, retail, transportation—the robots are coming or already have arrived. Most factory floors, once crowded with blue-collar laborers, emptied out long ago because of technology; what once took 1,000 people to manufacture can be cranked out these days by less than 200.
Many economists remain confident that a sufficient number of new jobs will emerge, lots of them in fields we can’t yet imagine, to replace all of those positions that automation will kill off. But even so, this much is certain: Many Americans, especially people with limited education and skills, are going to be displaced by machines over the next 10 to 20 years. And as a country, we’re not very good at training and retraining and preparing the most vulnerable for a new future. In the meantime, our national politics have been totally upended, with Donald Trump having played on people’s anxieties and swept into office on the pledge of bringing back millions of those same lost jobs.
Whether Trump’s rhetoric is grounded in reality is a different matter. Consider, for instance, the Carrier factory in Indiana, where Trump boasted in November he had saved 1,100 jobs. The CEO of the heating and air-conditioning manufacturer later admitted that many of those positions would ultimately be replaced by automation anyway. (The kicker: The company recently announced that it was moving 632 of those jobs to Monterrey, Mexico.)
That we are still trying to figure out how to cope with the ramifications of technology on employment is, at least in part, a function of how the government, business and labor unions dealt with the crisis back in the 1950s—or didn’t, as history would have it. Instead, the public and private sectors were reassured by the return of the booming economy less than a year later. And so a longer, more structural solution to the cracks that had just begun showing never materialized, leaving the question for another day. Our day.
Even in the 1950s, angst about what automation would mean for employment was not new. Economists started to explore the issue in the early 1800s, during the Industrial Revolution. Most classical theorists of the time—including J. B. Say, David Ricardo and John Ramsey McCulloch—held that introducing new machines would, save perhaps for a brief period of adjustment, produce more jobs than they’d destroy. By the end of the century, concern had faded nearly altogether. “Because the general upward trends in investment, production, employment and living standards were supported by evidence that could not be denied,” the economic historian Gregory Woirol has written, “technological change ceased to be seen as a relevant problem.” But fears reappeared in the mid-to-late 1920s, as America experienced two mild recessions and newly published productivity data indicated that machines were perhaps eating more jobs than was first believed. “This country has upon its hands a problem of chronic unemployment, likely to grow worse rather than better,” the Journal of Commerce, a trade and shipping industry publication, opined in 1928. “Business prosperity, far from curing it, may tend to aggravate it by stimulating invention and encouraging all sorts of industrial rationalization schemes.”
The key word was “may.” Economists continued to investigate the matter, but reliable statistics were scarce, and no firm conclusion was reached. Through the late 1930s, scholarly opinions about technology’s net effect on employment were as divergent as ever. World War II then put the entire debate on hold. But by the 1950s, it was revived again with the stakes seemingly higher than ever, thanks to all the technological advances that had been made by the military and industry during the conflict.
The world was in the throes of what MIT mathematician Norbert Wiener called “the second industrial revolution.” And to many, the outlook for employment was suddenly forbidding. “With automatic machines taking over so many jobs,” the wife of an unemployed textile worker in Roanoke, Virginia, told a reporter, “it looks like the men may have finally outsmarted themselves.” Said the Nation: “Automation … is a ghost which frightens every worker in every plant, the more so because he sees no immediate chance of exorcising it.” Science Service, a nonprofit institution, remarked: “With the advent of the thinking machine, people are beginning to understand how horses felt when Ford invented the Model T.”
Corporate executives largely dismissed these worries, maintaining through the 1950s and 60s that for every worker cast aside by a machine, more jobs were being generated. Sometimes, whole new enterprises sprang to life. “The automatic-control industry is young and incredibly vigorous,” John Diebold, dubbed “the prophet of information technology,” told business leaders in 1954. Mostly, the argument went, job gains were being realized at the very same companies where new technology was being deployed, as huge increases in output led to the need for more workers overall—office personnel, engineers, maintenance staff, factory hands—to keep up with rising consumer demand. General Motors, for example, added more than 287,000 people to its payroll between 1940 and the mid-1950s. “There is widespread fear that technological progress … is a Grim Reaper of jobs,” GM vice president Louis Seaton told lawmakers. “Our experience and record completely refutes this view.”
No company, however, pressed this point harder than did General Electric, which was at the fore of automating both its factories and offices: In 1952, it installed an IBM 701 to make engineering calculations at its Evendale, Ohio, jet engine operation. And in 1954 GE became the first company to use an electronic computer for regular data processing, when it bought a UNIVAC I to handle accounting, manufacturing control and planning at its appliance division in Louisville, Kentucky. “Machines that can read, write, do arithmetic, measure, feel, remember, now make it possible to take the load off men’s minds, just as machines have eased the burden on our backs,” GE said in one ad. “But these fantastic machines still depend on people to design and build and guide and use them. What they replace is drudgery—not people.”
By the late 1950s, GE was offering another justification for its rush to automate: Its overseas rivals, having pulled themselves out of the rubble of World War II, were on the rise. “We have strong competition from highly automated foreign plants paying wages that are only a fraction of ours,” said Charlie Scheer, the manager of GE’s lamp-equipment unit. “It’s a case here of automate or die on the competitive vine.” To illustrate the peril, GE showed a film called Toshiba to its factory workers in New Jersey, highlighting the Japanese company’s inroads into the lamp market. The move backfired, however, when the International Union of Electrical Workers discovered that GE had been investing in Toshiba since 1953, amassing a nearly 6 percent stake in the company. “The purpose of this film is obviously to brainwash you into believing that low-wage competition … is a threat to your job security,” the IUE told employees. “What GE failed to tell you is that it likes to play both sides of the street at the same time.” The union labeled GE’s warnings “phony propaganda.”
GE wouldn’t back down, however. “Automation is urgently needed,” Ralph Cordiner, the company’s CEO, testified to Congress, “to help individual companies, and the nation as a whole, try to be able to meet the new competition from abroad.” More generally, he added, the claim that automation strangled job growth was patently false. “The installation of labor-saving machinery may—and should—reduce the number of persons required to produce a given amount of goods and services,” Cordiner said, “but this increase in efficiency is precisely what creates both the attractive values and additional ability to support expanded output, new industries and new services for an ever more diverse economy.”
In the broadest sense, he was right. A study by University of Chicago economist Yale Brozen would find that while 13 million jobs had been destroyed during the 1950s, the adoption of new technology was among the ingredients that led to the creation of more than 20 million other positions. “Instead of being alarmed about growing automation, we ought to be cheering it on,” he wrote. “The catastrophe that doom criers constantly threaten us with has retreated into such a dim future that we simply cannot take their pronouncements seriously.”
But Brozen was too blithe. While automation may have added jobs in the aggregate, certain sectors were hit hard, playing havoc with untold numbers of individual lives. Technological upheaval caused both steelmakers and rail companies, for instance, to suffer drops in employment in the late 1950s.
“In converting to more automated processes, many industries found it less costly to build a new plant in another area rather than converting their older factories, thus leaving whole communities of employees stranded,” the Labor Department said in one study of the period. In the mid-1960s, the federal Commission on Technology, Automation and Economic Progress would recognize technological change as “a major factor in the displacement and temporary unemployment of particular workers.”
Labor leaders like Walter Reuther of the United Auto Workers and James Carey of the Electrical Workers, cognizant that they couldn’t afford to be seen as Luddites, went out of their way to praise the manifold benefits brought by machines. “You can’t stop technological progress, and it would be silly to try it if you could,” Reuther said. The UAW had already conceded the point in 1950 when, as part of its landmark five-year contract with General Motors, known as the Treaty of Detroit, it had formally agreed to take a “cooperative attitude” regarding the forward march of technology. Carey likewise said that automation, along with atomic energy, “can do more than anything in mankind’s long history to end poverty, to abolish hunger and deprivation. More than any other creation of man’s hand and brain, this combination can create a near-paradise on earth, a world of plenty and equal opportunity, a world in which the pursuit of happiness has become reality rather than a hope and a dream.”
Then, in their very next breaths, both Reuther and Carey would condemn business for not doing enough to temper automation’s ill effects. “More and more,” said Reuther, “we are witnessing the often frightening results of the widespread introduction of increasingly efficient methods of production without the leavening influence of moral or social responsibility.” With industry having failed, according to Reuther and Carey, it was up to Washington to become much more active in assisting workers idled by machines. They called, among other things, for federal officials to develop more effective retraining programs and relocation services for displaced workers, beef up unemployment insurance and establish early retirement funds, and create an information clearinghouse on technological change to help steer national policy.
For all of the union men’s denunciation of corporate America, many companies did try to help workers whose jobs were taken out by technology. The integrity of the social contract at the time demanded as much. Kodak, for instance, left millions of dollars on the table in the late 1950s by holding off on installing more efficient film emulsion–coating machines; by waiting five or so years to make the complete upgrade, the most senior workers who would have been forced out were allowed to reach retirement age. “In this case,” Kodak reported, “substantial dollar savings were delayed in order to cushion the effect of mechanization on some of the company’s most skilled, experienced and loyal technicians.” Other corporations focused on improving their workers’ skills. Some 30,000 General Motors employees were enrolled in various training programs in the late 50s, for example. At General Electric, veteran workers laid off because of automation were guaranteed during a retraining period at least 95 percent of their pay for as many weeks as they had years of service. “This was an effort to stabilize income while the employee prepared for the next job,” said GE’s Earl Willis. “Maximizing employment security is a prime company goal.”
Still, given the pace of change, it didn’t take a lot to imagine a day when it wouldn’t really matter what companies did to soften the blow of automation. This would become all the more true in the aftermath of the greatest invention of 1958 (and one of the most significant of all time): the computer chip. Then again, having a vivid imagination didn’t hurt, either. Kurt Vonnegut tapped his to write his first novel, Player Piano, published in 1952. In it, he renders a future society that is run by machines; there is no more need for human labor. Early on in the book, the main character, an engineer named Paul Proteus, is chatting with his secretary, Katharine:
“Do you suppose there’ll be a Third Industrial Revolution?”
Paul paused in his office doorway. “A third one? What would that be like?”
“I don’t know exactly. The first and second ones must have been sort of inconceivable at one time.”
“To the people who were going to be replaced by machines, maybe. A third one, eh? In a way, I guess the third one’s been going on for some time, if you mean thinking machines. That would be the third revolution, I guess—machines that devaluate human thinking. Some of the big companies like EPICAC do that all right, in specialized fields.”
“Uh-huh,” said Katharine thoughtfully. She rattled a pencil between her teeth. “First the muscle work, then the routine work, then, maybe, the real brainwork.”
“I hope I’m not around long enough to see that final step.”
Vonnegut, who worked at GE in public relations from 1947 through 1950, had found his muse in building 49 at the company’s Schenectady Works. There one day he saw a milling machine for cutting the rotors on jet engines. Usually, this was a task performed by a master machinist. But now, a computer-guided contraption was doing the work. The men at the plant “were foreseeing all sorts of machines being run by little boxes and punched cards,” Vonnegut said later. “The idea of doing that, you know, made sense, perfect sense. To have a little clicking box make all the decisions wasn’t a vicious thing to do. But it was too bad for the human beings who got their dignity from their jobs.”
As the recession of 1958 deepened, the Eisenhower administration undertook a series of actions to stimulate the economy: It quickened the rate of procurement by the Defense Department, stepped up the pace of urban-renewal projects on the books, cut loose hundreds of millions of dollars of funds for the Army Corps of Engineers to build roads and other infrastructure, and ordered Fannie Mae to add extra grease to the housing market. The Federal Reserve did its part, too, cutting interest rates four times from November 1957 to April 1958.
Some wanted the government to do even more; the Committee for Economic Development, for instance, called for a temporary 20 percent cut in personal income taxes. But President Dwight Eisenhower was reluctant to go that far. Instead, he publicly endorsed efforts by business to jumpstart things on its own. “What we need now,” the president quoted a Cadillac dealer in Cleveland as saying, “is more and better salesmanship and more and better advertising of our goods.”
Many apparently agreed. In Grosse Ile, Michigan, a supermarket owner offered any customer who spent five bucks or more in his store a chance to win a sack of 500 silver dollars. In Hampton, Iowa, seven firms gave their employees surprise bonuses on the condition that they spend the money on nonessential items. Some sought to shake up consumer psychology. A Cleveland realtor hoped to revitalize home sales by accentuating the positive on new signage: “Thanks to you our business is terrific.” In Kankakee, Illinois, local businessmen tried to turn residents from economic pessimists to optimists by staging a mock hanging of “Mr. Gloom.” The epitaph on his tombstone read: “Here Lies Mr. Gloom Killed By the Boom.”
General Electric also tried to change the national mindset. “A swift and sure recovery cannot be attained by sitting back and relying on government stimulants, deficit spending, meaningless tax cuts, deliberate inflation, or any other economic sleight of hand,” Ralph Cordiner told GE shareholders at the company’s annual meeting in April 1958. “The solutions to the present difficulties will be found in a common effort by all citizens to work more purposefully, buy and sell more confidently and build up a higher level of solid, useful economic activity.” GE called its slay-the-recession initiative Operation Upturn, and the idea was to get every company in America to focus harder than ever on providing its customers with just what they were looking for. “I am not speaking only of sales campaigns or promotional stunts, although they will be important ingredients in the whole picture,” Cordiner said. “Nor do I mean a transparent attempt to persuade people to buy things they don’t want simply because it is supposed to be the ‘patriotic’ thing to do so. I am proposing a total effort, by every man and woman who has a job, to concentrate on giving customers the best service and the best reasons to buy they ever had.”
At GE, Cordiner worked to turn the pep talk into policy. General Electric held down prices and extended new terms of credit in order to help consumers who’d been laid off from their jobs. GE’s marketers kicked into overdrive, too. “They are reviving the old-fashioned shoe-leather selling that creates business where it does not now exist,” Cordiner said. “They are pointing out extra value and features in our products. They are selling hard.”

It’s impossible to know just how big a difference was made by GE’s Operation Upturn and the other efforts by business to resuscitate the economy, but this much is undeniable: the recession of 1957–1958 didn’t last long. The decline was sharper than the recessions of 1948–1949 and 1953–1954, but so was the rebound. The downturn was officially over in just eight months, compared with 10 months and 11 months for the other two postwar contractions. The stock market also soared in 1958—proof, said Time magazine, that “the US was blessed with a new kind of economy, different from any ever seen on the face of the earth.” It was one that “could take a hard knock and come bouncing quickly back,” where businessmen could face the “inevitable williwaws of economic life but continue to plan and expand for the long term,” while workers found “overall employment more stable.”
But this business-led crusade to avert a bigger economic crisis meant that Washington failed to seize on a bold course to counter the forces behind the “Automation Depression” of the 1950s. In the coming decades, federal officials would implement a host of measures aimed at giving workers supplanted by technology new skills: the Manpower Development and Training Act, the Economically Displaced Worker Adjustment Act, amendments to the Job Training Partnership Act and more. But most experts agree that this legislation has not been very effective. Nor are most job programs geared to help people enhance the essential human qualities—such as empathy and creativity—that they’ll need to work side by side with smart machines.
“The United States does not have a good record of constructive policy response to technological unemployment,” Alice Rivlin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a recent article. “America’s failure to pay serious attention to those left behind by technological change,” she added, “is arguably responsible for much of the public outrage on both right and left that erupted in the 2016 election.”
With half of the nation’s adult population lacking any kind of education beyond high school, not even so much as a post-secondary certificate, it is tough to envision that this outrage will subside anytime soon. After all, these folks, in particular, face a stark truth: that most any job that can be given to a machine will be, and that machines’ capabilities are improving by the day.

"WASHINGTON, Oct. 28—
Congress has passed a major immigration bill that would increase legal permanent immigration to the United States by more than 35 percent, and White House officials said today that President Bush was eager to sign the measure.
The most notable feature of the bill is that it requires the State Department to admit more immigrants with job skills needed in the United States, a step long favored by free-market economists.
The number of visas granted on the basis of job skills, to workers and their relatives, would more than double, to 140,000 a year from 54,000.
But the increase implies no reduction in the number of immigrants admitted on the basis of family relationships. The number of such ""family-sponsored immigrants,"" now 436,000 a year, would increase to 465,000 a year through Sept. 30, 1994, and would then rise to 480,000.  Section Defeated by Hispanics
Under the bill, total immigration to the United States would initially increase 40 percent, to 700,000 from the current level of about 500,000. The ceiling would drop to 675,000 in 1995.
Those figures do not include refugees, who are admitted to the United States after showing ""a well-founded fear of persecution"" in their homelands. Mr. Bush has authorized the admission of up to 131,000 refugees in the current fiscal year, up from 125,000 last year.
The landmark immigration bill was passed late Saturday, a few hours before the 101st Congress ended. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus staged a brief revolt and forced the bill's sponsors to remove a section permitting several states to test more secure means of identification. Hispanic-American groups generally oppose the idea of a national identification card and resist any step that might lead to such a document.
Representative Bruce A. Morrison, Democrat of Connecticut, chief sponsor of the legislation in the House, said that Republicans who wanted to test the use of more secure identification documents quickly agreed to drop that section of the bill. Worker Shortages Expected
After complaining about an earlier version of the bill, which would have allowed higher immigration levels, the White House threw its support behind the legislation in the last few weeks.
The President's top domestic policy adviser, Roger B. Porter, said the Administration ""strongly supports"" the compromise measure because it would help relieve labor shortages and would contribute to economic growth in the 1990's.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said: ""Numerous studies suggest that the long-run benefits of immigration greatly exceed any short-run costs. With projections of a rising demand for skilled workers in coming years, the nation can achieve even greater benefits from immigration by augmenting the traditional emphasis on family reunification with policies designed to increase the number of skilled immigrants.""
Lawmakers said immigrants could, for example, fill job openings for scientists, engineers, computer specialists, nurses and medical technicians. Many Government and private researchers have concluded that there will be labor shortages in such areas in the 1990's. They see immigration -- the admission of permanent immigrants, not temporary workers -- as a way to correct the mismatch between labor supply and demand.  Two Groups Singled Out
Hispanic groups support a section of the bill that provides 55,000 visas in each of the next three years for spouses and children of aliens who gained legal status under a 1986 law.
Another part of the bill, strongly supported by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, would make available up to 16,000 visas in each of the next three years for Irish citizens.
Some critics, including Doris M. Meissner, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, say such provisions are reminiscent of ""national origins"" quotas that discriminated in favor of white Europeans. But Mr. Kennedy said the provisions were justified to increase the diversity of immigration.
""We are trying to level the playing field,"" Mr. Kennedy said, noting that eight countries now receive 52 percent of all immigrant visas. Influence of Immigrants
Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean now account for most legal immigration to the United States. Europe, which dominated such immigration from colonial times to the 1950's, now accounts for a small share of the total.
The selection criteria are important because immigration is expected to account for a growing proportion of the United States' population growth in the next two decades. The Census Bureau says that the proportion, now 27 percent, would rise to 35 percent by the year 2005 if current trends continue.
The House approved the immigration bill by a vote of 264 to 118. The margin in the Senate was 89 to 8.
The bill ranks in importance with the Quota Act of 1921, which established the first numerical restrictions on immigration, and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the McCarran-Walter Act, which listed dozens of ideological and other reasons for excluding aliens. The new measure was described by its sponsors as a logical companion to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which outlawed the hiring of illegal aliens, but made only a few small changes in legal immigration.  Salvadorans Protected
Representative E. (Kika) de la Garza, Democrat of Texas, said he voted against the 1986 measure, but for the bill on Saturday. ""It's as good a bill as we could have had,"" he said today in an interview.
Under the bill, Salvadorans already in the United States could stay in a ""special temporary protected status"" through June 30, 1992, after which the Attorney General could extend their stay. They would have to register with the Federal Government. Salvadorans and their advocates have long argued that it was unsafe for Salvadorans to return home because of the civil war in their country.
The bill also gives the Attorney General explicit new authority to offer a ""temporary protected status"" to certain aliens from countries where there has been an earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic or ""other environmental disaster.""",0
"(Before It's News)In the early universe, brilliant starburst galaxies converted vast stores of hydrogen gas into new stars at a furious pace.
The energy from this vigorous star formation took its toll on many young galaxies, blasting away much of their hydrogen gas, tamping down future star formation. For reasons that remained unclear, other young galaxies were somehow able to retain their youthful star-forming power long after similar galaxies settled into middle age.
This cartoon shows how gas falling into distant starburst galaxies ends up in vast turbulent reservoirs of cool gas extending 30 000 light-years from the central regions. ALMA has been used to detect these turbulent reservoirs of cold gas surrounding similar distant starburst galaxies. By detecting CH+ for the first time in the distant Universe, this research opens up a new window of exploration into a critical epoch of star formation.

Shedding light on this mystery, astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) studied six distant starburst galaxies and discovered that five of them are surrounded by turbulent reservoirs of hydrogen gas, the fuel for future star formation.
These star forming “fuel tanks” were uncovered by the discovery of extensive regions of carbon hydride (CH+) molecules in and around the galaxies. CH+ is an ion of the CH molecule and it traces highly turbulent regions in galaxies that are teeming with hydrogen gas.
The new ALMA observations, led by Edith Falgarone (Ecole Normale Supérieure and Observatoire, Paris, France) and appearing in the journal Nature, help explain how galaxies manage to extend their period of rapid star formation.
“By detecting these molecules with ALMA, we discovered that there are huge reservoirs of turbulent gas surrounding distant starburst galaxies. These observations provide new insights into the growth of galaxies and how a galaxy’s environs fuel star formation,” said Edwin Bergin, an astronomer with the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and co-author on the paper.
“CH+ is a special molecule,” said Martin Zwaan, an astronomer at ESO, who contributed to the paper. “It needs a lot of energy to form and is very reactive, which means its lifetime is very short and it can’t be transported far. CH+ therefore traces how energy flows in the galaxies and their surroundings.”
This ALMA image shows the Cosmic Eyelash, a remote starburst galaxy that appears double and brightened by gravitational lensing. ALMA has been used to detect turbulent reservoirs of cold gas surrounding this and other distant starburst galaxies. By detecting CH+ for the first time in the distant Universe, this research opens up a new window of exploration into a critical epoch of star formation.

The observed CH+ reveals dense shock waves, powered by hot, fast galactic winds originating inside the galaxies’ star-forming regions. These winds flow through a galaxy and push material out of it. Their turbulent motions are such that the galaxy’s gravitational pull can recapture part of that material. This material then gathers into turbulent reservoirs of cool, low-density gas, extending more than 30,000 light-years from the galaxy’s star-forming region.
“With CH+, we learn that energy is stored within vast galaxy-sized winds and ends up as turbulent motions in previously unseen reservoirs of cold gas surrounding the galaxy,” said Falgarone. “Our results challenge the theory of galaxy evolution. By driving turbulence in the reservoirs, these galactic winds extend the starburst phase instead of quenching it.”
The team determined that galactic winds alone could not replenish the newly revealed gaseous reservoirs. The researchers suggest that the mass is provided by galactic mergers or accretion from hidden streams of gas, as predicted by current theory.
“This discovery represents a major step forward in our understanding of how the inflow of material is regulated around the most intense starburst galaxies in the early universe,” says ESO’s Director for Science, Rob Ivison, a co-author on the paper. “It shows what can be achieved when scientists from a variety of disciplines come together to exploit the capabilities of one of the world’s most powerful telescopes.”

"We all know that George Soros has been organizing anti-Trump riots across America through a liberal activist group he funds via the Open Society Foundations.
He also tried to help Hillary Clinton win last year election but the American people were able to see that and dodge the bullet!
But he wasn’t helping only the Democrats he find a way to fund the backstabbing Republicans in order to stop Trump from winning the election!
We can now see that even when President Trump won the Republican backed Congress is not allowing him to make any major change into our corrupt country!
According to WND:
The Republicans Soros supported less is Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and his predecessor, John Boehner, they have received less attention.
Republican presidential candidate John Kasich was also a big recipient of Soros largesse – to the tune at least $202,700. That makes Soros one of the Kasich presidential campaign’s top funders.
While the Soros Fund Management, just one of the Hungarian billionaire’s political tentacles, spent $224,300 on Democratic Party congressional campaigns in 2016, it also spent $31,400 on Republicans, including $10,800 on Ryan – the most of any member of the GOP, the same as it invested in Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, a Democrat.
Other GOP congressional recipients of Soros contributions include Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., ($2,500); Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. ($2,700); Rep. Joe Heck, R-Nev. ($2,700); Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio ($2,600); Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif. ($2,500); Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla. ($1,000); Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa ($1,000); Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. ($1,000); Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash. ($1,000); and Rep. Dan Donovan, R-N. Y. ($300).
It was defeated from the inside by the treachery of the Senate and the blood of the slain Julius Caesar. Just as Caesar was stabbed in the back by men he thought were his allies, Trump is facing the same treachery from his own party.
In the coming days and months, without our help and diligence, President Trump may also be gasping…..”Et Tu, Paul?”

"Roughly 86,000 Hondurans will receive a six-month extension of a humanitarian status that allows them to work in the United States, the Homeland Security Department announced Monday night.
But temporary protected status will be discontinued for an estimated 5,300 Nicaraguans after a one-year wind-down period that ends in January 2019.
TPS allows immigrants to remain in the United States if their home country experiences a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event while they're here. The temporary designation lasts six to 18 months, but Central American countries enjoyed repeated TPS renewals over the past two decades.
The Trump administration, though, has signaled that it opposes rubber-stamping TPS renewals, and that it will give such requests greater scrutiny.
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke faced a deadline Monday to decide whether to renew TPS designations for Honduras and Nicaragua. Both nations first received the designation in 1999, months after Hurricane Mitch carved a trail of destruction across Central America that left thousands dead.
Duke declined to make a decision regarding Honduras, a senior administration official said on a background call with reporters. As a result, the status will automatically renew for six months, a period that will last until July 5.
The acting secretary concluded she needed more time to make “an appropriately deliberative” decision regarding conditions in Honduras, according to the administration official. The official said further research may lead DHS to terminate the protected status for Honduras after the six-month period ends.
In the case of Nicaragua, the department concluded that conditions in the country are better than before Mitch. The Nicaraguan government did not request a formal extension of the status, according to DHS.
“The acting secretary and the administration are committed to working with Congress to address the impact of Nicaragua’s TPS termination,” the official said. “Only Congress can legislate a permanent solution and provide those in an otherwise perpetually temporary status with a certain future.”
Overall, more than 400,000 immigrants were approved for the status at the end of 2016, according to DHS statistics. Of the 10 countries currently covered by TPS, the Trump administration has thus far announced termination for two — Nicaragua and Sudan.
Then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly granted a six-month extension to nearly 59,000 Haitians in May, but he cautioned that enrollees should use that time to make travel arrangements.
The administration will face another decision by Nov. 23 on Haiti, whose government has petitioned aggressively for an extension. In January, TPS is set to expire for roughly 263,000 people from El Salvador — by far the largest group to benefit from the program.
Unite Here, a labor union that represents workers in the immigrant-heavy hotel and food service sectors, blasted the decision to phase out TPS for Nicaraguans, calling the move “a stain on American history” that will tear families apart.
“Donald Trump has taken hundreds of thousands of dedicated employees who serve our country and turned them into targets for deportation overnight,” said Maria Elena Durazo, the union’s general vice president for immigration, civil rights and diversity.
The number of people currently enrolled in TPS may be be smaller than what statistics provided by DHS say. In a report last week, the Congressional Research Service estimated that in 2017 only 57,000 would re-register for the status from Honduras and 2,550 from Nicaragua. Overall, the report found, about 318,000 would renew.",0

"CHASHAN, China — Desde su hogar en las montaas del noreste de China, Li Zhi ha observado a la distancia cómo la prosperidad ha transformado a China en una tierra de trenes de alta velocidad, multimillonarios y rascacielos.
Sin embargo, el auge económico que ha enriquecido a China nunca llegó a Chashan, una población desolada de cuarenta personas que se encuentra a unas seis horas en coche de Pekín. Li, de 72 aos, se pasa los días cojeando por los caminos polvosos para recolectar basura a cambio de propinas. Rígido y demacrado, subsiste con una dieta a base de arroz, pan al vapor y licor destilado.
“No le intereso al país”, afirmó Li mientras se hacía un cigarro en su casa. “A nadie le importo”.
A casi siete décadas de la llegada al poder del Partido Comunista de China, con la promesa de prosperidad para todos, el presidente Xi Jinping ha asegurado que cumplirá con esa iniciativa original, al vincular su legado con un plan ambicioso que busca erradicar la pobreza rural para 2020.
El foco del plan son las más de 43 millones de personas que se las arreglan para vivir con el equivalente a menos de 95 centavos de dólar al día, que el gobierno chino estableció como el umbral de pobreza. Hace cinco aos, casi 100 millones de personas vivían debajo de esa línea, según las estadísticas oficiales.
Xi, quien recientemente cimentó su estatus junto a Mao Zedong como uno de los líderes modernos más poderosos de China, considera que mejorar los estándares de vida es esencial para apaciguar las frustraciones que nacen de la desigualdad y para asegurarle a su partido el control del poder durante la que el presidente ha llamado una nueva era de fortaleza nacional.
Sin embargo, la visión idealista de Xi choca con una dura realidad en una buena parte de la China rural. En muchos poblados, los jóvenes se han ido y han dejado que los residentes más viejos se las arreglen solos. La disparidad en la educación, la atención médica y los servicios sociales sigue siendo severa.
Aun cuando en las ciudades chinas abundan los nuevos ricos y la clase media, cerca de 500 millones de personas –alrededor de 40 por ciento de la población de China– viven con menos de 5,50 dólares al día, según el Banco Mundial.
“La idea del socialismo era que todos los chinos tendrían un estándar de vida razonable”, sealó Kerry Brown, un académico del King’s College de Londres especializado en China. “Lo más inquietante es que el Partido Comunista ha creado multimillonarios y una sólida clase media, pero aún hay mucha gente pobre. Esto parece una enorme contradicción”.
Al tiempo que China trabaja para modernizar su economía, tiene una realidad enfrentada: es la nueva superpotencia del mundo y, a la par, una nación en vías de desarrollo con un inmenso problema de pobreza. Los expertos aseguran que la desaceleración de la economía y la pérdida de trabajos de manufactura podrían empeorar el deterioro de las familias con bajos ingresos; esto socavaría la visión de Xi.
Durante el gobierno de Xi —quien ha querido proyectar una imagen de de hombre común—, la lucha contra la pobreza se ha convertido en un mantra nacional. Los medios administrados por el Estado usualmente muestran a Xi en sus visitas a poblados pobres, cuando prueba la comida y verifica la salud de los residentes. Los noticiarios nocturnos están llenos de historias sobre las comunidades renovadas y los habitantes de estos sitios que se han convertido en empresarios y que llenan de halagos a Xi y al gobierno por haberles otorgado préstamos y nuevos apartamentos.
El 25 de octubre, durante un discurso que marcó el inicio de su segundo periodo quinquenal como líder del partido, Xi mencionó que una de sus principales prioridades era la erradicación de la pobreza para 2020 y prometió “no dejar a nadie atrás en la marcha hacia la prosperidad común”.
Xi también ha utilizado la lucha contra la pobreza para fortalecer las alianzas de China a nivel mundial, por medio del financiamiento de programas en frica, América Latina y el sureste asiático, y al urgir al mundo a que aprenda de la experiencia de China.
Ahora Xi enfrenta la presión de mostrar los resultados.
Algunas personas creen que el objetivo que se planteó el gobierno al enfocarse en 43 millones de personas es demasiado limitado, pues hay millones más que viven apenas sobre la línea oficial de pobreza y en condiciones que no son mucho mejores. Por otro lado, hay quienes opinan que, al enfocarse en zonas rurales, Xi está descuidando la mala situación de los pobres urbanos, muchos de los cuales son migrantes del campo.
“Las iniciativas del gobierno suenan bien”, sealó Qin Gao, un profesor de la Universidad de Columbia que estudia la política social china. “Pero la pregunta es cómo mantener la reducción de la pobreza. Algunas personas podrían estar buscando soluciones rápidas en vez de abordar las raíces del problema”.
Xi ha ordenado a los funcionarios que se concentren en paliar la pobreza en lugares rurales como Chashan, donde las condiciones de labranza son malas, el acceso a los servicios sociales básicos es limitado y los residentes sufren de problemas cardiacos y otros males sin que haya una clínica cercana.
El gobierno ha empleado una variedad de apoyos para intentar sacar a la gente de la pobreza, con una inversión de miles de millones de dólares, y ha otorgado más de 370.000 millones de dólares en préstamos. Los funcionarios locales, quienes son juzgados por el partido en parte por el éxito que puedan tener en mejorar los estándares de vida, están trabajando a marchas forzadas para cumplir con la fecha límite que planteó Xi.
Algunas poblaciones han experimentado con cooperativas rurales, lo cual ha permitido que las familias aumenten la producción al compartir la mano de obra y los recursos. Los bancos administrados por el Estado han otorgado micropréstamos para que los pobladores puedan acceder al auge del comercio electrónico en China, vendiendo vestidos bordados y otros productos en línea.
No obstante, todavía viene lo más difícil. Casi la mitad de las 43 millones de personas que han sido clasificadas de manera oficial como pobres podrían tener alguna discapacidad, según el gobierno. La campaa también debe llegar a zonas que han sido pobres de forma crónica durante generaciones, entre ellas muchas que albergan minorías étnicas.
Los funcionarios de estas zonas están mudando a los pobladores cerca de las ciudades a apartamentos otorgados por el gobierno, donde a veces son reubicados en contra de su voluntad. Están entregando subsidios en efectivo a los residentes discapacitados. Además, están siguiendo las órdenes de Xi sobre una estrategia “focalizada”, al monitorear el progreso de residentes individuales en tableros gigantes de anuncios puestos en centros municipales.
La corrupción también es un problema: en 2016, más de 1800 personas fueron investigadas por defraudar fondos antipobreza y por crímenes relacionados, de acuerdo con las estadísticas oficiales. Los académicos también han externado sus dudas respecto de la confiabilidad de algunos datos, pues argumentan que hay funcionarios locales que parecen no reportar los verdaderos índices de pobreza a causa de la intensa presión que implica cumplir los objetivos de Xi.
Por otro lado, tienen el problema de que la campaa de Xi no está enfocada en las zonas urbanas. Hay más de 200 millones de migrantes rurales en las ciudades chinas, donde muchos sufren para recibir educación, atención médica y otros beneficios porque los gobiernos locales no los consideran residentes. Algunos están desempleados o tienen mala salud y viven en condiciones miserables.
“Este es un gran problema en el panorama general, que el gobierno no suele enfrentar”, sealó Philip G. Alston, académico y asesor para las Naciones Unidas y quien publicó un informe este ao sobre pobreza extrema y derechos humanos en China. “La realidad es que muchos de ellos están viviendo en pobreza extrema”.",0
"SAN DIEGO, CA; May 18, 2017 – East Tennessee PBS, WHYY, Community IdeaStations and Georgia Public Broadcasting were named today by PBS as the category winners for the 2017 PBS Development Awards, which recognizes member stations for outstanding corporate support, membership, philanthropy and special achievement fundraising efforts in local communities. The PBS Development Awards were presented at the first-annual DevDay, which followed the PBS Annual Meeting.
“Since our founding, development has served as the backbone of public media, ensuring that we have the resources and capacity needed to deliver on our mission today and in the future,” said Paula Kerger, PBS President and CEO. “We are thrilled to recognize East Tennessee PBS, WHYY, Community Idea Stations and Georgia Public Broadcasting for their innovative leadership in fostering deep local support to sustain public television’s public service mission.”
East Tennessee PBS, which serves Knoxville and tri-cities regions of East Tennessee, was honored with the Corporate Support Award. The Membership Award was presented to WHYY, which serves Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the Delaware Valley. Community Idea Stations, serving central Virginia, was named the Philanthropy Award winner. Georgia Public Broadcasting won the Special Achievement Award. The winner of the 2017 C. Scott Elliott Development Professional of the Year Award, announced earlier at the Annual Meeting, is Earl Blauner, Special Counsel, Gift Planning and Endowment, at KQED.
“In many ways, public media is about meeting viewers where they are – whether that’s over the air, via the internet or increasingly over mobile devices,” said Betsy Gerdeman, PBS Senior Vice President for Development Services. “The most effective fundraiser does the same thing for donors, reaching both longstanding and future donors with care and consideration for their time and what matters to them most: the impact of their giving on the community. This year’s recipients – East Tennessee PBS, WHYY, Community Idea Stations and Georgia Public Broadcasting – each embodied that aim with community-driven strategies.”
TheCorporate Support Awardrecognizes leaders in public media for their success in securing new sources of corporate revenue, incorporating new techniques, or developing innovative strategies and targeted marketing efforts. East Tennessee PBS was recognized for its successful launch of PBS KIDS 24/7 Service. The station researched children’s viewing habits, identifying an undeniable opportunity to serve children in need of quality educational programming. East Tennessee PBS created unique packages and strategies to welcome seven new sponsors and generate $28,000 annually over a five-year period to fund this invaluable service.
TheMembership Awardrecognizes successful membership strategies that have led to increases of net revenue, donor files or prospect pipeline, or the incorporation of new engagement activities resulting in increased giving. WHYY was cited for its commitment to black history content as a catalyst for new member acquisition. Through extensive strategic engagement, WHYY leveraged specific content – MANY RIVERS TO CROSS, BLACK AMERICA SINCE MLK and THE BLACK PANTHERS – to reconnect with and retain existing members and acquire memberships from a more diverse demographic within their community. In only 18 months, WHYY acquired more than 3,500 new donors, prospects and members through a combination of pledge events and community engagement, including screening and panel discussions and historical tours.
ThePhilanthropy Awardrecognizes successful fundraising efforts that directly strengthen a station’s financial sustainability. Community Idea Stations received recognition for its major giving program, the Commonwealth Circle. Through strategic cultivation and concurrent engagement strategies that encourage face-to-face interaction with donors and interactive stewardship, the Commonwealth Circle has seen a 139% increase in number of donors giving $1,000 or more and a 99% increase in revenue over a five-year period. Year over year, 92% of donors are retained. In 2016 alone, Commonwealth Circle revenue has helped fund community outreach, TV productions about local issues and three documentary productions, including one that aired nationally.
TheSpecial Achievement Awardrecognizes successful projects that have a broader organizational or community reach, or outside a single discipline. Georgia Public Broadcasting won this category for its fundraising approach across all platforms. The station refined its internal operations and changed its staff structure to give more team members a stake in development goals. Performance ratings were based on overall organizational fundraising success rather than individual goals. This led to GPB’s overall development revenue growth from $4.8 million in FY13 to $7.4 million in FY16 (with $1 million year-over-year increases). The station’s sustainer program grew from $264,000 to more than $1.1 million, with the aim of inducing half of all donors to become sustainers by 2018.

"PENTAGON -- When it comes to North Korea, the U. S. military has been ""locked and loaded"" for years. The motto of the 28,000 American troops in South Korea -- as well as long range bombers based 2,000 miles away on Guam -- is ""Fight Tonight,"" meaning be ready for an attack that could come with little or no warning.
They will become even more ready later this month when 3,000 more troops arrive in South Korea for one of several exercises held each year.
Ballistic missile defenses in South Korea, Guam and the U. S. are kept on alert in case North Korea launches a missile in their direction.
On Guam, local officials took the added precaution of putting out a bulletin explaining what to do in the event of nuclear attack: ""Do not look at the flash or fireball -- it can blind you.""
Officials say if the North fired a missile at the American homeland or a U. S. military base overseas, the Pentagon would first try to shoot it down. Then second, the U.S. would retaliate with an attack of its own, perhaps with a cyber weapon. In the unlikely event the North used a nuclear weapon, the U.S. would mount a much more devastating attack
The Pentagon also has options for a preemptive strike to knock out North Korea's nuclear weapons facilities. But retired Adm. James Winnefeld, formerly the No. 2 man in uniform, says that would be a long shot.
""It's a very difficult target,"" Winnefeld told CBS News. ""It's a very mountainous country. They have buried much of what they do. It's very hard to locate. So it's a very risky operation to try to take all of those diverse and dispersed targets out at one time.""
President Trump tweeted ""military solutions are now fully in place."" But Pentagon officials insist no action is imminent and that the only real solution is a diplomatic one.",0
"The chiffon dress with the pasta print should have been the tipoff.

This fall, the duo partnered with the venerable Italian pasta makerPastificio di Martino to produce an extremely limited edition tin of pastas along with a D&G-designed apron. Only 5,000 of the tins will be available worldwide; fewer than 1,000 of those will be available in the U. S.
Di Martino has been in the pasta business since 1912; its productwas the first pasta to cross the Panama Canal. It’s pastas are nowavailable worldwide and account forannual revenue of more than $163 million.In the U. S. they’re available at Whole Foods.
The family-owned company is based in Gragnano, in Naples, a town known for the pedigree of its dried pasta. Di Martino produces more than 9,000 tons of pasta a day in 125 different shapes, made from 100 percent Italian durum wheat (low-priced Canadian wheat has been flooding Italy’s market). Its great chewy, nonsticky texture has been lauded by such organizations as Slow Food.
Dolce & Gabbanaisn’tmessing around with di Martino’s pasta recipe. It has designed the packaging for a handful of pasta shapes, along with that custom-designed apron. The engaging, limited-edition pasta wrappings are made for three shapes (spaghetti, the tubular paccheri, and penne mezzani rigate). The design features old-school southern Italian figures, such as a Sophia Loren-esque brunette holding a plate of tomato-sauced pasta, interspersed with brightly colored tiles, and the tagline, ""La Famiglia, La Pasta, e L'Italia!""(Translation: ""Family, Pasta and Italy!”) Although the packaging evokes southern Italy, there are illustrations of landmarks from all over the country—including the Duomo of Milan, a Venetian canal, the Colosseum, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
The tins will be available in Pasta Di Martino's stores in Naples and Bologna. In the U. S., the tinswill be sold online starting November 15th at dimartinodolcegabbana.com and available in select stores including Buon’Italia in Chelsea Market in New York. (Later in 2018, downtown New York will get its own di Martino store; the company is planning a major American expansion.) In London, the tins will adorn holiday windows at Harrods; Dolce & Gabbana is outfitting many of the displays. The tins retail for about $110. For a preview of the apron, check out Stefano Gabbana’s Instagram feed.
This is just the first collaboration between the two independent Italian companies, according to Guiseppe di Martino, chief executive officer of the Pastifico di Martino and a fourth-generation pasta maker. He says that after the designers began incorporating food into their runway designs, they began looking for a partner for future culinary focused projects, and found di Martino.“We have a two-year contract with them, but we have talked about 25,000 things, so this is just the beginning,” he says. “This is the first time ever in history that food and fashion have come together like this.” According to di Martino, his pasta will play a big part in D&G’s holiday display at Harrods.
Meanwhile, pasta has announced itself in Dolce & Gabbana campaigns for straight fashion and beauty. In its recent ad forThe One fragrance, Emilia Clarke dances around, then sits down to a bowl of spaghetti. You can’t see the package, but that’s di Martino pasta that the Game of Thrones star is eating. (The pasta figureseven more prominently in a video taken immediately after D&G’s Spring 2018 Milan fashion show.)",0

Seniors spend the day playing cards and socializing at the Lorton Senior Center in Lorton, Va. The center operates out of leased space in a strip mall because there is a shortage of funds for new senior centers in the county. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)  More and more these days, when Fairfax County paramedics respond to emergency calls, they find an older person who has fallen, broken a bone or suffered a heart attack. In Maryland’s most populous jurisdiction, Montgomery County, authorities are investigating an increasing number of elder-abuse cases and crimes targeting senior citizens. In Chicago, New York City and elsewhere, more money is being allotted to government buses that take seniors to exercise classes and social workers who help families at a loss for how to care for aging loved ones. Rising demand for services for the elderly is taking a toll on local governments, as communities nationwide seek to accommodate a growing senior citizen population while still tending to schools, roads, parks and other needs. By 2030, 1 out of 5 U. S. residents — a total of 70 million people — will be 65 or older, according to population estimates. At the same time, federal funding for senior citizen programs has decreased by about 19percent since 2010, to just less than $8billion, according to the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging. It is expected to shrink further under President Trump. Policy experts say battles over spending, services and zoning will only worsen as baby boomers enter into stages of greater dependency, creating a headache for local budget officials whose constituents already feel taxed to the limit. “If you have to build schools and you also have to add more transportation and senior centers for older adults, where does the money come from?” said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who writes about tax policy and elder care. “It’s a very hard question to answer.” Fairfax County, Virginia’s largest and most economically powerful jurisdiction, embodies the challenge many local governments face. The two fastest-growing age groups in the county of 1.1million are schoolchildren and people older than 65. The elderly population is expected to grow from 135,000 to 172,000 over the next eight years. A Washington Post review of 13 agency budget reports showed that services for seniors has helped drive up spending by about $43.8million since 2014 — nearly 10percent of the county’s overall spending growth during that period. Some of that money went to initiatives created through the Fairfax 50-plus Community Action Plan, which focuses on transportation improvements, affordable housing and social programs to help elderly residents age in place. At the same time, the County Board of Supervisors denied or trimmed funding requests for employee raises, police reforms and education, and voters resoundingly rejected a meals tax to generate new revenue for the fast-growing school system. “We need to make sure that folks can continue to live within the community where they raised their families,” said Sharon Bulova (D), the board’s chairman. “But we’re also doing so at a time when we’ve had the Great Recession and have had to make reductions across the board in all the services we provide.”
Loyalty Litonjua, center, 76, during a group Zumba class at the Lorton Senior Center in Lorton, Va. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)   The Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department is on pace to exceed 100,000 emergency calls this year — 10,000 more than in 2014. People age 65 or older represent 40percent of the volume. The agency’s budget has grown nearly 19percent in the past four years. In 2016, the department began staffing a paramedic on every fire engine and ambulance, to better deal with severe emergencies such as cardiac arrest or car crashes. It also launched a program to encourage elderly residents to keep their medical histories readily accessible inside vehicle glove compartments or posted on their fridge. Dorothy Carter, 83, had not done so when county firefighters and paramedics showed up outside her Annandale apartment one morning this past summer. The former nurse’s aide had been gardening when she tripped and fell. By the time her roommate found her, she’d been laying in the hot sun for more than five hours, with bits of mulch clinging to her hair. “I’m sorry,” Carter muttered while emergency workers helped her sit up. “No, ma’am,” paramedic Steve Urban replied. “Don’t be sorry. I’m here for you.” Carter was loaded into an ambulance and taken to a hospital, where she was treated for high blood pressure. Elderly slip-and-fall cases are a huge concern as senior citizens become less mobile, officials say. That has contributed to a rising demand for assisted-living centers and nursing homes. In Fairfax and elsewhere, proposals for new or expanded facilities have sparked major zoning battles and concerns over the cost of and effect on roads, sewers and other services. “The vast majority of people want to stay in their communities as they age, but many of those communities weren’t designed for that,” said Rodney Harrell, a public policy director at AARP. “We’ve spent decades, and maybe even centuries, not planning for aging and designing for aging.” Paramedics have seen some extreme cases, such as the 66-year-old man they found dead near his bed in Springfield earlier this year, apparently of cardiac arrest. His bedroom was filled with paperwork and junk-food cartons. On the bureau were three large plastic cups of urine — a sign that the home’s occupant had not left the room in days. John J. Kenney, chief of Montgomery County’s Aging and Disability Services program, said officials there are worried about a rise in financial crimes against seniors and a lack of affordable housing for them in an era of shrinking resources. “There is always this competition in trying to establish what our priorities are,” Kenney said.  Fairfax’s Division of Adult and Aging Services, which connects elderly residents to county programs and operates a hotline for seniors and their caregivers, has increased its budget by $986,000 since 2014. Last year, the hotline took in nearly 17,000 calls, up from 15,400 in 2013. They varied from pleas for Medicaid assistance to arranging rides to doctor’s appointments and setting up in-home care. Calls to the hotline led social workers to open 2,714 cases for adult protective services, which applies to people who are no longer able to function independently. “He was drinking and cut his foot?” social worker Bonita Stokes calmly asked one harried apartment manager whose tenant, age 69, had stepped on a broken wine bottle. Karen Hannigan, the division supervisor, said the county walks a fine line in deciding whether to merely counsel a caller on how an elderly person might live more safely at home, or recommend that they move somewhere they can get health- and life-care services. “When they get the gray hair or are on walkers or in wheelchairs, people immediately want to put that label on them of lacking capacity,” she said. “When you can see they’re completely out of it, that’s easy. Or when they’re completely sharp as a tack, that’s easy. Most of our clients are in between, so we have to figure it out.”
Judith Branagan, at home in Burke, Va., with her husband, Tom, 73, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2007. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)  The county is also dealing more with the deteriorating effects of Alzheimer’s disease. Social workers help patients find support groups, long-term care and transportation. Police and fire agencies respond to domestic violence and missing-persons investigations that can be linked to the disease. Judith Branagan turned to aging services for help with her husband, Tom, 73, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2007. Three years ago, she enrolled him in a day program near their home in Burke that relies on volunteers trained to help Alzheimer’s patients with physical and mental exercises. As the elderly population continues to grow, more programs — and volunteers — will be needed, she said. “That’s going to have to be the Plan B,” she said. “The government funding isn’t always going to be there.” Last year, Fairfax voters approved $37million in bonds to replace an aging senior center in Chantilly and build a new one in Lorton, where senior programs currently take place in leased space inside a neighborhood strip mall.
Blanca Araujo, 70, talks with Julia Gonzales, 76, at the Lorton Senior Center in Lorton, Va. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)  Officials decided to wait at least until 2024 to ask voters to approve a $16million bond for another senior center in Springfield, however. In the meantime, the county wants to secure funds to upgrade its sewer system, fix deteriorating parks and tend to other infrastructure needs.  The shortage of space for recreation programs led to the creation in 2009 of the county’s Senior Center Without Walls program, where libraries and local houses of worship host discussion groups and classes. On a recent day, the line-dancing class in a Pohick Regional Library community room in Burke was so crowded the dancers had little room to maneuver. “When we started this program, we only had 75 people. Now, we have 1,000 members and a growing waiting list,” said co-founder Corazon Foley. “Some of the facilities that helped us are dropping out. They figured they would be helping us for only one or two years. It is a scramble.” Frank Shafroth, director of George Mason University’s Center for State and Local Government Leadership, said the needs of the nation’s aging population is something most local governments “haven’t adequately prepared for.” “This generation is living longer lives than previous generations,” Shafroth said. “You’re going to get this huge tension over taxes and what people are willing to pay for older people who can no longer take care of themselves.”    Fairfax County says no to meals tax   More seniors are taking loans against their homes — and it’s costing them   Singletary: Trump’s budget tells struggling seniors: You’ll be on your own   These teens are bridging the digital divide for seniors",0

War Of The Sacred Code: The True Secret Of 2012
By Sorcha Faal
Special Offer: $38.95 plus $4.50 Shipping and Handling [US Funds]
Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? Genesis 3:1
And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. Genesis 3:22-23
The great dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him. Revelation 12:9
From wars and rumors of war, global economic collapse, new earthquakes and volcanic eruptions growing in violence and destruction, and massive weather changes occurring on a near daily basis, the world of 2012 faces, perhaps, as it never has in modern times an apocalypse of catastrophic proportions.
Into this maelstrom of chaos there has been interjected so many competing theories, explanations, predictions, etc., one can not be blamed for throwing their hands up in utter confusion as to what it all means, and what the final outcome will be.
In her new book, War Of The Sacred Code: The True Secret Of 2012, the Sorcha Faal lays out the historical timeline for the true importance of this year 2012 as handed down to us from the most ancient of cultures, from all around the world, who not only survived our Earths last overturning, but explained it in exquisite detail for all who truly wish to know the facts, regardless of the path which they will bring you down.
At the heart (genesis) of the Sorcha Faals seminal work is the full explanation of why the two most revered symbols of the ancients, Wings and Serpents, were combined to form the Caduceus, recognized the world over as the modern symbol of medicine, but which, in fact, was born in the ancient mists of time nearly 10,000 years ago.
The Winged-Serpent is known throughout the world by many names including: Dragon, in many Eastern cultures, Quetzalcoatl in Mesoamerica, the Devil/Satan by over 2 billion Christians and Muslim peoples, and over 8,000 other various names from every indigenous culture on Earth.
Though the names for the Winged-Serpent are many, the single defining attribute of this deity was its ability to give to human beings the knowledge of gods so that they too could ascend into the heavens and live forever.
Battling against the Winged-Serpent, however, were the gods who warned that if human beings ever gained this knowledge they would, indeed, live forever and nothing would able to stop them from whatever they wished to do.
The gods did not say that human beings could never have the knowledge offered to them by the Winged-Serpent, far from it.  In fact, and as the ancient writings detail at great length, human beings first had to be purified (in Christian theology born again) before the final gift of eternal life was able to be bestowed upon them. And according to these same writings left to us from our most ancient forbearers, this purification process for humanity would take thousands of years.
Running concurrently with this purification process given to humanity by the gods, the Sorcha Faal explains in this book, the Winged-Serpent has not ceased in its efforts to give to mankind this knowledge of the gods and eternal lifeand which in 2012 is about to happen.
For you see, the Sorcha Faal explains, the knowledge of the gods and eternal life lies within what the ancients called The Sacred Code and as exactly depicted by the Winged-Serpent symbol is our very own DNA.
Like computer code, which can produce a myriad of different applications with the same coding language, our DNA is the structure of a program set in motion millions of years ago, with the ability to replicate, reproduce, and change.  Genetic engineering, the replacement or substitution of genes within a genome, is as old as we are, and viruses are the methodology.  Just because we have learned to do this ourselves recently, does not make the process new... we just figured out a little bit of our own creators' technology.
What hasnt changed about The Sacred Code, the Sorcha Faal says, are Histone 3 (H3) and Histone 4 (H4) which have had a zero rate of change over 100 million years and are part of the DNA of all organisms from microbes to humans, but which later this year many experts believe the secrets of which will be unlocked granting to humanity the power of the gods.
The danger to humanity of unleashing this power of the gods, the Sorcha Faal warns, lies in a particular set of genes within our DNA that resides in about half of the human population. In just one study alone conducted by the United States Department of Justice, the carriers of this gene set are responsible for the vast majority of crimes to include:
Average Number of Violent Crimes Committed Annually in the United States
Offense                                  Carrying this gene set       Not carrying this gene set
Aggravated Assault               3,419,000                          435,000
Homicide                                    14,196                               1,468
Armed robbery                      2,051,000                            157,000
Sexual Assault                          442,000                             10,000
Join the Sorcha Faal on the most incredible journey of your life in exploring the true facts of humanity which prove we are all part of a grand experiment that throughout our entire history has called for the culling of the human herd in order to remove from it the most dangerous gene set the universe has ever known.
From warfare to mass catastrophes to global pandemics, the Sorcha Faal explains how all of them, and more, are directly related to the refining of our human DNA to match that of the gods.
Listen carefully as the Sorcha Faal relates how this refining of the human herd by the gods is being opposed by the Winged-Serpent and its forces which seeks to combine the this most dangerous gene set with the DNA of the gods to create a new being the ancients warn would be the most powerful being in the universe.
Be amazed as the Sorcha Faal explains how our DNA, though only containing 750 megabytes, is able to be changed and manipulated by mass communication, social pressures, deviant morality, even the very food you eat!
Learn carefully the Sorcha Faals most important advice on how to avoid the war between the gods and the Winged-Serpent that is soon to erupt into the open as this grand human experiment nears its final conclusion.

"The Faroe Islands, a remote archipelago that juts out of the cold seas between Norway and Iceland, doesn’t even appear on some world maps. But as of last week, the verdant slopes, rocky hiking trails and few roads ofthe 18 islands are on Google Street View — and a team ofcamera-toting sheep helped get them there.
When theislands’ tourism board decided last year that it wanted to getthe company’s attention, it knew it would need an unusual pitch. It also knew that its rugged terrain would not be easilytraversed by those Google cars that ply city streets worldwide,snapping photos. So itstrapped solar-powered, 360-degree cameras onto the backs of a few shaggy Faroese sheep andbegan uploading the resulting, and very breathtaking, images toStreet Viewitself.
The whole sheepidea — which the tourism boardcalled “Sheepview 360”— was not such a stretch. Sheep are a big deal in the Faroe Islands, an autonomous nation within the Kingdom of Denmark whose name translates to “islands of the sheep.” Theislands’ distinct breed is believed to have been imported byNorse settlers in the 9th century, and today about 80,000 sheep live there, far outnumbering the 50,000 people. Tourism official Levi Hanssen said most Faroese have some connection toraising sheep, aboutone-third ofwhich are slaughtered for meat; the others are used for wool and dairy products.
And although all the sheep are owned, theyroam freely — usually.
“It’s not very easy putting cameras on sheep,” Hanssen, the content manager for VisitFaroeIslands.com, said in an interview. “We would just stand there, and they would stand there and look at us. You have to, in some way, get them to move.”
Movethey eventually did, and the tourism board was soon posting videos and maps of the sheep videographers’ movements on its website. It held a naming contest for one sheep on the crew. (The winning submission: “Baaa-bra.”) Locals and visitors were encouraged to share photos of the Faroe Islands on social media with the hashtags #WeWantGoogleStreetView and #VisitFaroeIslands.
It didn’t take long for themedia-friendly storyto makeits way to Google, which pronounced it “shear brilliance.” Last summer, the company visited the islands and loaned out one of its eyeball-like Street View Trekkers, as well as some 360-degree cameras for human use. In a blog post, the former tourism board employee who spearheaded the campaign, Durita Dahl Andreassen, explained that those would be handed out to locals and tourists alike and that they would be attached to “sheep, bikes, backpacks, ships and even a wheelbarrow.”
“We, obviously, couldn’t map the whole country with sheep,” Hanssen said.
Last week, the Faroe Islands madeits debut on Google Street View. Most images ended up being captured by humans, and they included all public roads and hiking trails. ButHanssen said the tourism board decided to leave some spots outto preserve a bit of the islands’ mystery.
Sheepview was charming, but it was at heart a marketing bid — and a successful one, said Hanssen, who said it had a “PR value we could never have bought ourselves.” Hotel reservation rates, the country’s primaryyardstick formeasuring tourism, are up at least 10 percent this year, he said. Visitors tend to be outdoorsy types, but the islands are also increasingly attractinggourmands who come for “really good, locally sourced food,” Hanssen said.
The tourism board has moved on toa new, sheep-free effort to getGoogle Translate toincludeFaroese, which descendsfrom old Norse.
As for the sheep that made Street View happen? They retired from filming, Hanssen said. He wasn’t sure, however, whether any ended up as someone’s locally sourced dinner.

"""Retirement is like a long vacation in Las Vegas. The goal is to enjoy it the fullest, but not so fully that you run out of money.""-- Jonathan Clements
The quip above is amusing, but it also points out a critical aspect of retirement: the need to have our retirement dollars last for the rest of our life. Succeeding at that goal isn't likely to happen by accident, so it's worth learning more about retirement and investing for retirement, in order to have the best shot at a comfortable future.
Here are 20 eye-opening facts related to retirement. See which ones surprise you the most.
63: If you imagine that most people work until about age 65 or longer, you'd be wrong: The average retirement age was recently 63.
72,000: Meanwhile, Americans are living longer than they used to. It's estimatedthat America is home to about 72,000 centenarians (people aged 100 or older).
38: Some retirees will need their nest eggs to last a whopping 38 years, which is longer than many people work over the course of their lifetimes. If you live to 100 and retire at age 62, for example, you're looking at 38 years of retirement.
28: If you only live to 90, that's still a significant 28 years that your dollars will need to last. Accordingto the Social Security Administration, ""About one out of every four 65-year-olds today will live past age 90, and one out of 10 will live past age95.""
70: Because of the possibility of living a long life, personal finance guru Suze Orman has advisedthat most people should aim to retire no earlier than age 70: ""Every dollar you don't spend in your 60s is a dollar that can keep growing for your 70s and beyond."" (For some people, this advice is sound. If you have planned well, though, and have socked away enough money for retirement, you could retire much earlier.)
46%: You might end up retiring earlier than you planned to. Accordingto the 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey, 46% of retirees left the workforce earlier than planned, with 55% citing health problems or a disability as the reason and 24% citing changes at work such as a downsizing or workplace closure.
$275,000: Healthcare can cost much more than you think it will. Accordingto Fidelity Investments, a 65-year-old couple retiring today will spend, on average, a total of $275,000 out of pocket on healthcare.
10%: If you're late enrolling for Medicare, it can cost you. Your part B premiums (which cover medical services, but not hospital services) can rise by 10% for each year that you were eligible for Medicare but didn't enroll. The no-penalty enrollment period for most people is any time within the three months leading up to your 65th birthday, during the month of your birthday, or within the three months that follow.
10%: A 2014 MassMutual surveyfound that 10% of retirees were surprised to find themselves lonely, bored, with a lost sense of purpose, and/or depressed in retirement.
72%: That same surveyfound that 72% of retired respondents reported feeling quite happy or extremely happy in retirement.
Less than $1,000: Accordingto the 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey, about 26% of respondents said they had less than $1,000 saved for retirement (not including pension or home values). A whopping 64% had saved less than $50,000. Here's the breakdown:
$100,000: Accordingto Fidelity Investments, which administers retirement accounts for many millions of Americans, the average 401(k) balance as of mid-2017 was $97,700, while the average IRA account balance climbed into six figures at $100,200.
21%: Fidelity also reported that fully a fifth of workers don't seem to be contributing enough to their 401(k) accounts to get all the matching funds offered by their employer. That's a shame, since matching funds are free money.
25% to 30%: Anemic retirement accounts are very worrisome, as those accounts are vital for many retirements. Indeed, income from 401(k) accounts has been estimatedto represent about 25% to 30% of overall retirement income.
4%: The ""4% rule"" can help you plan for retirement. It suggests that your money might last about 30 years if you withdraw just 4% in the first year and adjust for inflation in subsequent years. The rule has some significant flaws, but it's still helpful as a rough guide. The table below, showing the initial-year withdrawals that come with various nest eggs, per the 4% rule, can help you see how insufficient even $250,000 in retirement savings might be:
90%: Accordingto the Social Security Administration, most elderly beneficiaries get 50% or more of their income from Social Security, while 21% of married beneficiaries and 43% of unmarried ones get fully 90% or more of their income from it. And that's despite people not receiving huge sums from Social Security.
$1,371: The average monthly retirement benefit was recently$1,371, amounting to $16,452 per year.
$2,687: The overall maximummonthly Social Security benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age in 2017 is still just $2,687, or roughly $32,000 for the whole year.
$3,538: Those who retire at age 70 in 2017 can collect monthly checks as largeas $3,538, for $42,456 per year.
2%: Benefits are increased over time to keep up with inflation, with the most recent increase (2%) announcedin October to take effect in 2018.
Don't leave your retirement to chance — and don't let any of these statistics depress you. Plan and save effectively for retirement, and read up on helpful strategies, too. For example, there are lots of ways to boost your Social Security benefits. Simply delaying starting to collect them can beef them up by 24%.

Audi is offering a concierge rental service, Audi on Demand, in San Francisco. General Motors, meanwhile, launched its own pick-and-choose pilot in New York early this year, with Book by Cadillac letting buyers switch vehicles as often as 18 times a year for a flat $1,500 monthly fee.
Volvo just launched what it also calls a subscription service, Care by Volvo, that is, for now, limited to the new XC40 sport-utility vehicle. Customers pay a flat monthly fee, with no down payment, and will be able to upgrade to a new Volvo in as little as 12 months.
Also included is free pickup and delivery for service, with buyers getting loaners while their vehicles are in the shop. It's a feature a number of automakers have begun to offer, including Lincoln and Hyundai's recent luxury spinoff, Genesis. Makers hope that by enhancing the ownership experience they can entice new buyers to give them a try.
""We have to make sure we're retailing on the customer's terms,"" said Adam Chamberlain, vice president of sales for Mercedes-Benz USA, which is experimenting with online used car sales in Portland, Oregon. ""We have to make sure we give them the experience they want.""
The push for new retail models can be challenging, as automakers have to work around state franchise laws. Chamberlain said the company's dealers would be central to any new approach it tried.
Tesla has been steadfast in opening only factory-owned stores, a position that has forced it to battle in court with dealer groups in a number of states. In several others, including New Jersey, it has struck deals with lawmakers and regulators.
The push to find new ways of retailing is especially fierce among brands in the competitive luxury market. When customers are spending $60,000, $100,000, even $200,000 or more, they expect to have things done more on their terms, experts say.
But even mainstream brands are exploring new retail strategies that could radically change how customers buy, lease — or subscribe — in the future.
Hyundai's new Shopper Assurance program targets a number of issues consumers typically complain about. In addition to the three-day money-back guarantee, it will offer ""transparent"" pricing, flexible test drives and a simpler purchase process.
""We expect this to be a differentiator,"" said Dean Evans, chief marketing officer of Hyundai Motor America, adding: ""Our research showed that 84 percent of people would visit a dealership that offered all four features over one that did not. It is the future of car buying.""

Even for manufacturers still wedded to conventional retailing, things have changed dramatically, said Fran O'Hagan, head of the automotive retail consultancy Pied Piper.
""The combination of the internet and wide use of smartphones has had a huge impact on the retail auto industry,"" said O'Hagan, who is based in California.
""The role of the dealership and salespeople is still critical,"" but where they once were the gatekeepers, he said, buyers usually know what they want before they walk into the showroom, and ""the role of the salesperson is to now to help a customer fine-tune their choice of vehicle.""
Yet some speculate that millions of motorists may simply stop buying cars and switch to ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft as they make the transition to driverless vehicles and sharply lower the cost of their services.
That, said O'Hagan, will force manufacturers and their dealers to get even more creative to keep customers in the retail market.",0
"The real danger for Christie: His enemies (Democrats and Republicans) are ready to pounce… Lindsey Graham: “He’s kind of a bully”… Listing the red lines that Christie established in his story… Another danger for Christie: The scandal makes him look like any other politician… A disappointing jobs report: Just 74,000 jobs created in December, but unemployment rate drops to 6.7%... Paul Ryan talks poverty with NBC’s Brian Williams… And why the GOP getting Gillespie to run in Virginia is important.
The New Jersey Governor embarked on a road trip Thursday, apologizing to citizens and officials after emails revealed an orchestrated traffic delay by members of his staff last September. Christie maintains that he had no idea of his staff's actions. NBC's Kelly O'Donnell reports.
*** Christie’s enemies -- Democrats and Republicans -- are ready to pounce: By firing one of his top aides, apologizing to the residents of Fort Lee, and answering reporters’ questions for nearly two hours yesterday (sometimes impressively, sometimes unevenly), New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie lived to survive another day -- and more. (Who knows, Christie might have the Bill Clinton gene where a political performance can rescue him.) But as he deals with the fallout from this George Washington Bridge scandal, Christie faces a serious problem that goes well beyond whether anyone contradicts the story and timeline he laid out on Thursday: He has enemies, both Democratic and Republican ones, who are sharpening their knives. On the Democratic side, state lawmakers are holding hearings and investigations on the issue (example: Christie aide David Wildstein pleading the 5th yesterday), and that won’t stop anytime soon. Just as Darrell Issa and House Republicans hounded the Obama administration last year with subpoenas, leaks, and numerous hearings, New Jersey Democrats have the ability to make life miserable for Christie in 2014. But it’s not only Democrats. Some Republicans -- potential 2016 rivals, conservatives upset by his embrace of President Obama in 2012, or any other enemies he’s made along the way – have the ability to score points with this scandal. ""You're going to see conservatives returning the favor he gave them over the last year,” GOP strategist Rick Wilson told National Journal. “There's no love lost between Chris Christie and conservatives.”
*** Lindsey Graham: “He’s kind of a bully”: Speaking of Republicans saying critical things about Christie, don’t miss what Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told NBC’s Kasie Hunt. “It seems to me that this whole bridge thing reinforces a narrative that's troublesome about the guy, he's kind of a bully,"" Graham said. “If anybody in my office had done such a thing, they knew what their fate would be ‘cause I'm not that kind a guy. I just don't see how people that close to him could have felt comfortable enough to do this if they thought their boss wasn't of this mindset. Isn't that just common sense?"" Bottom line: Christie is on an island right now. If he were president or his party’s presidential nominee, you’d see the entire GOP coming to his defense. But that isn’t the case here, at least not right now.
*** I hate these red lines… I know you want it: As far as Christie’s performance yesterday, a lot seemed to depend on your knowledge of the story. The more you knew, probably the less impressed you were (the traffic study, his distancing himself from Wildstein). But the less you knew, probably the more impressed you were. Christie, after all, is a skilled political performer, and if he survives this story, he’s only going to be stronger. And a big part of success in American politics is an ability to survive (just ask Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama). But as NBC’s Mike O’Brien writes, Christie better hope there are NO HOLES in his story, because the political damage would be significant -- if not fatal.  There is no margin for error; every little thing will be examined. Indeed,NBC’s Carrie Dann notes that Christie established several red lines yesterday. Among them:
-  “I was done with my workout yesterday morning and got a call from my communications director at about8:50, 8:55, informing me of this story that had just broken on the Bergen Record website. That was the first time I knew about this.” (That means, according to Christie’s story, he had no information about any plans to cause traffic problems in Fort Lee beforeWednesday morning. Then again, you could argue it depends on the meaning of “this”; is “this” the emails themselves or the story was going public?)
-  “Mayor Sokolich was never on my radar screen. He was never mentioned to me as somebody whose endorsement we were even pursuing… I don't have any recollection of at any time, anybody in the campaign ever asking me to meet with Mayor Sokolich or call him.” (That means, per Christie’s telling, there were no obvious ties between Christie’s campaign and the Fort Lee mayor.)
-  “It is true that I met David [Wildstein] in 1977 in high school. He's a year older than me. David and I were not friends in high school. We were not even acquaintances in high school… I have had no contact with David Wildstein in a long time, a long time, well before the election. You know, I could probably count on one hand the number of conversations I've had with David since he worked at the Port Authority. I did not interact with David.” (That means, according to Christie, that we won’t find ANY recent contact between Wildstein and the governor.)
*** Another danger for Christie: The scandal makes him look like any other politician: Here’s a final point on Christie. Even if he survives this -- and he very well might -- the story has damaged him in this way: He looks like an ordinary politician. One of Christie’s key political strengths is that he’s perceived to be different than the rest. He’s a straight-shooter; he’s disgusted that Washington isn’t working for the American people; what you see is what you get. But even if his story holds up – that a handful of key aides, without his knowledge – caused traffic jams for political payback, that shine wears off.
*** A disappointing December jobs report: The news from the AP: “U. S. employers added a scant 74,000 jobs in December, the fewest in three years. The disappointing gain ends 2013 on a weak note after recent economic reports had raised hopes for a strong finish. The Labor Department says the unemployment rate fell from 7 percent in November to 6.7 percent, the lowest level since October 2008. But the drop occurred partly because more Americans stopped looking for jobs. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are actively searching for work. But these numbers sharply differ from this week’s ADP report, which said that 238,000 private-sector jobs were created last month. So which survey is right?
*** Paul Ryan on poverty: Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) told NBC’s Brian Williams in an interview as part of NBC’s In Plain Sight reporting project on poverty that LBJ’s “War on Poverty” has “failed.”It’s something the House Budget chairman said six months ago, too. And while Ryan has traveled the country after the election to impoverished areas trying to show Republicans are more compassionate to the plight of the poor, his effort -- so far -- seems more messaging than substantive policy shifts. The idea is: “Go there; go to places where people are hurting and try to sell them on conservative ideology, then they’ll realize how the left has distorted the right’s positions.” Ryan’s poverty message seemed to focus on what individuals could do in communities rather than what government can do to help. He’s promising to unveil more details soon on his poverty platform. But one thing to keep an eye on with Ryan, of all the potential 2016 candidates, no one (maybe with the exception of Marco Rubio) seems to be more interested in developing policy than Ryan. That is one way for him to stand out compared to the rest of the Washington-establishment wing of candidates.
*** Why the GOP getting Gillespie to run in Virginia is important: Lastly, Republicans have found a candidate to challenge Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) this year -- GOP strategist and lobbyist Ed Gillespie. Gillespie faces an uphill fight; after all, Warner is the most popular politician in Virginia. But don’t lose sight on the fact that Senate Republicans have now put NUMEROUS seats in play beyond the Alaska/Arkansas/Louisiana/Montana/North Carolina/South Dakota/West Virginia playing field. They have a strong candidate in Michigan; they might get Scott Brown to run in New Hampshire; and now they have Gillespie in Virginia, who at the least will make Warner and the Democrats have to spend money in Virginia this year. We’re not saying VA or NH or MI are suddenly toss-ups. But they aren’t run-aways anymore for the Dems. That’s more resources and more incumbents (toss in Colorado and Minnesota to boot) asking the DSCC for help. By comparison, the only two Republican seats Democrats have put in play are Georgia and Kentucky, and both are states Obama lost in 2008 and 2012. There are no Chris Coons’ or Joe Donnellys waiting in the wings to take advantage of Tea Party victories in Mississippi, South Carolina, Kansas, Tennessee or Texas. By the way, one more Virginia note: The 2012 winner in Virginia was a former DNC chair (Tim Kaine), and the 2013 winner was another former DNC chair (Terry McAuliffe). Can the former RNC Chair Gillespie have similar success in Virginia? Virginia is not just for lovers, but are they lovers of national party chairs, too?

"Meanwhile the federal prison population has grown from 20,000 prisoners in the 1980s to over 200,000 prisoners today. With states also passing mandatory sentencing laws, the prison population overall has skyrocketed. Today, the United States has more people behind bars than any other country in the world.
One out of every 100 adult Americans is in prison or jail. And the laws have had a disproportionately harsh effect on communities of color. For instance, on average, black male offenders are given sentences 20% higher than white males. Meanwhile federal prisons are overcrowded by 40%, and incarceration costs eat up 25% of the Justice Department's budget.
The federal government could be investing more in public infrastructure jobs and higher education, since employment and education have proved to decrease crime rates dramatically. Instead, politicians are slashing food stamps and public assistance funding while spending $29,000 per year per inmate in federal lockup.
And as the conservative writer Betsy Woodruff wrote in Slate, ""When Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz both think the same bill is a good idea, you might think it would have legs.""
Yet it would appear Grassley just doesn't wanna change the rules. Grassley is the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Simply put, given the generally powerful position of committee chairs on Capitol Hill, if Grassley doesn't want reform to happen, it won't. And he doesn't.
This past May, Grassley gave a floor speech voicing his strong opposition to the ""Smarter Sentencing Act."" Grassley connected America's drop in crime over the past decades partly to the use of mandatory minimum sentences.
Citing a year when the number of state and federal prisoners had dropped, Grassley argued there was a corresponding rise in crime despite other contradictory evidence. Plus, Grassley said, ""the only tool Congress has to make sure that federal judges do not abuse their discretion in sentencing too leniently is mandatory minimum sentences.""
In Grassley's world, the war on drugs is working and mandatory minimum laws are a tool for combating liberal activist judges. Given such illogical conclusions, one might jokingly ask whether Grassley is crusading against drugs or using too much of them himself.
But to anyone paying attention, what seems illogical is Grassley's ability to stand in the way of a strong bipartisan coalition of his colleagues and the overwhelming weight of factual evidence and public support. It's yet another reason Washington seems so dysfunctional.
It's one thing when one party in the majority passes, say, health care reform and then the other party stubbornly votes over and over again -- over 50 times -- to repeal the law. That's undeniably pointless and absurd but can at least be chalked up to petulant partisanship.
Yet here we have that rarest of species in Washington, agreement -- and in alignment with facts and popular opinion. The idea hat one person can stand in the way is insane. This isn't what our Founding Fathers had in mind. This isn't a checks-and-balances democracy. It's more like a monarchy, where Chuck Grassley is king.
Over 2 million Americans may continue to waste away in our bloated and broken prison system, and more will probably join them, merely because the way Congress does business gives so much power to committee chairs such as Grassley.
Until there's a way around that, Washington will seem broken, too.

"Admitting Toyota feels ""ashamed,"" the company's CEO and president Tuesday asked his customers to wait ""just a little longer"" for the company to fix a variety of defects now identified in almost nine million cars.
In announcing the latest recall of 437,000 Prius and Lexus 2010 hybrid models with a software glitch that affects the brakes, Akio Toyoda acknowledged that ""people think we were slow to respond.""
U. S. and Congressional investigators want to know why the Japanese car company waited at least a month to inform its customers and government agencies of the braking problem, well after it had introduced a fix to the software in cars being manufactured.
The Toyota CEO told reporters he ""did not recall the exact month and day"" when the company first learned of the brake problem with the Prius. ""I consistently receive all sorts of information,"" he said. ""If you ask when, the answer is this year.""
Some Toyota owners in the United States have been in rebellion over the company's slow response to their complaints of unwanted and uncontrolled acceleration that resulted in runaway cars.
Since 2003, the company has received reports of more than 2,000 accidents and 19 deaths tied to the acceleration problem.
The Toyota CEO said he was now personally taking charge of the situation and promised to visit the United States soon ""to explain the conditions and the situation to those people.""
""Let me assure everyone,"" Toyoda said from the company's global headquarters, ""that we will re-double our commitment to quality as a lifeline of our company with myself taking the lead.""
In Japan, four hybrid models will be recalled – the 2010 Prius, the Prius Plug-in Hybrid, the Sai model sold in Japan and the Lexus HS250h. The latter three models were introduced in the country last year.
Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) will notify hybrid owners of the recall in Japan beginning today. Corrective programming to fix the ABS software program is expected to start Feb 10 in Japan. The fix process is estimated to take about 40 minutes per vehicle.
Details about notifying U. S. owners were not yet available.
Toyota Executive Vice President Shinichi Sasaki presented a detailed technical explanation of the brake problem during the press conference that lasted about two hours.
The executives advised customers with cars not already fixed to brake firmly as they said the problems have been from customers braking too softly.
""If you are riding on a vehicle before the counter measure,"" Toyoda said as translated, ""and experience this release feeling, in that case, please apply further force on the brakes and it's safe.""",0
"Amid the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and the impending destruction of Hurricane Irma, many Americans may not be aware that the western region of the country is suffering the opposite wrath of mother nature. From southern California to Washington, wildfires are engulfing thousands of acres of land and prompting thousands of evacuations. Many of the states battling the wildfires have been doing so allsummer.
On Saturday, Washington Governor Jay Insleedeclareda state of emergency across the state due to the risk of wildfires, and the National Weather Service warned that 26 of the state’s 39 counties were at very high or extreme risk.Accordingto the Washington Department of Ecology, “[a]lmostall of WA [was] awash in wildfire smoke” on Sunday. The departmentnotedair quality in many areas had suffered as a result.Accordingto NASA satellite imagery, smoke is also being pushed eastward across the U. S.
Just one fire in Washington, east of the Cascades atJolly Mountainin Kittitas County, was burning 15,000 acres as of Saturday. TheSeattle Timesreportedthat “[r]oads in that area have been closed and about 3,800 homes have received Level 2 and Level 3 evacuation orders. Level 3 is the most urgent notice.” The Eagle Creek fire, burning on both sides of the Columbia River Gorge in Washington and Oregon, has torched 10,000 acres while the Norse Peak Fire in Pierce County has burned 19,000 and prompted evacuation orders. It has beenburningsince the middle of last month.

According to amapposted by the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center, wildfires are hitting various regions in both Washington and Oregon (they were also plaguing the region last month).NewsweekreportedTuesday that on Saturday, over 150 hikers were stranded in Oregon after a man-made fire possibly caused by fireworks gained steam.

Though the hikers are safe,“the fire grew to 3,000 acres overnight that first night. As of the morning of September 5th, the fire had grown significantly and had spotted across the Columbia River into Washington near Archer Mountain,”accordingto a government-issued incident report. Nearby residents have been served a Level 3 evacuation order, meaning rather than simply beingreadyto evacuate, they should evacuate right away.
The fire is nowreportedlycovering 4,800 acres, and nearly 300 personnel are working to contain it. It is being exacerbated by strong winds and high heat.
Larch Mountain and the communities of Dodson, Warrendale, Latourell, Bridal Veil, and East Corbett were all given Level 3 evacuation orders while other areas were upgraded from Level 1 to Level 2 warnings.

Late Sunday evening, the Oregon Weather Servicewarnedthat“[c]onditions will get worse before getting better. Expect rapid westward movement of the fire as strong east winds continue through the night.”Air quality has worsened and some schools inMultnomah County, Cowlitz County, and Lower Columbia, Columbia Gorge were shut down as of Tuesday,Newsweekreported, with others closing early.
Authoritiesexpectthe fire to burn for the rest of September.
“Winds whipped wildfires around western Montana into a renewed fury overnight Saturday into Sunday, briefly trapping firefighters, burning buildings, and forcing new mandatory evacuations.”
One fire outside Seeley Lake in Powell County grew more than 15,000 acres on Sunday, and “seven fires burning near Plains, Trout Creek and Thompson Falls grew large enough Saturday to warrant a takeover by the Western Montana Type II Incident Management Team.”
At one point on Saturday, every part of the state failed to register “good air” quality. Evacuation orders were issued for at least seven different fires. Montana has beenbattling fires since July.
Meanwhile, in California, over 10,000 firefighters have been working to contain 23 large wildfires across the state, theSacramento BeereportedTuesday.“Helena Fire in Trinity County is among the most troublesome, with 72 homes destroyed and more than 11,000 acres consumed about 5 miles northwest of Junction City,”the outlet reported.
Though the fire started last Wednesday, Cal Fire reported Tuesday morning that it was only 14% contained, with close to 1,500 firefighters working to put it out. Officials said it is burning in remote, steep terrain, and nearby residents have been issued evacuation orders.
A smaller fire in Butte County has burned over 4,000 acres and burned 32 homes but is currently 76% contained. Evacuation orders in that area have been lifted.
Lower-intensity fires have also plagued Yosemite and entered a grove of 2,700-year-old Sequoia trees. Thankfully, no trees have been killed so far due to their resilient bark and the less aggressive quality of the blaze.
Fires also raged in Los Angeles over the weekend,burning7,000 acres in what was called the largest wildfire in the county’s history. Flames burned four homes and prompted the evacuations of 700 residents, along with adeclarationof a state of emergency from Governor Jerry Brown on Sunday. That fire is now almost entirely contained.
Due to fires across the state, air quality alerts wereissuedforMariposa, Tuolumne, Mariposa, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare, and Kern counties in California. Fires have beenburningin the state allsummer. The government’s Incident Information System lists30 active firesof various sizes throughout the state.
In Idaho,multiple active firesareplaguingover 200,000 acres of land, with two fires alone scorching over 65,000 acres each so far. Fires in Idaho have beenburningsince July.

Fires are alsoburninginBritish Columbia,Utah, andColorado, though they are on a smaller scale.
Well-placed fears about storms on the Gulf coast are dominating national headlines, but the scourge of wildfires throughout the west is also straining resources, threatening wildlife, prompting vast evacuations, and endangering air quality for millions of people.

"“It is an important day for all the gay and bisexual men who have been convicted under these laws, and their families. The gross indecency legislation ruined the lives and careers of many. For all those who have worked tirelessly to bring about this legislation, it is long overdue, and so we welcome today’s decision,” Paul Martin, chief executive of the LGBT Foundation in Manchester, stated.
Consensual sex between men was not decriminalized in England until 1967, and it was not until 2001 that the age of consent for gay and bisexual men was reduced to 16, bringing it into line with the law governing heterosexuals.
Lord John Sharkey, who has been pushing the government to issue pardons, said approximately 65,000 men had been convicted under the now-repealed laws, of which 15,000 were still alive.
Anyone who had been found guilty of these now-defunct laws would have their names cleared, and for those still living, the offenses would be removed from any criminal record checks via a ""disregard process.""
""It is hugely important that we pardon people convicted of historical sexual offenses who would be innocent of any crime today,"" Justice Minister Sam Gyimah said.
RELATED: U. K. Spy Chief Sorry for Treatment of Gay WWII Codebreaker Alan Turing
The pardon plan has been dubbed ""Turing's Law"" in reference to the brilliant wartime mathematician, Alan Turing, who cracked Nazi Germany's ""unbreakable"" Enigma code.
Turing was stripped of his job and chemically castrated after being convicted of gross indecency in 1952 for having sex with a man. He killed himself two years later at age 41.
After years of campaigning by supporters, including physicist Stephen Hawking, Turing was granted a rare royal pardon from Queen Elizabeth in 2013.",0
"A federal judge overseeing former U. S. Rep. Aaron Schock's political corruption case has tossed a charge alleging the Illinois Republican illegally pocketed thousands of dollars in leftover fees constituents paid for annual meet-and-greets in Washington organized by his office.
The ruling, posted late Monday, dismissed two counts and left 22 other, still-serious charges. But Schock's attorney suggested Tuesday that Judge Colin Bruce's finding buttresses his contention that the overall case against Schock is flimsy.
""What we described ... in earlier pleadings as a house of cards has begun to fall,"" George Terwilliger said in an emailed statement.
The U. S. attorney's office in Springfield declined comment.
The 51-page ruling highlights the separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches in the U. S. Constitution. It said there are risks Schock's prosecution could violate that longstanding principle, which is meant to ensure the independence of each branch.
Prosecutors had alleged that dozens of constituents at a time paid a ""Fly-in Conference Fee"" of $500 or more to Schock's office to cover meals, transportation and other hosting costs. Filings accused Schock of secretly keeping at least $11,000 from one 2014 event.
But to prove the Schock, 36, of Peoria, broke the law by keeping the fees, the Urbana-based judge said prosecutors would have to rely too much on imprecise U. S. House rules and expect the judge to glean what lawmakers had in mind by drawing up the rules as they did.
""This is something which the court may not do,"" he wrote.
The judge also dismissed one count of theft of government funds on grounds it bundled too many alleged crimes into a single charge. The remaining counts are eight of wire fraud, five of falsification of election commission filings, six of filing false income tax returns, two of making false statements and one of mail fraud.
""There are still ample counts for the prosecution,"" explained Jeff Cramer, a former federal prosecutor who is now a Chicago-based managing director of investigations at Berkeley Research Group. ""The prosecution really needs just one count to get to a sentencing.""
A conviction on just one wire fraud count carries a maximum 20-year prison term.
Among the allegations that remain are that Schock illegally sought reimbursement in government funds for lavish spending, including $5,000 on a chandelier for his Washington office, which he was redecorating in the style of the ""Downton Abbey"" TV series.
Schock resigned in 2015 and was indicted in 2016. He has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go to trial on Jan. 22.
Judge Bruce didn't find that prosecutors rely too much on House rules when it came to allegations Schock ran up a $140,000 mileage tab over six years, reimbursements for 150,000 more miles than his vehicles actually traveled. Bruce concluded such an alleged fraud could potentially be proven without reference to legislative rules.
But he added that he could revisit that finding and toss more counts as details emerge in government evidence.",0
"At first glance one might not notice anything particularly odd about the village of Kodinhi. It is a small, remote village located in theMalappuram district in Kerala, India. With only 2,000 families, it is a sleepy, quiet place that one could drive by without giving a second thought. It is a backwater, nondescript village not unlike countless others dotting the Indian countryside.
However, spend enough time walking through its modest streets you may start to notice something peculiar about this village. You may start having a case of seeing double, for there are twins everywhere, of all ages, both identical and fraternal. In fact, there almost seems to be a pair of twins for practically every family in the village.
Kodinhi has the distinction of having the most unusually high rate of twin births in the world. In a village of only 2,000 people, there are reportedly over 220 pairs of twins. It was reported that in 2008 alone, 15 pairs of twins were born in the village. This may not seem like a high number when talking about a big city, but it is bizarrely high for such a small, relatively sparsely populated town.
To put it into perspective, it is said that the rate of twin births globally is around 6 out of every 1,000 live births, whereas in Kodinhi it is more like 42 out of every 1,000 births, a striking contrast to the norm. In fact, the rate of twins in this sleepy, tropical town is around 6 times the global average.
Local doctorKrishnan Sribiju has spent a great deal of time studying the twins of Kodinhi and he believes that the rate of twin births is even higher than official records suggest. He also has found that the rate of twin births in the village is increasing every year, and that the number of twins in Kodinhi has doubled in the past decade.
Dr.Sribiju is also quick to point out that the phenomenal rate of twin births in the village is particularly impressive considering that sub-continantal Asia has a typically lower rate of twin births than most of the world, and India has the lowest twinning rate in Asia. Indeed, generally India has one of the lowest twinning rates in the world, making Kodinhi even more of a curiosity.
It is said that the twinning phenomenon in Kodinhi started around 60 to 70 years ago, and the exact cause remains unknown. Doctors have long been baffled as to why this village has so many twins, and no one as of yet has been able to unravel the mystery. Adding another layer of odd to the puzzle is the fact that even those who marry outsiders and move away from the village exhibit a substantially higher than normal rate of having twins.
Researchers have delved intogenetic, biological, molecular, hereditary and climatic factors and still have not come to a satisfactory conclusion to this enigma. Pollutants or chemical factors have been mostly ruled out since the vast majority of twins born in Kodinhi are perfectly normal and healthy, without birth defects. In addition, artificial insemination or other fertility treatments are not a factor as the villagers are too poor to afford the prohibitively high costs of such procedures. Genetic problems have also mostly been discounted since the effect is localized in this one village.
Dr.Sribiju speculates that the answer lies in something the villagers are eating or drinking, but none has been able to isolate the substance that could be responsible. Further compounding this theory is that the eating habits of the villagers of Kodinhi don’t seem to be any different than other villages in Kerala. Dr.Sribiju has said he plans to continue research in Kodinhi with more detailed biochemical analysis equipment, but for now the abnormal number of twins here remains an unexplained anomaly.
Fortunately for the villagers here, the twinning phenomenon has had no real negative effects except for perhaps people not being able to always quickly ascertain just which twin they are talking to. School teachers here like to joke that they are never sure if a student is really the one attending the class, or their twin. Mistaken identity is probably a real headache here, yet for the most part there have been no health concerns and the village even seems to be proud of their unique status.
In order to bring wider attention to the peculiar problems twins here face, around 30 pairs of twins in the village started an organization called “The Twins and Kins Association.” It is reportedly the first such association of its kind in India and it is hoped that the group will be able to raise awareness of Kodinhi’s plight and the unique lifestyles of twins.
Just what is going on in the remote village of Kodinhi? What is the reason they have so many twins? For now, no one really knows. If you ever find yourself in this village and start seeing double yourself, just remember that it is not just your imagination playing tricks on you.",1
"Philip Hammond says next week's Budget will set out how the government will build 300,000 new homes a year.
But the chancellor said there was no ""single magic bullet"" to increase housing supply and the government would not simply ""pour money in"".
Ministers want to speed up developments where planning permission has been granted and give more help to small building firms, he added.
Labour says ministers ""still have no plan to fix the housing crisis"".
Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show ahead of Wednesday's Budget, the chancellor also said:
""There are no unemployed people"" while discussing the threat to jobs posed by technological change - when pressed later, he said the government hadn't forgotten the 1.4m who are unemployed
* The government was ""on the brink"" of making ""some serious movement forward"" in the Brexit negotiations
* Ministers would not withdraw a controversial bid to enshrine the exact Brexit date in law
* The health service will not face ""Armageddon"" if it is not given a 4bn funding boost demanded by the boss of NHS England
The shortage of housing is expected to be one of the themes of the Budget, with Mr Hammond under pressure to ease the difficulties faced by first-time buyers trying to get a deposit.
He said it was ""not acceptable"" that young people find it so hard to buy a home, and promised to set out how the government would keep its ""pledge to the next generation"".
He did not commit to the 50bn reportedly being demanded by Communities Secretary Sajid Javid to finance a house-building drive, but committed to the target of 300,000 new homes in England.
He insisted the government was delivering new homes at record levels, with 217,350 ""additional dwellings"" in England last year, but acknowledged more needed to be done.
Focusing on sites where planning permission has been granted, he said the government would use the ""powers of state"" to get ""missing homes built"".
It also plans to pay to clean up polluted industrial sites for house building, get town hall bosses to allocate small pockets of land to small developers and guarantee loans by banks to small house builders.
The chancellor's Budget speech is also expected to include:
* 160m for next-generation 5G mobile networks across the UK
* 100m for an additional 8,000 fully-qualified computer science teachers supported by a new National Centre for Computing
* A retraining partnership between the TUC (Trade Union Congress), CBI (Confederation of British Industry) and the government
The chancellor is also expected to announce regulation changes to allow developers to apply to test driverless vehicles - and revealed he would be testing one out in the West Midlands on Monday.
The government is aiming for fully driverless cars - with no safety attendant on board - to be on the road in four years.
""Some would say that's a bold move but I believe we have to embrace these technologies, we have to take up these challenges, if we want to see Britain leading the next industrial revolution,"" Mr Hammond added.
Challenged on the impact of wider automation on people's jobs, he went on to say: ""I remember 20 years ago we were worrying about what was going to happen to the million shorthand typists in Britain as the personal computer took over.
""Well nobody has a shorthand typist these days, but where are all these unemployed people?
""There are no unemployed people.""
Asked to clarify his remark later in the interview, he said the government was ""getting people into work at a remarkable rate"" and that it had not forgotten the 1.4m unemployed people in the UK.
In a later interview with ITV's Peston, he said: ""The point I was making is previous waves of technological change have not resulted in millions of people being long-term unemployed.""
Also appearing on Marr, Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell defended his own plans to borrow 250bn over 10 years to invest in capital projects and renationalise several key industries, saying his proposals would allow the UK to ""compete in a global market"".
""When you invest those sums you get a return on that investment that covers any cost of borrowing,"" he said.

"The Department of Justice has overruled a federal court ruling and temporarily halted Dakota Access Pipeline construction on Army Corps of Engineering lands.
The DoJ arrived at the decision on Friday following a federal court’s controversial decision to allow Energy Transfer Partners to continue construction on the pipeline.
Their statement says the decision will take effect until the Army “can determine whether it will need to reconsider any of its previous decisions regarding the Lake Oahe site under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) or other federal laws.”
Therefore, construction of the pipeline on Army Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe will not go forward at this time. The Army will move expeditiously to make this determination, as everyone involved — including the pipeline company and its workers — deserves a clear and timely resolution. In the interim, we request that the pipeline company voluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west of Lake Oahe.
This development comes on the heels of North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple’s decision to activate the state’s National Guard on Thursday, stoking fears that tensions on the ground could grow. Currently, Native American protesters, or “water protectors,” are staging a peaceful blockade against the pipeline’s construction.
The Justice Department statement’s language could be interpreted as a “voluntary” request to the pipeline builders, and it’s unclear whether Energy Transfer Partners will comply with the request.
Meanwhile, opposition on the ground to the Dakota Access Pipelinecontinues to swell as thousands of water protectors continue to stream into the area to join the blockade. At this time it remains unclear how the addition of the National Guard, a flood of reinforcements to the protests, and the Justice Department’s statement will affect tensions on the ground.
In recent days, we have seen thousands of demonstrators come together peacefully, with support from scores of sovereign tribal governments, to exercise their First Amendment rights and to voice heartfelt concerns about the environment and historic, sacred sites. It is now incumbent on all of us to develop a path forward that serves the broadest public interest.",1
"Akio Toyoda bowed twice during his apology to car owners in Beijing Monday, two more times than he bowed during his just completed trip to the U. S. China is now the world's largest car market, and Toyota's top executive needs the good will of Chinese consumers if he hopes to catch up with the booming sales of other foreign car makers.
""All these problems make Chinese consumers very unhappy and we are really sorry,"" Toyoda told 300 Chinese reporters gathered in a Beijing hotel. ""We love China, so we will try our best to produce quality cars for the Chinese people.""
Toyoda came to Beijing directly from Washington, where he had testified before the House Oversight Committee. While Committee chair Rep. Ed Towns, D.-N. Y., said Friday that Toyota had withheld crucial information, Toyoda had a more positive spin on his experience before Congress.
He told the Chinese press that he was grateful for the chance to address Congress, explain his position and apologize to American consumers. ""I told the hearing about our future measures,"" he said, ""and I am not sure if American consumers will accept what I said, but I talked to many consumers who told me they would still buy Toyota vehicles.""
Toyoda, who before taking the helm of the company in 2009 worked in overseas sales and was the first president of Toyota China, said it was important for him to extend his apology in person both to Chinese consumers via local media and to government officials with whom he met today.
The Chinese market is still small for Toyota, with sales of 700,000 in 2009 compared to 1.5 million in the U. S. But being a player here is seen as important to maintaining a strong global position, and Toyota's image problems come at a time when other foreign car manufacturers are increasing sales by as 87 percent a year in China. Sales for Toyota rose a relatively anemic 20 percent last year.
Toyoda said that the company will not change its sales target of 800,000 for 2010. ""We hope the speed of the recall measures will restore the confidence of the Chinese consumer...and that the Chinese people will believe in us,"" he said.
Toyota was forced to recall over 75,000 RAV4's and numerous other models in China in the past year, a number that pales in comparison to the millions recalled in the U. S. The reasons the recalls were smaller in China is that Chinese Toyotas do not use the floor mats or accelerator pedals implicated in the two biggest U.S. Toyota recalls.
When asked by a reporter whether or not Toyota cars made in Japan were better quality than those for the international market, Toyoda put to use his knowledge of Chinese cuisine. ""To some extent cars are products that are varied, made suitable for different consumers. Like food, mapu tofu (a dish popular in China), flavors can be different depending on where it is made, but quality-wise our products are all the same.""
A handful of angry Chinese consumers gathered outside a Beijing hotel as Toyota President Akio Toyoda addressed 300 Chinese reporters in Beijing.
Since his U.S. Congressional testimony last week, Toyoda has undoubtedly been fine-tuning his message. His damage control mission is only getting started and Toyoda is clearly hoping his explanation and apology will be better received here than it was in the U.S.

"(CNN) — Volumes have been published about palm-peppered islands and sugar-coated beaches of tropical Thailand, their writers waxing lyrical about pillow-soft sand and crystalline waters. But with so many coastal choices, it can be a challenge to pick the perfect stretch of sand.
Seasonal weather definitely has a bearing on destination decisions.
The best bet for sunshine on the west coast (Andaman Sea) is November to April; while on the east coast (Gulf of Thailand), it's January to September.
Veteran Thai travelers always check ahead before heading to lesser-visited destinations -- many hotels, resorts and restaurants in non-A-list places close for the low season.
Choosing a full-service beachside base camp to begin a journey is a smart approach. You can strike out from any number of such bases by using the network of ferries that connect Thailand's islands:
Base camp: Trang or Satun

Koh Mook's Tham Morakot (Morakot Cave) can be accessed only through an 80-meter-long tunnel during low tide, which leads to an open-air chamber surrounded by overgrown cliffs.
To fully appreciate the white sand inside the sea cave and for the emerald green of the pool to really dazzle, visit on a sunny day.
Activities include dugong sighting trips off Koh Libong; island-hopping and stopping off to see the iconic stone arch at Koh Kai; visiting Koh Hin Ngam, a tiny island covered with polished black stones, where a sign warns that a curse will fall on those who remove any pebbles.
There are waterfalls on Koh Adang and Koh Tarutao, the latter with two prison ruins. Trekkers can hit the trails through the interiors of Koh Ngai (aka Koh Hai) and Koh Sukorn.
For rock climbing and bouldering -- previously only associated with Krabi -- Koh Lao Liang is starting to attract enthusiasts with operators such as Andaman Adventures offering personalized itineraries.

Tartutao National Marine Park encompasses 51 islands in Southern Thailand.

Tarutao National Marine Park consists of the Tarutao and Adang-Rawi archipelagos, the latter of which is home to the increasingly popular Koh Lipe.
The islands of the Petra archipelago are split between Trang and Satun provinces, and include Koh Libong, Koh Bulon Lae and the twin islands of Koh Lao Liang.
Between them, the two marine national parks include more than 80 islands with countless beaches to discover.
With most of the islands protected under national marine park status, visitors have their pick for scuba diving, snorkeling or just plain lazing on the sand.
It should be noted that the overall lack of tourist development means most of the islands don't have electricity around the clock, nor ATMs, but they do come with bucket-loads of tropical idyll.
Party
There really isn't a nightlife scene to speak of on the offshore islands of the coastal provinces of Satun and north-bordering Trang, with the exception of perhaps Pattaya Beach on Koh Lipe.
Stay
International hotel brands don't have a presence here, but there are plenty of lovely independent hotels, from the hip Idyllic Concept Resort on Koh Lipe and Koh Mook Sivalai to the rustic luxury of the Seven Seas Resort on Koh Kradan.
Basic national park accommodation on Koh Tarutao, Koh Adang and Koh Petra, starting from $15 (500 baht) per night, can be booked 60 days in advance through the Department of National Parks website.

Water activities abound at all the main beaches in Phuket, be it parasailing, jet skiing, or even kitesurfing off Kata Beach.
From scuba diving around the Similan Islands (one of the best locations in Asia) to snorkeling day trips to Koh Hae, the underwater scenery in Andaman waters can be spectacular if you know where and when to look.
During the November to April high season, snorkelers can explore the coral right off the shores of Kata Yai beach in Phuket.
During the rainier ""green"" season, the waters around nearby Koh Racha provide better clarity.
Professional operators such as Siam Dive n' Sail offer liveaboards and yacht charters to explore the teeming waters.
Dotted with limestone outcrops, Ton Sai and Railay are popular rock climbing destinations. The island of Koh Yao Noi follows close behind for vertical rock face escapades. These places offer a different vantage point on Krabi's theatrical seascape.
And, of course, ""The Beach"" was filmed at Koh Phi Phi. To get that quintessential tourist shot, walk up to the viewpoint on Phi Phi Don and snap a few frames of the double-crescent beaches.
Keep in mind Similan Islands National Park is closed from May to November each year, making it off limits to tourists.
Chill
Phuket beaches include Kata Noi and Karon beach.

Especially during high season, local Thai families head to Sirinath National Park along Nai Yang Beach to picnic beneath the shade of the casuarinas trees and escape Phuket's crowded beaches.
The relative difficulty of reaching Haad Hin Kluay (aka Banana Beach) via a narrow and steep-ish dirt road (400 or so meters from luxury resort Trisara) makes it a viable option for those wanting to chill on the beach.
If you want to spend your whole vacation in quiet surroundings, Koh Lanta, Koh Yao Yai/Noi or even Phang Nga province are interesting alternatives.
Another easy option is to charter a long-tail boat for the day and ask the captain to take you to a secluded beach on one of the smaller uninhabited islands in the Andaman Sea.
Party
Phuket is Thailand's largest island and has several nightlife enclaves.
Bangla Road runs perpendicular inland from the sea-hugging Taweewong Road and is lined largely with red-tinted joints -- exceptions include Seduction Beach Club and Disco.
Bangla then crosses Rat-u-thit Road, also home to a few places to frolic. For a lower key night without the distraction of professional ladies, Phuket Town's popular watering holes include Sanaeha and Ka Jok See.
Nightlife in Krabi is focused on Ao Nang, with popular beach bars including The Last Fisherman, a handful of merry-making spots in Centre Point entertainment complex and Luna Bar, just around the corner on Nopparat Thara Beach.
During high season, the nocturnal scene at Railay, just south of Ao Nang on the other side of the limestone outcrops, picks up with versions of full moon, half moon, and black moon parties complete with fire dancing. Most of the action takes place on Railay East.
Fans take note. The odd global celeb has been known to check into Phuket's Sri Panwa.
Stay
Beachfront and sea view digs are highly coveted on Phuket. If you want to go cheap, head to an inland hotel such as Chinotel.
Baan Krating on Ao Sane Beach effectively has a private stretch of beach, but if you want to drop big bucks for the chance to rub shoulders with the jet set, Amanpuri and Sri Panwa are prime choices.
Accommodation in Krabi is almost as varied, ranging from Ao Nang's Glur Hostel and Railay Phutawan Resort up to the legendary Rayavadee and Pulay Bay, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve.

Ang Thong Marine National Park, about 30 kilometers northwest of Koh Samui, is made up of more than 40 small islands.
Closest airport: Samui International Airport (USM)
Radial islands: Koh Phan Ngan, Koh Tao, Koh Nangyuan, Angthong Archipelago

The ubiquity of bronzed bodies stuffed in wet suits gives it away -- Koh Tao is a PADI paradise, reportedly overshadowed only by Australia's Cairns when it comes to issuing the most dive certifications in the world.
Professional dive centers such as Planet Scuba and Big Blue Diving offer courses and trips to varying sites depending on the season, while Good Time Adventures also makes Koh Tao's granite boulders their playground for climbing and abseiling.
Though kayaking is a run-of-the-mill sport in this part of the world, the experience of paddling through the 42-island maze of the Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park is unbeatable.
There are a few fanned bungalows via the Department of National Parks on the archipelago's headquarters on Wua Talap. Unless you're honing your mosquito-whisperer skills, however, a day trip would more than suffice.
For visitors preferring to stay dry, Bophut on Koh Samui has the liveliest of the island's walking streets, with vendors vying for attention alongside the gamut of restaurants and bars down the cute sea-fronting Fisherman's Village street.

With clear water lapping up on both sides of the sandbank connecting the three islets that collectively make up Koh Nangyuan, ""nothing"" is usually the order of the day, with lazy snorkeling right off the alabaster shoreline just about the only activity.
On Koh Phan Ngan, Haad Yuan on the eastern coast is a quiet stretch of beach that backs onto forested hills, fronted by comfortably swimmable shores.
A sprinkling of bungalows and resorts have sprung up in recent years, but with rocky outcroppings on both ends of the beach, it remains fairly tranquil, accessible only by boat and a not oft-used mountain footpath.
Party
Chaweng on Koh Samui is the epicenter of sea, sand and shopping during the day, and also where debauchees descend at night.
Ground zero is the Green Mango strip, where there's plenty of space in the clubs to move, with the nearby and unassuming Hendrix Bar on Soi Solo the preferred spot to de-bass and re-hydrate till the light hours of the morning.
Over on Koh Phan Ngan, the full moon parties with their cult-like notoriety, need little introduction. Once a month, hedonists and the plain mad numbering in the tens of thousands flock to Haad Rin beach to party as though tomorrow has been cancelled.
Koh Phan Ngan has a few options for luxury seekers, like the Anantara Rasananda. Not a bad place to recover from a full moon party.
For less mainstream revelry -- considered by some to rival the full mooners -- Ban Tai hosts fortnightly half moon parties, held a week before and after the full moon shindigs.
Stay
Koh Samui is a great spot for accommodation.

As the country's third largest island, Koh Samui has by far the most varied options for accommodation.
Luxury offerings include global brands such as Four Seasons, Conrad, Banyan Tree and InterContinental, as well as independent hotels such as Hansar and The Tongsai Bay.
Cheaper options include Ark Bar Jungle Club.
Both of Koh Phan Ngan's fancy digs --- Rasananda Anantara and Santhiya --- are located at the beautiful Thong Nai Pan beach on the northeast coast.
Bungalow resorts abound in just about every nook on the island, including Salad Hut and Stone Hill Resort, both along the sunset coast.
On Kao Tao, rustic cottages at Charmchuree Villa are spread among stunning environs. Just a 15-minute boat ride away, the sole resort on Koh Nangyuan lets you call dibs on a sun spot before the camera-wielding day trippers descend.

From the privately owned Koh Rayang to the flat Koh Kradat, booking an island-hopping tour is a good way to see this oft-overlooked section of the Gulf of Thailand.
For divers and snorkelers, the water around the Koh Rang islands are best, with idyllic beaches also found on Koh Kra and Koh Rang Yai, both part of the archipelago.
With a low-key, local feel, Koh Mak is small enough to walk around in a few hours. Just off the northwest coast is Koh Kham, which can be easily reached by kayak or on foot via a sandbar during low tide.
There are also a number of waterfalls hidden amid the forested interior of these islands, best visited during the rainy low season. Among the more popular cascades (Koh Chang Archipelago National Park; entrance fee applicable) are Than Mayom and Klong Phlu on Koh Chang, and Klong Chao on Koh Kood.
Chill
Just off the bottom tip of Koh Chang is Koh Wai, a small island with a smattering of bungalows along its northern shore.
From the pier near Good Feeling Resort, the beach stretches in both directions. It can get relatively busy with visitors from other islands.
Koh Kood, the fourth largest island in Thailand and the furthest east in the province of Trat's waters, has been bestowed with the moniker, ""Maldives of Thailand.""
In recent years, a couple of high-end resorts have moved in, but due to the distance from the mainland, the island's beaches remain empty.

As the largest of some 52 islands in the Koh Chang Archipelago National Park, and second largest island in Thailand, Koh Chang is where the local party is found, namely on White Sand Beach (Haad Sai Khao) and the misleadingly named Lonely Beach (Haad Tha Nam).
Toward the northern end and finer sand of White Sand Beach is popular 15 Palms, a chilled-out beachside bar and restaurant, which also serves up a generous surf 'n turf barbecue buffet every night.
The always happening Sabay Bar features a live band and fire shows on the beach, while Oodies Place is usually abuzz with blues aficionados and regular patrons looking for a jamming night out.
Further down along the west coast, a distinctive bohemian vibe can still be felt at Lonely Beach (think bungalows and buckets), with nightly parties all down the block.
Among the most popular venues are Siam Hut, Ting Tong Bar and monthly black moon parties hosted by Om-Bar.

"Taylor Swift has rallied behind fellow pop star Kesha by donating $250,000 to the ""Tik Tok"" singer as she continues her legal battle to end her contract with record producer who goes by the name ""Dr. Luke.""
""In a show of support, Taylor Swift has donated $250,000 to Kesha to help with any of her financial needs during this trying time,"" a representative for Swift told NBC News on Monday.
The gift from the ""Shake It Off"" songstress follows a setback in Kesha's bid to break her professional relationship with producer Dr. Luke, whom she has accused of sexually assaulting her.
A judge on Friday denied Kesha's bid to end the contract with Dr. Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald. Kesha has accused Gottwald of drugging and raping her and abusing her in an effort to get her to lose weight.
Gottwald denies the allegations, saying Kesha. 28, is lying in an effort to break her contract. He has not been charged with a crime. The 42-year-old producer and songwriter has worked with artists including Katy Perry, Rihanna, Pitbull, Miley Cyrus and Kelly Clarkson.
Kesha Rose Sebert was an 18-year-old unknown from Nashville when she signed a contract with one of his companies in 2005, according to court papers.
Five years later, ""Tik Tok"" was the No. 1 song in the country. She has released two albums, most recently in 2012.
Kesha continues to play some shows, but her lawyers say her career is essentially being held hostage because she refuses to work with her accused rapist, and he is retaliating because she spoke up.
Friday's court decision is not the final word in the case, but an outpouring of support on social media followed from celebrities and fans, many who used the hashtag #FreeKesha.",0

British Fireball Sparks Grim Warning Of December 2012 Direct Hit
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
A grim report issued by General Director Vladimir Popovkin of the Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS) on the huge meteorite fireball seen across nearly the entire length of Britain [photo 2nd left] this weekend past warns that this event is but a precursor to an expected hit upon Earth this coming December by a rogue asteroid currently barreling its way towards us.
The rogue asteroid noted in this report is 2012 DA14 having an estimated diameter of about 44 meters and an estimated mass of about 120,000 metric tons. It was discovered last month on 23 February 2012 by the OAM Observatory La Sagra in Spain with initial NASA calculations showing that on 15 February 2013 the distance between it and the Earth only will be 0.07 LD (27,000 km; 17,000 mi) which puts it between us and most of our orbiting satellites.
The estimated size of 2012 DA14 places it in the same category as the celestial body that, Russian scientists say, exploded over western Siberia in 1908. Though many theories exist concerning the event on Podkamennaya Tunsguska River, the leading explanation is a space body over 50 meters in size blew up in the atmosphere, the blast being at least 1,000 more powerful than the nuclear bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.
General Director Popovkin in this report disputes NASAs calculation of a 15 February 2013 near miss of our Earth by 2012 DA14 by noting that American scientists failed to account for what is called the Yarkovsky Effect that affects the angular spin rate of asteroids based upon our planets magnetic field that caused an over 5,000 km deviation from calculated models of the aforementioned meteorite fireball seen over Britain.
The Yarkovsky Effect is better described as a force acting on a rotating body in space caused by the anisotropic emission of thermal photons, which carry momentum. It is usually considered in relation to meteoroids or small asteroids (about 10 cm to 10 km in diameter) as its influence is most significant for these bodies and was discovered by Russian civil engineer Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky (18441902).
This report, however, notes that the Yarkovsky Effect can be applied to larger space bodies (meteors, asteroids, comets), including 2012 DA14, should our Earths electromagnetic field be severely disrupted due to solar storms caused by our Sun.  This is an important distinction to note, this report continues, in making calculations for 2012 DA14 particularly during a time period when our Sun is in Solar Maximum and where just hours ago it unleashed one of the most powerful Earth-directed X-flares of this cycle.
Russian concerns about these types of rogue space bodies were heightened in December 2009 when former ROSCOSMOS General Director Anatoly Perminov warned that preparations were urgently needed to prevent a strike upon our Earth in 2029 or 2036 by the asteroid 99942Apophis and stated: People's lives are at stake. We should pay several hundred million dollars and build a system that would allow us to prevent a collision, rather than sit and wait for it to happen and kill hundreds of thousands of people.
Even more critical to note, this report says, and as we had reported on in our 26 February report Mysterious Siberian Blasts Warned Point To Rapid Pole Reversal, a substantial deviation in the trajectory of 2012 DA14 causing it to rapidly accelerate towards our Earth could be further caused by our planets weakening magnetic field due to a reversal of our poles and that reports from all over the world are now hearing evidence of.
Interesting to note about these mysterious sounds being heard the world over are that they are now being attributed to electromagnetic noise emitted from auroras and radiation belts by University of Saskatchewan physics professor Jean-Pierre St. Maurice.
Not being mentioned in this report, of course, are the many ancient writings explaining that in the end of days all types of mysterious sounds from the sky (like those being heard now) would occur heralding a time of great destruction and chaos, including the Bibles Book of Revelations warning that the beginning of the end of our age would be sounded by seven angels blowing their trumpets.
Also not being mentioned in this report is 2012 DA14 expected to maybe hit our planet in December of this year, a date that eerily corresponds with the Mayan Calendar [photo bottom left] prediction of an apocalypse due to occur on the 21st day of that month, and which is just over 9 months away.
Important to note about the Mayan Calendar is that it begins on 11 August 3114 BC and ends on 21 December 2012, a time span of over 5,000 years  accurately noting past, and predicting future celestial alignments covering a period of over 26,000 years called the Precession of the Equinoxes. What no one has yet to explain, however, is how, or why, a backward civilization like the Mayans, who hadnt even invented a wheel, were able to accomplish such an amazing feat.
Western scientists state that the Mayans accuracy lies in their diligent observations of the sky, but fail to explain how a civilization that existed for less than 3,000 years (2,000 BC-900AD) were able to see both into the ancient past, and the far off future, making accurate descriptions of celestial alignments not equaled until modern times. Simple logic would, therefore, dictate that in the absence of an answer to these questions one should at least consider what the Mayans themselves said about why they made this calendar and from where they received their information from.
According to the Mayans, in their own written words, and exactly like the Inca civilization of Peru said of their knowledge too, they told of numerous visiting gods that would come and go in flying fire balls from outer space or beneath the sea, the most important being Quetzalcoatl, a tall white skinned, blonde hair, blue eyed humanoid with a beard (depicted as a feathered serpent), was the last of the gods to leave the Western Hemisphere who like Jesus, Mohammad, and all the other gods taught principles of peace and kindness to this part of the world.
Most importantly about these gods, and as it pertains to this report, are that the Mayans predicted their gods would return on 21 December 2012 thus making 2012 DA14 (perhaps) not an asteroid at all but a transport vehicle from the Pleiades Star System (aka The Seven Sisters) these celestial beings told the Mayan and Inca peoples they came from.
To whatever the outcome of these events may be it is not in our knowing, other than to mention the obvious that as our world plunges further into chaos by the day, and as cataclysms and destruction seem to await us at every turn, it would behoove the wisest ones to gain as much knowledge as possible, even if it is from ancient myths and legends.  After all, even though the experts disparage these ancient myths and legends they have yet to explain why all of sudden around 5,000 years ago every civilization on Earth began building pyramids that even today we are not able to duplicate.
The ancients told us whyour world today just hasnt listened.

"THERE are some religious-freedom arguments where even the time-honoured principle of “live and let live” fails to provide democracies with any easy answers. One such dispute concerns animal slaughter. It is an issue which can create unlikely coalitions, uniting Muslims and Jews (who share certain beliefs about how animals should be killed for meat) against an odd combination of animal-lovers, secularists and the nationalist right.
Belgium, a country which has more than its share of inter-faith and inter-communal tensions, is the latest place where slaughter methods have come under scrutiny. The legislature in Belgium’s French-speaking south has just voted to ban the killing of animals without stunning (ie, anaesthetising) them first. According to classic Muslim or Jewish teaching, animals should be killed by a single cut to the throat, administered while the beast is in a healthy state. Representatives of Belgium’s 40,000 Jews and 600,000 or more Muslims said the vote sent an extremely negative signal to religious minorities.
Although the matter is highly sensitive for both faiths, Muslim religious authorities have in recent times allowed slightly more room for compromise. Some Islamic legal pundits accept the idea of prior stunning as long as the animal remains healthy before the blood is drained. In other words, the stunning must be light and death must still be caused by rapid blood-letting.
That grey area helps to explain a proposal adopted by the main parties in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking north of Belgium, in March. As of 2019, they resolved, it should be illegal in that region to slaughter smaller animals such as sheep and chickens without prior stunning. For cattle, however, it is harder to administer a stunning blow without also causing death. So the Flemish politicians resolved that cattle should be stunned immediately after the throat-cutting, until such time as a reliable method of non-lethal stunning before bleeding was developed.
Doubtless that was seen as an attempt to meet religious concerns half-way. However the response from both the affected religions to developments across Belgium has still been grumpy. Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, called the francophones’ move “the greatest assault on Jewish religious rights in Belgium since the Nazi occupation of the country in the second world war”.
European Union law generally requires stunning before slaughter but it allows member states to make exceptions for religious communities. American law and jurisprudence also make explicit provision for killing animals according to religious precepts. But Sweden and Denmark, both EU members, insist on anaesthetising before slaughter. Residents of those countries who want meat that is produced with other procedures must import it from elsewhere. Soon, it seems, Muslims and Jews in Belgium will be in a similar position. By contrast, Germany’s constitutional court has upheld the right of people to slaughter beasts in accordance with their religious beliefs.
The gallery of characters and organisations that have weighed into this debate is impressive. David Cameron, Britain’s former prime minister, once said he would have no objection to eating halal meat, produced according to Islamic principles. In 2015, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) vowed to ban slaughter without stunning. UKIP’s current leader Paul Nuttall has backed off that pledge but a ban is still favoured by some of that party’s senior members. Marine Le Pen, the defeated candidate in this month’s French presidential election, is another politician of the nationalist right who supports a ban on killing without stunning.
In Britain, non-stun slaughter is opposed on ethical grounds by the British Veterinary Association (whch gathered more than 100,000 signatures in support of its view), and also by the National Secular Society, whose campaign director Stephen Evans says that “in 21st-century Europe, there is no good reason why animal welfare should be subservient to religious dietary rules.”
In many European countries, the debate is particularly charged because many initiatives to ban religiously based slaughter, both during the Nazi era and well before it, had an unmistakably anti-Semitic tinge. Slaughter by the shechita (traditional Jewish) method was outlawed in Germany soon after Adolf Hitler came to power. But there is also one example of a powerful Jewish voice which was raised in opposition to all animal slaughter: the writer and Nobel laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer, who was a staunch vegetarian. He once said: “As long as human beings go on shedding the blood of animals, there will never be any peace. There is only one little step from killing animals to creating gas chambers.”",0
"Fracking may worsen asthma in children and adults who live near sites where the oil and gas drilling method is used, according to an 8-year study in Pennsylvania.
The study found that asthma treatments were as much as four times more common in patients living closer to areas with more or bigger active wells than those living far away.
But the study did not establish that fracking directly caused or worsened asthma. There's also no way to tell from the study whether asthma patients exposed to fracking fare worse than those exposed to more traditional gas drilling methods or to other industrial activities.
Fracking refers to hydraulic fracturing, a technique for extracting oil and gas by injecting water, sand and chemicals into wells at high pressure to crack rock. Environmental effects include exhaust, dust and noise from heavy truck traffic transporting water and other materials, and from drilling rigs and compressors. Fracking and improved drilling methods led to a boom in production of oil and gas in several U. S. states, including Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado.
Sara Rasmussen, the study's lead author and a researcher at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, said pollution and stress from the noise caused by fracking might explain the results. But the authors emphasized that the study doesn't prove what caused patients' symptoms.
More than 25 million U. S. adults and children have asthma, a disease that narrows airways in the lungs. Symptoms include wheezing, breathing difficulties and chest tightness, and they can sometimes flare up with exposure to dust, air pollution and stress.
Previous research has found heavy air pollution in areas where oil and gas drilling is booming.
Industry groups responding to the new research said air samplings measured by Pennsylvania authorities near natural gas operations during some of the study years found pollutant levels unlikely to cause health issues. But samplings were limited and didn't reflect potential cumulative effects of emissions from the drilling sites.
The new study was published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.
The researchers noted that between 2005 and 2012, more than 6,200 fracking wells were drilled in Pennsylvania. They used electronic health records to identify almost 36,000 asthma patients treated during that time in the Geisinger Health System, which covers more than 40 counties in Pennsylvania. Evidence of asthma attacks included new prescriptions for steroid medicines, emergency-room treatment for asthma and asthma hospitalizations.
Related: EPA Says Fracking Has No Widespread Effect on Drinking Water
During the study, there were more than 20,000 new oral steroid prescriptions ordered, almost 5,000 asthma hospitalizations and almost 2,000 ER asthma visits.
Those outcomes were 50 percent to four times more common in asthma patients living closer to areas with more or bigger active wells than among those living far away.
The highest risk for asthma attacks occurred in people living a median of about 12 miles from drilled wells. The lowest risk was for people living a median of about 40 miles away.
Dr. Norman H. Edelman, senior scientific adviser for the American Lung Association, called the study ""interesting and provocative."" But he said it only shows an association between fracking and asthma, not a ""cause and effect,"" and that more rigorous research is needed.
""Asthma is a huge problem,"" he said. ""Anything we can do to elucidate the causes will be very useful.""",0
"HELENA, Mont. — Winds wreaked havoc on wildfires that were threatening two crown jewels of the National Park Service on Monday, pushing the flames toward manmade and natural icons in and around Glacier and Yosemite national parks.
The wind-driven fires, combined with high temperatures and dry conditions, have disrupted holiday travel and hampered firefighters across the West during a Labor Day weekend that capped a devastating summer in which an area larger than Rhode Island has burned.
The dozens of fires burning across the West and Canada have blanketed the air with choking smoke from Oregon, where ash fell on the town of Cascade Locks, to Colorado, where health officials issued an air quality advisory alert.
A fire in Montana's Glacier National Park emptied the park's busiest tourist spot as wind gusts drove the blaze toward the doorstep of a century old lodge. The 14-square-mile (36-square-kilometers) fire that consumed a historic Glacier backcountry chalet last week was about a mile away from Lake McDonald Lodge, a 103-year-old Swiss chalet-style hotel.
The lodge's setting on the lake as the Going-to-the-Sun-Road begins its vertigo-inducing climb up the Continental Divide has made it an endearing park symbol for many visitors, and it's the jumping-off point for hikes, boat rides, horseback riding and tours in old-fashioned buses known as jammers.
Rangers evacuated tourists and residents from 55 homes near the lake on Sunday as firefighters laid hoses and sprinklers around the hotel. On Monday, fire crews got bad news: The wind had shifted and gusts were driving the fire down the mountainside toward the lake's shores.
Losing Lake McDonald Lodge on top of the destruction of Sperry Chalet last week would be ""unimaginably devastating,"" said Mark Hufstetler, a historian who worked at the lodge for several years in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
""These are some of the most remarkable buildings anywhere in the United States and they are an integral part of the Glacier experience and the Glacier tradition,"" Hufstetler said. ""If they did not exist, that experience and that tradition would not exist, either.""
Fire crews understood the significance of the lodge and were ready to protect it, said fire information officer Diane Sine.
""It's important to all of us and a very high priority to do whatever we can to preserve that,"" she said.
Outside California's Yosemite National Park, a wind-fueled fire on Sunday drove deeper into a grove of 2,700-year-old giant sequoia trees. Officials said the fire had gone through about half the grove, and had not killed any trees.
Giant sequoias are resilient and can withstand low intensity fires. The blaze burned low-level brush and left scorch marks on some big trees that survived, said Cheryl Chipman, a fire information officer.
""They have thick bark and made it through pretty well,"" Chipman said.
There are about 100 giant sequoias in the grove, including the roughly 24-story-high Bull Buck sequoia, one of the world's largest. Fire crews also wrapped 19th-century cabins in shiny, fire-resistant material to protect them from the flames.
The fire threatening the grove was one of several in the area — one of which closed some trails in Yosemite. A road leading to the park's southern entrance was also closed.

Brenda Negley woke up Monday in her Oakhurst home 14 miles away and found her truck covered with ash. Her mother was there, too, after evacuating her own home, but Negley's thoughts were with the peaceful and secluded grove that she has regularly visited since childhood.
""I've been sick with worry over Nelder Grove,"" she said. ""As much as Nelder Grove is my home, and I don't want to lose my home, I want to save my mom's home and everyone else's home.""
Elsewhere in Northern California, a fire destroyed 72 homes and forced the evacuation of about 2,000 people from their houses. The fire has burned 14 square miles (36 square kilometers) in the community of Helena about 150 miles south of the Oregon border.
In Los Angeles, a fire that destroyed four homes and threatened hillside neighborhoods is no longer actively burning, but firefighters remained at the scene in case the wind reignited the blaze, Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas said.
Still, Terrazas said Monday that wind conditions could re-ignite the blaze, so fire officials were not reducing the number of firefighters at the scene.

"TUMACO, Colombia – Faiber Sabogal, un campesino de 29 aos, se recuperaba de dos heridas sentado en el porche de su casa, en la vereda El Tandil, ubicada en una zona selvática muy cerca de la frontera con Ecuador. Seis días antes, el 5 de octubre, una bala de fusil entró por la espalda de Faiber y salió por su abdomen, disparada a unos cincuenta metros de distancia.
“Yo iba corriendo lejos de los policías, pero el tiro me alcanzó y caí al suelo”, dijo mientras recordaba la protesta de cocaleros en la que resultó herido, y en la que al menos seis de sus vecinos murieron.
El Tandil es una vereda silenciosa perdida entre la selva, con casas hechas de tablas y latón, repartidas entre lomas surcadas por verdes sembradíos de coca. Los campesinos sobreviven casi aislados en una zona rural que pertenece al municipio de Tumaco, un puerto pesquero junto al Pacífico, en el departamento de Nario, uno de los más pobres de Colombia.
Durante los últimos aos, esta zona fértil que podría generar cultivos variados ha recibido a miles de campesinos desplazados que huían de los combates entre el ejército y las Farc. Muchos de ellos, como Faiber, llegaron desde el vecino departamento de Caquetá, también rural, con las manos vacías y decididos a cosechar la única hoja factible.
Hoy la coca, más rentable que cualquier otro cultivo, sigue creciendo en Colombia, y Tumaco es el municipio que hace el mayor aporte a esa industria: 23.148 hectáreas, de las 188.000 hectáreas de coca a escala nacional que acaba de contar la Administración para el Control de las Drogas de los Estados Unidos (DEA, por su sigla en inglés).
Para detener este auge, el gobierno de Juan Manuel Santos implementó en mayo el Programa Nacional Integral de Sustitución de Cultivos de Uso Ilícito, después de llegar a un acuerdo de paz con las Farc —que solían dominar la explotación cocalera— para erradicar y sustituir cien mil hectáreas del arbusto durante el primer ao de aplicación del programa.
Este programa, según un informe de la Fundación Ideas para la Paz, ha firmado acuerdos individuales y colectivos que beneficiarían a más de 140.000 familias en distintas regiones del país, con apoyo técnico y financiero que permitiría a los campesinos cambiar de rubro.
Pero esa promesa no se ha cumplido. La FIP, un centro de pensamiento independiente, fundado en 1999 por un grupo de empresarios colombianos, dice en su más reciente informe que “el programa ha causado grandes expectativas en las comunidades locales, pero estas expectativas no se corresponden con los recursos y la capacidad del Estado”.
Según el informe, “las brechas entre la entrega de subsidios, la asistencia técnica y la inversión en bienes y servicios públicos han generado descontento en la población, y podría exacerbar el conflicto social. El telón de fondo de esta dinámica es una larga historia de abandono y fracaso al momento de cumplir con los compromisos, lo que ha generado altos niveles de desconfianza hacia el Estado”.
Durante los últimos cinco meses, el ejército y la policía antinarcóticos han llegado a las veredas de Tumaco para arrancar miles de arbustos a punta de picos y palas. Los hombres armados irrumpen en los caseríos y arrasan cosechas enteras en solo minutos. Detrás de ellos los campesinos, resignados, alcanzan a rescatar menos de la mitad de la hoja, que se seca en unas horas de forma inevitable.
Ancízar Artunduaga, otro campesino de 33 aos, nacido también en Caquetá, llegó en 2005 a Tumaco para apostarle a la coca. La cultivó durante más de diez aos en la vereda Puerto Rico, ubicada en la parte baja del río Mira, a un par de horas de camino de El Tandil, donde ocurrió la masacre el 5 de octubre. En algún momento Ancízar se cansó del trabajo en el campo e invirtió dinero en una tienda donde ahora provee químicos y fertilizantes a los vecinos que siguen cultivando la hoja.
La vereda de Puerto Rico está a pocos minutos de Ecuador. La mayoría de las casas son construcciones recientes, siempre hechas de madera y latón. Allí hay tiendas de abarrotes y un colegio, pero a la comunidad le ha costado mantener a los maestros, que dejan de asistir por miedo a la violencia o por lo costoso y difícil que resulta el viaje desde la zona urbana. Mientras tanto, los nios crecen y andan por ahí ociosos o muy ocupados raspando los arbustos de coca hasta esquilmarlos por completo.
En todo Tumaco, donde el desempleo y la desigualdad campean, los hombres jóvenes suelen dedicarse a solo dos oficios: o cultivan la hoja de coca o viajan como mulas para exportar la cocaína hacia México y Estados Unidos. En un solo viaje, pueden recibir hasta 100.000 dólares por el encargo.
Colombia puede mostrar hoy la tasa de homicidios más baja de los últimos veinte aos, con un promedio nacional de 23,6 por cada cien mil habitantes. Pero Tumaco aún supera el 70.
El informe Forensis 2016, elaborado por el Instituto de Medicina Legal, analizó las cifras de homicidios registradas entre 2014 y 2016 en los veinticinco municipios que alojan las zonas veredales donde la antigua guerrilla de las Farc hace su tránsito a la vida civil.
Son lugares tradicionalmente violentos que durante aos han vivido acosados por la guerra, atrapados entre los bandos en pugna. Entre esos veinticinco municipios, los homicidios ligados al conflicto armado han disminuido después del Acuerdo de Paz. Pero las muertes violentas asociadas a otros fenómenos, como enfrentamientos entre bandas y ajustes de cuentas, se han disparado.
Tumaco, así como Tibú —ubicado en el departamento Norte de Santander, cerca de la frontera con Venezuela— y San Vicente del Caguán, en Caquetá, al sur del país, suman el 66 por ciento de los homicidios no ligados al conflicto armado en Colombia. Es decir, muertos que no fueron producidos directamente por la guerra, pero sí como secuelas de ella.
En toda la zona rural de Nario, la guerra de hoy es hija de la paz. La salida de las Farc ha desatado una batalla por el control del territorio y el provecho financiero del narcotráfico. Por muchos aos la guerrilla controló ese negocio. Cuando se fue, estalló la crisis: durante cinco meses, la economía informal alrededor de la coca prácticamente se suspendió porque faltaba un ejército que pusiera orden y gobernara la zona.
Las finanzas se descalabraron, el efectivo desapareció y centenares de familias vivieron del trueque: pasta base a cambio de comida en las tiendas ubicadas entre los caseríos. Hasta que un nuevo grupo, llamado Guerrillas Unidas del Pacífico, tomó el control del territorio y asumió las funciones del grupo desmovilizado.
Las GUP están integradas por antiguos miembros de las Farc que no se acogieron al Acuerdo de Paz. En las primeras horas después de la masacre de El Tandil, sus hombres fueron acusados de las muertes por el Ministerio de Defensa, pero rápidamente uno de los comandantes guerrilleros lo desmintió en un video. En pocas horas, un informe de la Defensoría del Pueblo atribuyó la posible autoría de los disparos a la policía antinarcóticos, que estaba en el lugar reprimiendo una protesta de cocaleros, entre los cuales estaba Faiber.
Ese mismo día, en Puerto Rico, otro contingente de la policía se enfrentó con los campesinos que intentaban proteger sus cultivos. Ancízar estaba junto a sus vecinos en otro cordón humano, cara a cara contra los hombres armados en la trocha de tierra y piedras que comunica al caserío con otras poblaciones y con el río Mira.
“Acá también dispararon, pero al aire. Hubo tres heridos; algunos corrieron y otros nos quedamos. Ya por aquí, después de ver tanta guerra, la gente está acostumbrada a los disparos”, dijo Ancízar.
Aquella maana casi todo el pueblo se había vuelto a reunir para protestar, siempre tratando de salvar los cultivos. Pero la policía logró detenerlos e impedir que avanzaran, mientras el ejército, ubicado a escasos 300 metros, arrancaba arbustos hasta dejar pelada una hectárea de terreno cultivada de coca.
Ancízar dijo esa maana que él y sus compaeros resisten básicamente porque no tienen alternativa. Las autoridades dicen que los cocaleros actúan obligados por las GUP, pero Ancízar rebate esa versión con un argumento sencillo: “Cuando usted depende de la coca para comer y criar a sus hijos, no necesita que nadie lo obligue a defender los cultivos. Lo que estamos defendiendo es la comida de nosotros”.
Las GUP se mantienen en el territorio encargadas de la seguridad, pero en constantes pugnas con otros grupos: el Clan del Golfo, una banda criminal integrada por más de tres mil hombres; y el Ejército de Liberación Nacional, una guerrilla tan antigua como las Farc.
Del lado civil, los cultivos de Tumaco crecen en tierras de propiedad colectiva, controladas casi totalmente por dos gremios: el Consejo Comunitario del Alto Mira y Frontera, integrado por familias de origen afro, habitantes antiguos de esta zona, y la Asociación de Juntas de Acción comunal de los ríos Nulpe y Mataje, Asominuma. Muchos afrocolombianos vendieron parcelas a colonos que llegaron desde otras regiones desplazados por las fumigaciones aéreas que el gobierno realizó en su eterna lucha contra el narcotráfico.
“Cada persona aquí que tiene su hectárea, fue porque se la compró al dueo original. Yo pagué por la tierra que tengo. Y como yo, muchas personas”, dijo Ancízar. Pero el problema de la tierra persiste aquí, pues la propiedad en muchos casos no está del todo clara. Líderes y distintas asociaciones han insistido en que el Estado debe resolver primero el conflicto de la tierra, antes de poder echar a andar un programa de sustitución de cultivos de forma efectiva.
El consejo comunitario y Asominuma suscribieron con el gobierno el acuerdo para dejar la coca y empezar a sembrar plátano, cacao, caa, pimienta y otros. Ambos quieren desprenderse de la coca, porque, según dicen, trae demasiada violencia y escaso dinero para sostener a sus familias. Pero los civiles temen que los dueos del negocio, los narcotraficantes, acaben con ellos por propiciar el fin de su lucro. Las amenazas son ciertas y muchas se han concretado.
Desde la firma del Acuerdo de Paz entre el gobierno de Colombia y las Farc, decenas de líderes sociales y comunitarios han sido asesinados en una campaa que empieza a recordar el exterminio perpetrado en los aos ochenta y noventa contra el partido de izquierda Unión Patriótica. En aquella época, miles de asesinatos y persecuciones fueron perpetrados por paramilitares y cuerpos de seguridad del Estado.
Hoy en Tumaco ese fenómeno está vivo. Y los temores de los líderes locales se han materializado en días recientes, con múltiples amenazas y el homicidio de José Jair Cortés, miembro del consejo comunitario. Cortés, junto a otros líderes afro, participó en una reunión con el vicepresidente scar Naranjo, días después de la masacre de El Tandil y le manifestó el temor que él y sus compaeros tenían ante la violencia creciente que vive la zona. A las pocas horas, el 17 de octubre Cortés fue asesinado en su casa.
Todo este fenómeno ha puesto el ojo sobre la política antidrogas de la administración de Santos. La erradicación forzada propicia los excesos policiales y sus desenlaces violentos.
Hace poco el ministro de la Defensa, Luis Carlos Villegas, anunció que para este mes se alcanzaría la meta de 40.000 hectáreas erradicadas de manera forzosa, pero a esa cifra habría que restar al menos un diez por ciento de resiembra por parte de los campesinos.
La sustitución ofrecida a las familias que viven de la coca luce lejana e improbable. Los desplazados que llegaron a Tumaco desde distintos rincones de Colombia en busca de la bonanza al final solo encontraron la misma miseria de siempre. La Fundación Paz y Reconciliación dice que el caso de Tumaco puede repetirse pronto en al menos diez municipios del país.
La masacre, que sigue bajo investigación, encendió alarmas y generó ruido entre la opinión pública en Bogotá. Pero poco a poco la indignación por las muertes empieza a apagarse, como ha ocurrido en ocasiones anteriores con incontables masacres similares. La sociedad colombiana parece haber hecho un callo, a fuerza de ver repetidas tantas muertes innecesarias. Es solo cuestión de tiempo antes de que otro caso vuelva a despertar la intermitente indignación colectiva.
Aquella tarde, en el porche de su casa, después de sobrevivir a la masacre de El Tandil, Faiber Sabogal recordaba la maana en que se libró de la muerte por muy poco. Como no había ningún hospital cerca, su padre y varios campesinos amigos lo trasladaron herido hasta el pueblo de San Lorenzo, del lado ecuatoriano. Allá llegó junto con otros heridos y le salvaron la vida.
Detrás de su brazo izquierdo, Faiber lucía otra cicatriz antigua. “Esto fue hace aos, en Caquetá, en un combate del ejército con las Farc. Pero esa vez sí me dieron sin culpa”, dijo, y siguió caminando despacio hacia la entrada de su casa. Allí, con un gesto de la mano, pidió a que le trajeran la historia clínica, elaborada durante su estadía en el hospital. “Tengo todos los papeles y estoy hablando con un abogado para meterle una demanda al Estado”, dijo.
La pequea historia de este campesino sirve para dibujar el mapa cruento de Colombia, un país que intenta construir la paz, atrapado todavía en los resabios de una guerra omnipresente. En Caquetá y Nario, con cinco aos de diferencia, Faiber sobrevivió a dos disparos de fusil; algo extremo e improbable, pero nada sorprendente en este país.",0
"US jobs growth was better than expected in November, with payrolls rising by 228,000.
Service, health care and manufacturing firms helped to drive the gains, holding the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%.
Economists had expected an increase of about 200,000 jobs, but early festive season hiring and a rebound after two hurricanes earlier this year helped to boost growth.
The US Labor Department report follows other recent data suggesting that the US economy is in solid shape.
US economic growth has hit an annualised rate of more than 3% in the past two quarters, while the unemployment rate is at its lowest since 2000.
The pace of job growth has slowed this year, but remains higher than the number needed to keep up with population growth.
And as the labour market tightens, the gap between people of different education levels has narrowed, a sign the expansion is reaching people left out of the earlier economic recovery.
The unemployment rate of those at least 25 years old without a high school diploma fell to 5.2% last month, down from 7.9% a year earlier.
That was the lowest rate recorded to date, US Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said.
Manufacturing firms added 31,000 jobs, while health care payrolls increased by 30,000. Even the retail sector, which has struggled this year, saw a gain, adding 18,700 jobs, amid expectations of robust end-of-year shopping.
Economists remain puzzled that wages are not rising more rapidly, given the strong labour market.
Average hourly earnings for private sector workers were $26.55 last month, up about 2.5% from a year earlier, but below forecasts.
The average has been weighed down by the fact that many of the new jobs are roles that offer relatively low pay, such as home health aides, said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at the Charles Schwab  asset management firm.
But she said the decline in the unemployment rate, coupled with steady labour force participation rates, suggested the pool of available workers had shrunk, making pay increases likely in 2018.
""If orders are strong and business is good, I think employers will have to pay more,"" she said. ""I don't think they're going to have much choice.""
Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com, said concerns about sluggish wage growth would not deter the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates again at its meeting next week, pulling rates away from the unusually low levels seen during the financial crisis.
The Fed has already raised rates twice this year. It is widely expected to raise rates at the meeting, increasing the target range for a key borrowing rate up another quarter percentage point, to 1.25%-1.5%.",0
"Since they first entered the White House eight years ago, the Obama’s vacations have cost the taxpayer a huge amount of money. Their last vacation racked up a bill of nearly $8 million for just the travel expenses. To operate Air Force One for an hour it costs $210,000. Their trip to Hawaii and back cost a whopping $7.7 million.
Judicial Watch have added up the cost of all their vacations and this number is $70 million spent just on travel.
Barack has also apparently been pampering his daughters and you won’t believe by how much:
According to Amazon, Obama is spending a total of $75,500 tax dollars PER YEAR to send his daughters to school. That multiplied by the eight years that he has been in office comes to a grand total of $604,000 that we have spent on those girls.
Here’s the full breakdown of tuition at the Sidwell Friends School, which Sasha and Malia have attended since their father took office:
Lower School Aftercare (Optional) 1 to 5 days per week $1500 to $5,775
Most Americans can barely afford to feed their children thanks to Obama’s ridiculous policies, yet we are expected to pay nearly $100,000 a year to send his girls to the fanciest school in the country. That doesn’t seem fair…
This does not even consider security and travel. What are your thoughts on this?",1
"Thousands of people have gathered outside the Scottish Parliament for a rally in support of independence.
A sea of saltires waved as the crowds listened to musical performances and speeches from campaigners.
The rally, organised under the Voice Of The People banner, comes just over a week after Scotland rejected independence in the referendum.
Many of those in attendance were still sporting badges, signs and banners in support of the Yes campaign, which won 45% of the vote on September 18.
They joined in with renditions of Flower Of Scotland and Caledonia, while speakers urged them to carry on with the campaign.
Those addressing the crowd included SNP MSP Marco Biagi and Kate Higgins of the Women For Independence group.
Ms Higgins urged people to reach out to the older female generation who may have voted No, and to take the campaign into deprived communities across Scotland.
“It’s not over,” she told the crowd.
“The dream will never die as long as we have gatherings like this.”
Mr Biagi rallied supporters, stating: “True power has not been given back to Westminster, it has been lent to them and one day we will take it back.”
Those attending were encouraged to give their backing to the SNP, with the party continuing its recruitment drive by making membership forms available at the event.
The SNP – alongside other pro-independence parties – has seen its membership dramatically increase in the wake of the referendum.
Meanwhile, another campaigner called on people to sign a petition calling for a “revote of the Scottish Referendum, counted by impartial international parties”. The petition on change.org has been signed by more than 93,000 people.
A second rally, focusing on the demand for a revote, will be held outside Holyrood tomorrow. More than 9,000 people have stated they plan to attend on the event’s Facebook page.
A third rally, dubbed The 45 Plus Rally, will be held outside the Parliament on November 29, with 32,000 people stating they are going on Facebook.
Other rallies have been organised via social media in various parts of Scotland, including Glasgow and Aberdeen.",1
"A wildfire driven by erratic winds and exceptionally dry conditions continued to rage Monday near Los Angeles, with firefighters likely still days away from getting it under control.
The so-called Sand fire in Angeles National Forest has grown by about 10,000 acres a day since it was first reported Friday afternoon, authorities said.
By Monday evening, it had grown beyond 33,000 acres, with only 10 percent of it contained.
Los Angeles, in its fifth year of a drought, typically doesn't see such combustible conditions for another month.
""They're explosive right now,"" Chief Mike Wakoski, head of the U. S. Forest Service firefighting team heading the effort, said at a news briefing.
About 20,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes as nearly 3,000 firefighting personnel battle the blaze through windswept canyons.
In some parts, there was so much smoke that firefighters could barely see in front of their trucks, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said.
The fire has destroyed 18 buildings so far, with some close calls. One person was found dead inside a burned car Saturday, but investigators haven't yet disclosed the official cause of death.
Among the lost structures was the Sable Ranch, a fabled set used for TV shows dating to the 1960s, including ""The A-Team, ""24"" and ""Motel Hell.""
Manager Derek Hunt told NBC Los Angeles that he was devastated by the loss but was thankful that no lives were lost as the flames roared through on Sunday.
""It came in fast. If you blinked your eye, you would have missed it,"" he said.
Authorities urged residents to prepare to evacuate, saying that in too many instances firefighters have been delayed by helping people who waited too long to get out.
""The fire wants to get up, it wants to run, and it wants to go through 10,000 acres and wants to threaten thousands of homes,"" Los Angeles County Fire Department Deputy Chief John Tripp said.
The fire compromised air quality and dropped ash on parts of Los Angeles over the weekend. As winds shifted, smoke could be seen Sunday in Las Vegas about 270 miles away.",0

"The suspected gunman behind the Las Vegas massacre made several large gambling transactions in recent weeks, according to multiple senior law enforcement officials and a casino executive.
On several occasions, Stephen Paddock gambled more than $10,000 per day — and in some cases more than than $20,000 and $30,000 a day — at Las Vegas casinos, according to an NBC News source who read the suspect's Multiple Currency Transaction Reports (CTR) and a casino gaming executive.
According to a U. S. statute, a CTR is a Treasury- and IRS-mandated report that casinos have to file when ""each transaction in currency involving cash-in and cash-out of more than $10,000 in a gaming day.""
It was not immediately clear whether those transactions were losses or wins.
Paddock's brothers were stunned to learn Monday that their sibling was the suspect in the largest mass shooting in modern U. S. history.
Eric Paddock of Orlando, Florida, said he had ""no idea"" why his 64-year-old brother committed the shooting.
""Mars just fell into the Earth,"" he said. ""We're completely dumbfounded.""
Eric Paddock said his brother was retired and was ""just a guy"" who stayed at hotels, gambled and went to shows.
Their brother Bruce Paddock, who lives in California, said his family grew up in Sun Valley, California. Their father, Benjamin Paddock, was on the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted list in the 1970s for robbing banks and was described as psychopathic in an arrest warrant.
According to the warrant, the suspect's father carried a firearm and was considered ""armed and dangerous."" It listed his nicknames as ""Big Daddy,"" ""Chromedome"" and ""Old Baldy.""
In 1960, The Arizona Republic described Benjamin Paddock as a three-time bank robber who was accused of stealing about $25,000. He was arrested in Las Vegas and ""indicted on three counts of robbing Phoenix branches of the Valley National Bank,"" an archived article said.
The elder Paddock was sentenced to prison in Texas for the robberies.
But six months after his sentencing, he escaped and robbed a bank in San Francisco before being recaptured in Oregon, The Eugene Register-Guard reported in 1978. He had lived in Oregon for several years, evading capture by changing his name and appearance until his arrest, according to the paper.
Bruce, who said he hadn't talked to Stephen in about 10 years, said his brother made money through apartment buildings, which he owned and managed with his mother, who lives in Florida.
""I don't know how he could stoop to this low point, hurting someone else,"" Bruce said.
He added that his brother, who lived in Mesquite, Nevada, about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas, was a laid-back, ""never-in-a-hurry"" type of guy. Bruce said his brother was a law-abiding citizen who never did anything violent prior to the shooting.
Martin J. Kravitz was the lead attorney for Cosmopolitan Hotels when Paddock sued the facility over a slip and fall in 2012.
""He was really kind of bizarre. He dressed slovenly to the deposition,"" Kravitz said. ""He is the kind of personality that's slovenly and careless.""
Kravitz said that Paddock did not seem angry and was not the kind of person who would have stood out.
At least 59 people were killed when Paddock opened fire into a crowd of approximately 22,000 at an outdoor country music festival from the 32nd floor of Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on Sunday night, police said. Police said at least 527 other people were wounded.
The shooting is not believed to be connected to international terrorism, authorities said.
The suspect was a licensed pilot who owned two planes. He also had at times obtained fishing licenses from Alaska.
It is believed he lived in a retirement community in Mesquite.
Public records show that Stephen Paddock lived a relatively transient life, having 27 different residences in California, Texas and Nevada.
From 1985 to 1988, he worked for a predecessor company of Lockheed Martin as an ""internal auditor,"" public records show.
""We're cooperating with authorities to answer questions they may have about Mr. Paddock and his time with the company,"" Lockheed Martin said in a statement.
CORRECTION: (Sept 2, 2017, 7:55 p.m. ET) An earlier version of this article misstated the type of license Stephen Paddock obtained in Alaska. He bought a three-day fishing license once in 2009 and again in 2010, not a hunting license, according to officials with the state's Department of Fish and Game.",0

We have created a world where everything is available to us for the right price – or is it? From top-secret military bases to exclusive clubs, there are several locations that have been restricted from the general population.
Check out these 15 locations that you are NOT allowed to visit.
Located near Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England Royal Air Force (RAF) Menwith Hill is a vast complex, containing a number interesting and unique structures. This site provides communication and intelligence support to both the United Kingdom and the United States. It has been described as the largest electronic monitoring station in the world. Included on the site is an extensive satellite ground station, and it acts as a communications intercept and missile warning site.
Each summer the Bohemian club invites the most influential people in the world to gather at this location for a two-week camp. It is 2,700-acre rural location located in California, although its exact location is unknown.
This is a male only location, sorry ladies!
If you were to gain access to the guestbook you would find presidents such as Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon among their former guests.
Located off the coast of Brazil, Snake Island is a small island that is inhabited by 4,000 of the deadliest snakes on the planet. The risk is so high that the Brazilian Government decided to ban visitors from any access to the island.
Think they are over-reacting? The venom of these snakes is so powerful it has the ability to melt human flesh!
Coca-Cola has spared no expense in their efforts to keep their secret formula safe from prying eyes! This high-tech vault holds the key to their success – a recipe that only a couple people have ever seen.
While the World of Coca-Cola museum in downtown Atlanta will feature exhibits about the secret formula of Coca-Cola, the full recipe will remain locked up safe and sound.
The United States Army Post Fort Knox is located in Kentucky, just south of Louisville. This 109,000-acre base is considered one of the most secure places on the planet. Protected by around 30,000 soldiers and a flotilla of attack helicopters, nothing is getting in or out of this base without it being known!
What are they protecting that is so important? The Fort holds the United States Gold Bullion Reserve as well as countless other national treasures.
Located on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen near Longyearbyen, in the remote Arctic Svalbard archipelago. This secure seed bank was designed to preserve a wide variety of plant seeds that are duplicate samples of those held in gene banks worldwide, to be accessed only in the event of a catastrophic environmental disaster.
Access to the vault is EXTREMELY restricted, not even open to those countries that have provided the seeds stored within. It is managed as agreed upon in a tripartite agreement between the Norwegian government, the Crop Trust and the Nordic Genetic Resource Center.
The Vatican Apostolic Library, formally established in 1475, contains on of the most significant collections of historical texts known to man. This secret library includes everything from ancient Maya codices to books that ‘allegedly’ are proof of alien contact.

Located near the village of Montignac, in the department of Dordogne, southwestern France, the Lascaux Caves contain over 600 ancient cave paintings, estimated around 17,000 years BP. This location was inducted into the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list in 1979.
A strange fugal invasion currently threatens the paintings contained upon these cave walls, with lichens and crystals beginning to appear on the walls in the late 1950’s. Access to the caves was restricted beginning in 1963.
Believed to contain over 3 billion pages of information pertaining to genealogy and family history of Americans, the vault is completely off limits save for tours on very rare occasions.
This vault was constructed into the side of a mountain with careful consideration going into the preservation of the documents it would contain. For this reason it is very carefully temperature controlled.
A secret organization, also often referred to as Bureau 39, Room 39 was established in 1970. The goal of this organization is to find ways to obtain foreign currency for the Chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea, Kim Jong-un.
The data available pertaining to this organization is EXTREMELY limited, however it is believed to have over 20 bank accounts across Switzerland and China for the purposes of money laundering and other illegal operations.
One of the most protected and restricted areas within the boundaries of Russia, Mezhgorye is believed to be a secret nuclear missile site.

"A 200MPH Bentley first owned by Cristiano Ronaldo has been put up for sale on Auto Trader for 65,000 – less than half the price he originally paid.
The superstar footballer forked out around 200,000 for the 2008 Continental GT Speed and was regularly photographed driving it to and from Manchester United’s training ground.
He picked up numerous parking tickets in the high-powered motor after crashing his Ferrari 599 GTB near Manchester Airport.
According to reports, Ronaldo sold the car, along with a 2004 Mercedes C-Class, to a Manchester United fan for 114,995 in August 2009, meaning it has almost halved in value the past seven years.
Croydon dealership A&R carriages has now taken the dark blue motor into stock.
Their managing director, Anthony D’silva, had been looking for a Bentley to use in this summer’s Modball Rally, a 2500 mile drive across Europe.
The luxury coupe has been driven just 36,500 miles in eight years and has a full Bentley service history.
Unlike other footballer-owned vehicles, little has been done in terms of personalisation.
It boasts a 6-litre W12 engine, 600bhp, a 0-60 time of 4.3 seconds and a top speed of 202 mph. However, the car guzzles fuel and manages just 17mpg.
Anthony said: “I am big football and Ronaldo fan so when I found out it was his I had to buy it.
“The car is in great condition, it is a really clean example which has a full Bentley service history and the great talking point that it was first owned by Cristiano Ronaldo, who is arguably the world’s best footballer.
“It is a great investment opportunity for a collector, sports fan or just someone who is simply after a well cared for Bentley GT Speed.”",1
"The university in northern England has been fined 400,000 for endangering the lives of two students, by giving them 100 times the recommended dosage of caffeine, the equivalent of drinking 300 cups of coffee in one go.
An ill-placed decimal point on a mobile phone being used to calculate the caffeine dosage led to the sports science students at Northumbria University being given 30g of caffeine instead of 0.3g. Death can occur at 18g, the court was told.
The students, both in their twenties, were taking part in an experiment to measure the effect of caffeine on exercise. In past experiments, caffeine was administered through tablets but the university has since switched to powder of a much higher concentrate.
Northumbria University has apologised after two students took a potentially fatal amount of caffeine in an experiment #CapitalReports pic.twitter.com/bZABQUnMQm
“No one, including the lab technicians or senior lecturer, checked to ensure the dosage had been correctly calculated,” prosecutor Adam Ferrer said. They immediately suffered side effects, including dizziness, blurred vision, shaking and a rapid heartbeat, resulting in them being admitted to intensive care for several days where they underwent dialysis.
“If they had not been admitted to intensive care immediately for treatment, they could have died from a caffeine overdose,” Ferrer said. Both men suffered weight loss, had their training regimes affected and one of the men reported short-term memory loss following the overdose.
The judge said their good physical shape helped their bodies cope with the potentially lethal dose. Both men have since returned to their studies at the university.",1
"A baby girl in Guinea, who was the last known Ebola patient in a two-year West African epidemic, has recovered, health officials say.
The recovery of the baby, named Nubia, means the last country still battling the virus can begin its 42-day countdown to declaring an end to outbreak. Neighboring Sierra Leone was declared Ebola-free on Nov. 7.
""We did two tests that turned up negative. She is completely cured of Ebola,"" said Fodé Tass Sylla, spokesman for Guinea's Ebola coordination unit.
Nubia was born on Oct. 27 in the Nongo Ebola treatment center to an infected mother who did not survive. Nubia received treatment from medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders or MSF).
""We are pleased that she has been tested negative, but as she is the first infected baby to have recovered, she will continue to receive specialized medical support before going back home,"" said Laurence Sailly, MSF's emergency coordinator in Guinea.
Sixty-eight people who had been in contact with the country's last cluster of patients and were deemed at risk of Ebola infection were released from quarantine on Saturday.
The epidemic, the worst known Ebola outbreak in history, began in Guinea's forest region nearly two years ago. More than 28,000 people were infected and more than 11,000 of them died, nearly all of them in West African neighbors Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.",0
"Firefighters have stopped the spread of a series of wildfires that have been burning mostly in Sonoma County for more than a week, but the number of deaths in the blazes has risen to 42, and 50 people are still considered missing, officials said.
""We have a lot of work to do still. We have a lot of hot areas on these fires, but we have stopped the forward progress and movement of all these fires. We have line around them,"" Bret Gouvea, incident commander for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said at a news conference Wednesday.
Twenty-three people have been confirmed dead in the fires in Sonoma County, which started on Oct. 8 and 9, Sheriff Rob Giordano said. About 250 volunteers are doing targeted and blanket searches to find 50 people who remain missing, he said.
""We're searching every place that burned for a victim we may have missed,"" Giordano said. He said that he toured the area by air and that ""I could not believe how much burn damage, and how many houses are burned.""
Firefighters are ""doing a great job. They're shutting this down,"" Giordano said. ""But it's not going to go away — we're going to be dealing with this for months and years in the county.""
Eight people have been confirmed dead in Mendocino County, seven have been reported dead in Napa County and four have been killed in Yuba County, officials have said. One of the dead was the driver of a private water tender assigned to the the Tubbs Fire in Sonoma County, who was killed in a vehicle rollover.

Firefighters were battling 13 large fires on Wednesday across California that have burned more than 210,000 acres, according to Cal Fire. More than 22,000 people remained out of their homes across the state vecause of fires, according to the agency.
More than 5,800 homes and other structures have been destroyed in Mendocino, Sonoma and Napa counties. Most of the structures were destroyed in the Central LNU fire, which is burning mostly in Sonoma County but also in Napa County, according to Cal Fire.

Gouvea said Wednesday that the Pocket Fire, which has burned more than 12,000 acres, was 63 percent contained; the Tubbs Fire, which has burned more than 36,000 acres, was 91 percent contained; and the Nuns Fire, which was burned more than 54,000 acres, was 80 percent contained.
In Napa and Solano counties, the Atlas Fire has burned more than 51,000 acres and was 83 percent contained, according to Cal Fire.
Over the last 24 hours, more than 6,000 people have been allowed to return to homes that had been threatened by the three fires burning mostly in Sonoma County, and so far the department has repopulated more than 42,000 people to over 17,700 homes that were not destroyed, Gouvea said.

"Facebook accounts with apparent Russian ties purchased about $150,000 in political ads aimed at American voters during key periods of the 2016 presidential campaign, according to a new analysis released Wednesday by the social networking company.
The internal Facebook findings – which it said in a blog post it had already turned over to U. S. authorities – comes as the Silicon Valley giant faces intense scrutiny from special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees concerned about how both real internet trolls and fake news bots preyed on U.S. voters during last year’s election.
Facebook found some $100,000 in ad spending from June 2015 through May 2017 connected to about 470 accounts that were deemed as inauthentic and in violation of its internal guidelines. These accounts – associated with about 3,000 ads – were connected to each other “and likely operated out of Russia,” Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, wrote in a Wednesday blog post.
While the “vast majority” of those ads didn’t reference any specific presidential candidate, or even the election itself, Stamos explained that the Russian ads that Facebook uncovered were designed to amplify hot-button social and political issues, such as LGBT rights, race, immigration and gun rights.
A quarter of the Russian-linked ads were also geographically targeted at specific Facebook audiences in the U. S., and most of them ran in 2015 before the first primaries and caucuses when the GOP and Democratic presidential fields were still packed with multiple candidates. While the amount of spending on the ads was nominal at best, the fact that it even occurred is likely to reinforce concerns expressed by some Democrats that Russia may have used Facebook to promote narratives that flattered Trump and bashed Clinton in key Rust Belt swing states that helped the real estate mogul take the White House.
“This is no longer supposition,” said Andrew Bleeker, the president of Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic digital advertising firm that worked for Clinton in 2016.
On Capitol Hill, California Rep. Adam Schiff – the top Democrat in the House’s Russia probe – reacted to the Facebook analysis to note he’s trying to get an Intelligence Committee hearing on “the use of social media by Russia during the campaign.” He said there’s been no agreement yet about which witnesses would be called.
Separately, Facebook also found another $50,000 in political ad spending – for about 2,200 ads – that were bought from accounts “that might have originated in Russia,” Stamos wrote.
Stamos explained that Facebook cast a wide net looking for accounts “with very weak signals of a connection and not associated with any known organized effort.” It also was looking for ads bought from accounts with U. S. internet protocol addresses but with the language setting dialed in to Russian.
The overall spending figure for the Russian-linked ads – at about $150,000 – is a relatively small amount compared to the overall digital ad buy made during the course of the 2016 campaign. While firm spending totals are difficult to assess because of loose federal election reporting requirements, media reports in the aftermath of last year’s presidential race have cited $55 million in spending from one of Hillary Clinton’s primary digital firms, and $90 million spent on Donald Trump’s side through his main digital adviser, Brad Parscale.
Facebook has been under the microscope for months to explain how its platform was exploited during the last presidential campaign. That race remains under investigation for potential collusion between Trump’s team and a Russian government that U. S. intelligence agencies stated earlier this year had a “clear preference” for the Republican.
In May, Oxford Internet Institute professor Philip Howard and colleague Robert Gorwa co-authored an op-ed in the Washington Post urging lawmakers to force Facebook’s hand and produce any underlying metadata about questionable social media accounts that may have played a role in the election outcome.
“If there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian influence operations, Facebook may be able to spot that too,” the researchers wrote. “In many ways, massive coordinated propaganda campaigns are just another form of election interference. If Facebook has data on this, it needs to share it.”
Facebook has undertaken its own internal review of how it tracked and handled activity on its site during the presidential election, including the spread of fake news. New policies include limits on news feeds that share stories with consistent clickbait headlines and blocks on pages that repeatedly share fake news stories to advertise. The company also removed 30,000 fake accounts before the French elections in April and tens of thousands of accounts before the United Kingdom’s snap election in June.",0
"The U. S. Air Force and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Successfully launched a third flight test of the newly upgraded B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb.
The USAF announced on Tuesday that the test showed the nation’s “continued commitment to security.”
While the announcement comes against the backdrop of the weekend’s terror attacks in Paris, the test itself was actually conducted on October 20 at Tonopah Test Range, according to officials at the NNSA and USAF. The test was used to assess the weapon’s non-nuclear components, but the bomb itself contained no highly enriched uranium or plutonium.
“This demonstration of effective end-to-end system performance under representative delivery conditions marks another 2015 achievement in the development of the B61-12 Life Extension Program,” NNSA Deputy Administrator Madelyn Creedon said, calling the flight test “evidence” of “[our] commitment to our nation’s security and that of our allies and partners.”
During the test, an F-15E took from Nellis Air Force Base in southern Nevada released the B61-12 bomb and demonstrated it in “a realistic guided flight environment,” the joint NNSA and USAF announcement said. Initial reports were that everything went as planned, and that the telemetry, tracking, and video data were all collected without issue.
‘A lot of money to spend on an obsolete weapon’
The hardware featured in the flight test was co-designed by the Sandia National and Los Alamos National Laboratories, manufactured by the National Security Enterprise Plants, and attached to a tail-kit assembly designed by Boeing. While the tail-kit assembly guided the test unit, the NNSA and USAF noted that the actual nuclear weapons will not be guided by GPS.",1
"Donald Trump says one of the first things he'll do when he becomes president is deport up to 3million undocumented immigrants. It would be one of the largest such roundups in American history.
Here are answers to many questions about how he will accomplish that.
How many ""criminal"" undocumented immigrants are there?
In a post-election interviewwith CBS' 60 Minutes, Trump said he would deport2 million to 3 million of the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are ""criminal and have criminal records.""The actual number depends on how one defines ""criminal.""
The Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank, estimates 820,000 undocumented immigrantshave been convicted of a crime in the United States. About 300,000 were convicted of feloniesand 390,000 of serious misdemeanors.
The Department of Homeland Security puts the number of ""removable criminal aliens"" at 1.9 million, but that estimate includes foreigners with legal status, people convicted of all crimes (except fortraffic offenses) and those repeatedly caught crossing the border.
Many are already in custody, making them the easiest to identify. The Congressional Research Service estimates more than 142,000 non-citizenswere in federal and state prisons and local jails in 2013,the last year for which data is available.The service could not determine how many were undocumented.
How will the government track down those undocumented immigrants?
Trump could ask Congress for more funding to increase the size of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), buta quicker solution would beredirecting the current 14,000 ICE officers, agents and special agents to concentrate on arrests.
But only 1,000-1,100 agents currently trackdown fugitive undocumented immigrants who are criminals or gang members, according to John Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE. The rest work on detention operations, screening visa applicants in foreign countries, conducting immigration audits of U. S. businessesand investigating crimes that include money laundering, import and export fraud, and human trafficking.
Sandweg said several core functions must be maintained because of congressional mandates, but an ICE director could easily refocus more people to finding undocumented immigrants.
""There would be a lot of flexibility for an ICE director to re-calibrate the agency,"" said Sandweg, now an attorney with Frontier Solutions.
How quickly can undocumented immigrants be deported?
Before they can be deported to their home country, immigrants have the right to a hearing before an immigration judge. But the nation's immigration courts are already overburdened.
That has led to a huge backlog of521,676 cases waiting nearly two years on average to be heard, according to theTransactional Records Access Clearinghouseat Syracuse University. Cases take an average of 675 days to complete, with some states like Colorado averaging more than 1,000 days per case.
The only way to speed up those cases is to hire more immigration judges. There are currently 273, according to the Justice Department. Congress has approved funding to increase the number to 374, and Trump could ask Congress to hire even more.
Yet, even if Trump filled all 374 posts and added 150 more judges over the next two years, they could not clear out all the currently pending immigration cases until 2023, according toa review by Human Rights First, a non-profit advocacy group.
Which undocumented immigrants will be targeted?
Trump's emphasis on criminals may leave millions of other undocumented immigrants in the clear.
One such group: the 740,000 young undocumented immigrantsgranted deportation protections under President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. To qualify, they had to register with the federal government, have a clean record and workor goto school.
Trump has vowed to end the program and rescind their deportation protections, leaving them fearful of being targeted.
Mexican nationals would be the most heavily targeted, because they account for 52% of undocumented immigrants, according to the Pew Research Center. Another 15% come from Central America, 13% are from Asia, and 6% come from South America.
Deported Mexicans are usually sent home by bus, while those from other countries are put on flights.
What will happen to those who remain?
As a candidate, Trump often hinted that some undocumented immigrants could remain in the U. S.During the 60 Minutes interview, he said that after the border is secured, his border wall is completed and ""everything gets normalized,"" he would ""make a determination"" on how to handle those whoremain.
Trump has not elaborated, but Republican proposals in recent years provide some possibilities.
In 2014, after the Senate passed a bill that allowed some undocumented immigrants to become U. S. citizens, House Republicans outlined a plan that instead would let themreceive legal status, but not citizenship.
Immigration advocacy groups decried the House proposal as ""second-class citizenship,"" but some Republicans endorsed that idea as a way to punish undocumented immigrants for entering illegally but still allow them to live in the U. S. without fear of deportation.",0
"On 26 April 1986, the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident occurs at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in the Soviet Union. Thirty-two people died and dozens more suffered radiation burns in the opening days of the crisis, but only after Swedish authorities reported the fallout did Soviet authorities reluctantly admit that an accident had occurred.
The Chernobyl station was situated at the settlement of Pripyat, about 65 miles north of Kiev in the Ukraine. Built in the late 1970s on the banks of the Pripyat River, Chernobyl had four reactors, each capable of producing 1,000 megawatts of electric power. On the evening of 25 April 1986, a group of engineers began an electrical-engineering experiment on the Number 4 reactor. The engineers, who had little knowledge of reactor physics, wanted to see if the reactor’s turbine could run emergency water pumps on inertial power.
As part of their poorly designed experiment, the engineers disconnected the reactor’s emergency safety systems and its power-regulating system. Next, they compounded this recklessness with a series of mistakes: They ran the reactor at a power level so low that the reaction became unstable, and then removed too many of the reactor’s control rods in an attempt to power it up again. The reactor’s output rose to more than 200 megawatts but was proving increasingly difficult to control. Nevertheless, at 1:23 a.m. on 26 April, the engineers continued with their experiment and shut down the turbine engine to see if its inertial spinning would power the reactor’s water pumps. In fact, it did not adequately power the water pumps, and without cooling water the power level in the reactor surged.
To prevent meltdown, the operators reinserted all the 200-some control rods into the reactor at once. The control rods were meant to reduce the reaction but had a design flaw: graphite tips. So, before the control rod’s five metres of absorbent material could penetrate the core, 200 graphite tips simultaneously entered, thus facilitating the reaction and causing an explosion that blew off the heavy steel and concrete lid of the reactor. It was not a nuclear explosion, as nuclear power plants are incapable of producing such a reaction, but it was chemical, driven by the ignition of gases and steam that were generated by the runaway reaction. In the explosion and ensuing fire, more than 50 tonnes of radioactive material were released into the atmosphere, where it was carried by air currents across the surrounding areas.
On 27 April, Soviet authorities began an evacuation of the 30,000 inhabitants of Pripyat. A cover-up was attempted, but on 28 April Swedish radiation monitoring stations, more than 800 miles to the northwest of Chernobyl, reported radiation levels 40% higher than normal. Later that day, the Soviet news agency acknowledged that a major nuclear accident had occurred at Chernobyl.
In the opening days of the crisis, 32 people died at Chernobyl and dozens more suffered radiation burns. The radiation that escaped into the atmosphere, which was several times that produced by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was spread by the wind over Northern and Eastern Europe, contaminating millions of acres of forest and farmland. An estimated 5,000 Soviet citizens eventually died from cancer and other radiation-induced illnesses caused by their exposure to the Chernobyl radiation, and millions more had their health adversely affected. In 2000, the last working reactors at Chernobyl were shut down and the plant was officially closed.",1

Kevin Sloan, a U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service project manager for the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge, stands on a proposed site for a new recreation beach on Assateague Island. (Ian Shapira/The Washington Post)      — Less than 200 miles from the nation’s capital, in a place so remote that ponies run wild, the tug of the tide is rivaled only by the pull of the federal government.  Commercial shellfish farmers still inhabit the waters of the adjacent Assateague Island National Seashore, harvesting millions of clams and oysters annually before shipping them off to wholesalers and restaurants. And vacationers still bask in the tranquillity of Assateague Island’s beach, home to panoramic sunset views, a forest full of warblers and horned owls, and — perhaps most important — up to 1,000 parking spots right by the shoreline. But now two powerful federal agencies want to change — or, obliterate, depending on which “Teaguer” is talking — the delicate arrangement. The National Park Service wants to wind down commercial fishing in Assateague’s waters for an unspecified period that could be, in the agency’s words, “as long as a generation.” And the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to relocate Assateague’s popular-yet-eroding beach to higher ground about 1miles north, depriving swimmers of gorgeous views of the Atlantic Ocean and, to the west, Tom’s Cove.   [Assateague Island, one of the places most vulnerable to climate change]  Jack Tarr, Chincoteague Island’s mayor for the past 17 years, said both proposals are frustrating many of the 4,000 residents of the town, which swells to 15,000 people during the summer. He worries that the beach’s move north on Assateague Island could turn off summer vacationers, and that the closing of commercial fishing, even if it takes place 20 or so years from now, could eradicate a key part of the area’s heritage and economic prowess.  “We don’t even understand why they want to end fishing. We’re not creating harm to anyone. Oysters actually clean up the water,” Tarr said. “And the major problem with the beach proposal is that we don’t know if we’ll have the same beach experience. It’s spread out and really nice right now.” Since the pre-Civil War days, commercial oyster and shellfish fishermen have been allowed to operate in the waters around Assateague Island, where all the land is now federally owned. But Debbie Darden, the National Park Service’s superintendent of the Assateague Island National Seashore, said the federal government considers this type of farming “agricultural,” making it prohibited in any national park, unless Congress grants special approval. In an interview, Darden acknowledged that the National Park Service has never enforced the policy but wants to now. “Basically we’re just trying to bring everyone into compliance with the federal law. The National Park Service is set up to preserve the environment and keep it unimpaired for future generations,” Darden said. “It’ll probably take a generation or longer to do that. We don’t want anyone making a living off these activities to be harmed.”  [New clues in search for a wild pony missing from Chincoteague]  Asked by The Washington Post to specify how oyster and clam fishing might damage the environment, Darden said the agency is still trying to make those assessments. “We don’t have a lot of specific information about what’s happening in our park waters.” The soonest the commercial fishing ban could be approved would be by the fall of 2016, and even then, it wouldn’t take effect for decades.    Tommy Clark, owner of Tom's Cove Aquafarms, rides his fiberglass skiff out into Tom's Cove next to Assateague Island. He is surveying his water and checking in on his oyster and clam farmers. (Ian Shapira/The Washington Post)  That’s little solace to Tommy Clark, 58, owner of Tom’s Cove Aquafarms, which sells millions of oysters and clams every year to wholesalers such as Sysco and restaurants including Grand Central Oyster Bar in New York City. Clark, who launched his business in the early 1980s, employs more than a dozen farmers who grow oysters and clams in a hatchery and then plant and tend to them in the Assateague waters.  Even though the proposed ban wouldn’t take effect for some time, Clark says the mere prospect saps the value of his business if he did ever want to sell it. Who’d want to buy a business that would be considered illegal in the future? “Most business people here, they don’t have big retirement and padded IRA accounts. They have a business and that’s their retirement,” Clark said. “So, if the government passes the ordinance, they’d wipe the whole thing out.” Out on the water last week, Clark motored his fiberglass skiff out into Tom’s Cove, where he met up with oyster farmers dressed in waders, tending their crop. He emphasized that he doesn’t dredge for wild oysters, which could be harmful to the seafloor. “These aren’t public oysters, they’re private oysters. We’re not taking anything from the water that wasn’t ours,” Clark said, as he met up with another company’s farmers, Jacob Lucas, 24, and Brad Micholson, 25, cleaning out mud and other sediment from oyster bags buried on the bottomland.  The men, mystified by the National Park Service’s proposed ban, emphasized how oysters remove oxygen-sucking algae and nitrogen pollution. They noted that oysters are being used to prevent pollution in Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay.  [Maryland’s gigantic new oyster reef could save the Chesapeake Bay]  “This is helping the water,” Lucas said.  “We don’t use chemicals, no antibiotics. It’s all natural,” Clark said.  Clark is so invested in the oyster business that he owns his own eatery, Don’s Seafood Restaurant on Main Street, home to the end product of his food operation: $13 for a dozen of his oysters. (By contrast, a dozen oysters at Old Ebbitt Grill in Washington costs $30.) The other draw to Chincoteague isn’t just the seafood. It’s the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge on Assateague Island, the adjacent one-mile recreational beach and the 961-space parking lot built on clay and crushed seashells. The fragile barrier island attracts 1.3million visitors a year, many drawn by its famous herd of wild ponies, memorialized in the children’s book “Misty of Chincoteague.” But Kevin Sloan, the refuge’s project leader, said storms, high tides and northeast winds constantly flood and erode the beach and parking lot, which are on the most dynamic, southernmost part of Assateague Island. The influx of water moves that section of Assateague Island westward, forcing the National Park Service to frequently rebuild or repair the beach’s parking lot at considerable taxpayer expense. He says that a new beach about a mile and a half north of the current location would be built on more stable ground, wouldn’t be as vulnerable to high seas, and therefore wouldn’t require the multiple, costly repairs. “We respect the fact the recreational beach is largely the driver of the economy, and we want to preserve that, but to preserve it, we need to move the beach because that provides a more resilient location,” Sloan said. “Now, when a storm comes and takes the beach out, there’s always several days when the beach is closed.” The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could approve the new beach plan as soon as mid-October, Sloan said. For David Johnson, 72, a Chincoteague Island resident for the past five years, the original beach carries memories, and he wants it to stay put. He remembers visiting the beach in 1978 on his honeymoon. He and his wife liked the area so much they bought a Chincoteague home about a decade ago and moved there permanently about five years ago. If it costs too much money to constantly move and fix the beach parking lot, Johnson offered up a solution: “They could raise the park admissions fee,” he said.    She’s 10. She has HIV.

"That desirable beachfront bungalowin Malibu, luxe high-rise condo in New York or historic brownstone in Washington, D. C., might soon come with fewer tax perks.
Americans that borrow large sums of money to live in pricey real estate markets and states with high property taxes like California and New York will reap fewer tax benefits from home ownership under a tax proposal rolled out Thursday by House Republicans.
Under the proposed plan, the tax code in general would be less friendly for many Americans who own or want to buy real estate. The plan would cap the deduction for property taxes, which is currently unlimited,at $10,000. The proposal would also keep the current mortgage interest deduction of up to $1 million only on existing mortgages, but cap the deduction at $500,000 for new purchases.
""Those in the luxe category will be hit the hardest,"" says Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Trulia, the online real estate site. It will also impact expensive coastal markets like California, Washington state, New York, Massachusetts and cities in Florida like Miami Beach.
""It will be a double whammy for people in those markets,"" he says, because homeowners therewon't be able to reduce their tax bill as much due to smaller allowed deductions forinterest paid on big mortgages and high property taxes.

More: Tax plan offered by Republicans meets some GOP resistance
Expensive cities like San Jose, Calif., where nearly 95% of the homes are valued over $500,000, and San Francisco, with more than 80% of homes priced higher than half a million dollars, according to Zillow, are the ones likely to be affected most.
If there'sa silver lining to the proposed changes, which the realtor community says nullifysome of the incentives of owning a home, it is that a swath of Americans won't likely be hit.
As part of the tax overhaul, the government is roughly doubling the standard deduction — or the amount of incometaxpayers can shield from taxation. Forindividual filers it would be $12,000, and for married couples it would be $24,000.
As a result, fewer American homeowners —many living in moderatelypriced homes in states with low property taxes —will opt to not itemizedeductions on their tax returns anyhow, which by itself waters down the effect on most people.
Currently, about 30% of Americans have a large enough mortgage or pay enough in property taxes to take advantage of the housing-related tax shelters on their returns.
What's more, just 11.1% of homes nationwide purchased with a 10% down payment now, according to Trulia data,would result in a mortgage of $500,000 or more, and exceedthe Republican's proposed cap on interest deductions.
In short, the changes related to real estate are seen hitting the higher-end of the market most, says Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt, a tax-prepartion service. ""I don't know many low-income, hard-working middle-class Americans that borrow $500,000.""
Still, the homebuilder and realtor community sees the proposed changes as a threat.
Jerry Howard, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, says there are now 7 million homes in the U. S., that if sold after a 10% downpayment, would top the $500,000 interest deduction cap. His firm also notes that 3.7 million households paid more than $10,000 in property taxes in 2016.
""The bottom line is we believe this proposal is putting us at risk of another housing recession,"" Howard told USA TODAY, adding that his group would continue to negotiate for a better deal.
One fear is that existing homeowners —especially in high-priced and high-taxed markets — will opt to stay in their current homes, rather than sell and be subject to less favorable tax treatment.
William Brown, president of the National Association of Realtors, which represents 1.3 million realtors, says the bill ""represents a tax increase on middle-class homeowners.""
Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow, the online real estate site, says the new rules could actually level the playing field, as the old ones designed to subsidize home ownership ended up favoring the wealthy most.
Whether the proposed tax rules laid out Thursday would become law is toughto handicap, she adds, although she senses ""at least a willingness"" politically to try pushing through the changes.",0
"FIVE men who ran a bookshop in Hong Kong disappeared in mysterious circumstances in late 2015. One was apparently spirited away from the territory by agents from the mainland; another was abducted from Thailand. All later turned up in Chinese jails, accused of selling salacious works about the country’s leaders. One bookseller had a British passport and another a Swedish one but the two suffered the same disregard for legal process as Chinese citizens who anger the regime. Their embassies were denied access for weeks. The government considered both these men as intrinsically “Chinese”. This is indicative of a far broader attitude. China lays claim not just to booksellers in Hong Kong but, to a degree, an entire diaspora.
China’s foreign minister declared that Lee Bo, the British passport-holder, was “first and foremost a Chinese citizen”. The government may have reckoned that his “home-return permit”, issued to permanent residents of Hong Kong, trumped his foreign papers. Since the territory returned to mainland rule in 1997, China considers that Hong Kongers of Chinese descent are its nationals. Gui Minhai, the Swede taken from Thailand, said on Chinese television, in what was probably a forced confession: “I truly feel that I am Chinese.”
China felt it could act this way because it does not accept dual nationality. The law is ambiguous, however. It stipulates first that a person taking a foreign passport “automatically” loses their Chinese nationality and then, contradictorily, that an individual has to “renounce” their nationality (hand in their household-registration documents and passport) and that the renunciation must be approved. According to Mr Gui’s daughter, he went through the process of relinquishing his citizenship. Yet the Chinese authorities considered that his foreign passport was superseded by birth and ethnicity: both Mr Gui and Mr Lee are Han, the ethnic group that makes up 92% of mainland China’s population.
Ethnicity is central to China’s national identity. It is the Han, 1.2bn of them in mainland China alone, that most people refer to as “Chinese”, rather than the country’s minorities, numbering 110m people. Ethnicity and nationality have become almost interchangeable for China’s Han, says James Leibold of La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia. That conflation is of fundamental importance. It defines the relations between the Han and other ethnic groups. By narrowing its legal labour market almost entirely to people of Han descent, ethnicity is shaping the country’s economy and development. And it strains foreign relations, too. Even ethnic Han whose families left for other countries generations ago are often regarded as part of a coherent national group, both by China’s government and people.
The Han take their label from the dynasty of that name in the third century BC. Yet the people labelled Han today are a construct of the early 20th century, says Frank Diktter of the University of Hong Kong. For well over half of the past 650 years, the bulk of territory now called China was occupied by foreign powers (by Mongols from the north, then Manchus from the north-east). Chinese history paints the (foreign) Manchus who ran China’s last dynasty, the Qing, as “Sinicised”, yet recent research suggests that they kept their own language and culture, and that Qing China was part of a larger, multi-ethnic empire.
Under Western imperialism race was often used to divide people. But after the Qing fell in 1911, the new elite sought to create an overarching rationale for the Chinese nation state—its subjects spoke mutually incomprehensible languages and had diverse traditions and beliefs. Patrilineage was already strong in much of China: clans believed they could trace their line to a group of common ancestors. That helped Chinese nationalists develop the idea that all Han were descended from Huangdi, the “Yellow Emperor”, 5,000 years ago.
Race became a central organising principle in Republican China. Sun Yat-sen, who founded the Kuomintang, China’s nationalist party, and is widely seen as a “father” of the Chinese nation, promoted the idea of “common blood”. A century on President Xi Jinping continues to do so. One reason for his claim that Taiwan is part of China is that “blood is thicker than water”. In a speech in 2014 he set his sights even wider: “Generations of overseas Chinese never forget their home country, their origins or the blood of the Chinese nation flowing in their veins.”
Many Chinese today share the idea that a Chinese person is instantly recognisable—and that an ethnic Han must, in essence, be one of them. A young child in Beijing will openly point at someone with white or black skin and declare them a foreigner (or “person from outside country”, to translate literally). Foreign-born Han living in China are routinely told that their Mandarin should be better (in contrast to non-Han, who are praised even if they only mangle an occasional pleasantry).
China today is extraordinarily homogenous. It sustains that by remaining almost entirely closed to new entrants except by birth. Unless someone is the child of a Chinese national, no matter how long they live there, how much money they make or tax they pay, it is virtually impossible to become a citizen. Someone who marries a Chinese person can theoretically gain citizenship; in practice few do. As a result, the most populous nation on Earth has only 1,448 naturalised Chinese in total, according to the 2010 census.Even Japan, better known for hostility to immigration, naturalises around 10,000 new citizens each year; in America the figure is some 700,000 (see chart).
The conflation of Han and national identity underlies the uneasy relationship between that majority and China’s ethnic-minority citizens. Officialdom theoretically treats minorities as equal and even grants them certain privileges. Yet in practice ethnic groups, particularly those from China’s borderlands, who are visually distinctive, are discriminated against and increasingly marginalised as ethnic Han have moved into their home regions. Through state-sponsored resettlement the Han population of Xinjiang rose from 4% in 1949 to 42% today; Mongols now make up only 17% of Inner Mongolia (see map).
At best non-Han groups within China are patronised as “charming and colourful” curiosities. Yunnan province has built a thriving tourist industry around its minority cultures. Minorities are routinely presented as delighting in folkish customs in contrast with the technologically superior Han. In an exhibition of “Xinjiang’s nationalities” in a museum in Urumqi, the provincial capital, the only person in modern clothes is Han; signs note that Chinese Uzbeks “have a special liking for all kinds of little caps” and Chinese Kazakh life is “full of songs and rhythms”.
China risks turning cultural insensitivity into ethnic clashes. Ordinary manifestations of local culture in border regions have been criminalised. In Xinjiang, Uighur men may not grow long beards and Muslims are sometimes prevented from fasting during Ramadan. Inner Mongolian and Tibetan nomads have been forcibly settled. In Tibet and Xinjiang, many schools teach mostly in Mandarin, even if they lack enough Mandarin-speakers.
That legitimises prejudice in daily life. “They think of us as wild, as savage” says a Tibetan guide in Xining, the Han-dominated capital of Qinghai province on the Tibetan plateau; only one of his Han neighbours even says hello to him. Tibetans and Uighurs are routinely rejected from hotels elsewhere in China (Chinese ID cards state ethnicity). Reza Hasmath of the University of Alberta found that minority employees in Beijing were typically better educated but paid less than Han counterparts. The best jobs in minority areas go to Hans.
Chinese are now organising in small ways to fight for labour rights, gay rights and environmental concerns but there is little indication that Han are gathering to defend their ethnic peers—perhaps unsurprisingly, given that to do so could be seen as supporting separatism. If anything, the opposite is true: the government’s rhetoric, particularly on the dangers of Islam, has exacerbated existing divisions.
Hui Muslims have long been the successful face of Chinese multiculturalism: they are better integrated into Han culture and widely dispersed (importantly they speak Mandarin and often look less distinct). Yet Islamophobia is rising, particularly online; social-media posts call for Hui Muslims to “go back to the Middle East”. In July, Mr Xi used a trip to Ningxia province, the Hui heartland, to warn Chinese Muslims to resist “illegal religious infiltration activities” and “carry forward the patriotic tradition”, a sign that he views this group with suspicion, as well as those on China’s fringe with a history of separatism.
Although many of China’s citizens are not treated as equals, Han Chinese with foreign passports are welcomed and accorded a special status. Anyone with Chinese ancestry has legal advantages in getting a work visa; foreign-born children of Chinese nationals get a leg-up in applying to universities.
This attitude has helped the Chinese economy. Over the past decade much of the inward investment has come from overseas Chinese. Many second-generation Chinese-Americans have started up firms in China. Yet being a member of the “Chinese family”, as Mr Xi puts it, carries expectations too. At a reception in San Francisco last December for American families who had adopted Chinese children, China’s consul reminded them that “you are Chinese”, citing their “black eyes, black hair and dark skin”; he encouraged them to develop a “Chinese spirit”.
In the eyes of the Chinese government, these responsibilities extend beyond cultural ties to a demand for loyalty, not just to China but to the Communist Party. Many foreign Han say they are made to feel it is their duty to speak up on China’s behalf. Earlier this year Chinese immigrants to Australia were urged to take “the correct attitude” to support “the motherland” in its claims to disputed rocks in the South China Sea. A former Australian ambassador to China recently wrote that China’s sway in the country extends to “surveillance, direction and at times coercion” of Chinese students and attempts to enlist Australian Han businessmen to causes serving China’s interests. Chinese-language media in Australia, which was almost universally critical of China in the early 1990s, is mostly positive today and eschews sensitive topics such as Tibet and Falun Gong.
China struggles to accept that descendants of Chinese emigrants may feel no obligation to reflect China’s interests. Gary Locke, the first Chinese-American ambassador to Beijing in 2011-14, was repeatedly criticised by state media for doing his job—representing American interests, even if they conflicted with China’s. Foreign Han journalists in China report accusations of disloyalty by the Public Security Bureau and reminders of their “Chinese blood”.
There is a strong ethnic component to China’s tense relationship with Hong Kong (which it rules) and Taiwan (which it claims). Each is dominated by Han, but increasingly they prize a local rather than “Chinese” identity. A poll by the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that 9% of respondents identified themselves solely as “Chinese”, down from 32% in 1997, when the territory returned to Chinese rule; the trend is similar in Taiwan.
The Chinese government even risks clashing with foreign governments by claiming some form of jurisdiction over their ethnic-Han citizens. Last year the government of Malaysia (where the Han population is 25%) censured the Chinese ambassador when he declared that China “would not sit idly by” if its “national interests” and the “interests of Chinese citizens” were violated. The threat he saw was a potentially violent pro-Malay rally, planned in an area where almost all traders were Han but few were Chinese nationals. In isolated cases it goes further. The arrest and detention of naturalised American citizens born in China has long been an irritant in relations between the countries.
China’s Han-centred worldview extends to refugees. In a series of conflicts since 2009 between ethnic militias and government forces in Myanmar the Chinese government has consistently done more to help the thousands escaping into China from Kokang in Myanmar, where 90% of the population is Han, than it has to aid those leaving Kachin, who are not Han. Non-Chinese seem just as beguiled by the purity of Han China as the government in Beijing. Governments and NGOs never suggest that China take refugees from trouble spots elsewhere in the world. The only large influx China has accepted since 1949 were also Han: some 300,000 Vietnamese fled across the border in 1978-79, fearing persecution for being “Chinese”. China has almost completely closed its doors to any others. Aside from the group from Vietnam, China has only 583 refugees on its books. The country has more billionaires.
China’s iron immigration and refugee policy attracts little attention probably because few have sought to immigrate. Victor Ochoa from Venezuela describes himself as “red-diaper baby”, the child of foreign experts who went to China in the 1960s to help build a Socialist Utopia. He studied architecture in Beijing and has remained in China. Yet he has had to apply for a work visa annually for 40 years to stay; now he wants to retire, he has no means to stay: “I’ve built hospitals here, now I just want to sit in my apartment and read. But I am not allowed,” he laments.
Many outsiders see China as a land of opportunity. Some seek to settle. Yet the government is becoming more draconian towards such groups. Tens of thousands of Chinese men have undocumented marriages with women from Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos, often of the same (non-Han) ethnic group. After years of officialdom turning a blind eye, many of these women are now being sent back and their ID cards confiscated. Guangzhou’s government has launched a three-year plan to tackle illegal immigration. It named no target but may have its eye on up to 500,000 Africans, many of them overstaying their visas, in part of Guangzhou known by locals as “Chocolate City”.
Decades ago China’s government might have argued that the country was too populous or too poor to accept new entrants. Now Chinese women have fewer than 1.6 children on average, well below the replacement rate, and in 2012 the working-age population shrunk for the first time. Yet China is already succumbing to problems many countries face as they grow richer and their workforce better educated. It has a severe shortage of social workers, care staff and nurses, jobs that most Chinese are unwilling to fill. That deficit will grow over the next decade as China’s population ages. Most rich countries attract immigrants to perform such roles, yet in September China’s government reiterated that visas for unskilled or service-industry workers would be “strictly limited”.
A closed China wilfully narrows its access to the global pool of professional talent. The government grants surprisingly few work visas. Foreigners made up 0.05% of the population in 2010, according to the World Bank, compared with 13% in America. A “green card” scheme was launched over a decade ago to attract overseas talent but only around 8,000 people qualified for one before 2013, the latest date for which figures exist. Many of these were former citizens with overseas passports, says Wang Huiyao of the Centre for China and Globalisation, a think-tank in Beijing.
At the same time its own citizens are heading overseas. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese leave every year to study or work abroad. Many have returned to China to work and are a driving force of innovation and high-tech development. Far more do not come back: of the 4m Chinese who have left to study abroad since 1978, half have not returned, according to the Ministry of Education. Yet because China bans dual nationality those who become eligible for a foreign passport, by birth, wealth or residency, face a choice. The result is that the brain-drain is mostly one-way. Thousands of Chinese renounce their citizenship every year, but because it is so difficult for foreigners to become Chinese, no counterbalancing group opts in.
China’s Han-centred worldview is not just a historical curiosity. It is a decisive force in the way it wields its growing power in the world—a state that respects neither equality nor civil liberties at home and may ignore them abroad too. In economic terms, China will cut itself off from an important source of economic growth, waste resources in discriminating against ethnic minorities and fail to use its human talent to better effect. Exacerbating ethnic tensions may spur the separatism it fears. And by sorting citizens abroad by their ethnic identity rather than their national one—whether by claiming to defend “its own” or punish them for disloyalty—China risks clashing with other countries. Over the past century, China’s founding myth has been a source of strength. But as it looks forwards, China risks being borne back ceaselessly into its own past.",0
"LOS ANGELES — Consumers turned out in droves over the weekend to buy Apple's most expensive iPhone ever, the iPhone X, and in less than three days, it was as good as sold out.
In a spot check of availability for the new iPhone Monday, USA TODAY could only find units available for same day retail pickup in Tacoma and Spokane, Washington. An earlier check, on Sunday, found it sold out in 20 big cities.
Consumer enthusiasm vanquished any doubts that Apple would be able to persuade buyers to spend$999 on up for the state-of-the-art phone, its most expensive yet, though it suggested a supply bottleneck — related to specialized components of the phone — could temper sales.
According to Apple's website,the new phone, which starts at $999, was unavailable for pickup in the following: New York, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Dallas, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, San Antonio, Houston, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Diego, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Washington, DC, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina.
Delivery times for online orders were 3-4 weeks, according to Apple. An Apple representative didn't respond to a request for comment.
The iPhone X went on sale Friday at 8 a.m., and started selling out by Saturday afternoon. Long lines returned to the Apple Stores from eager consumers hoping to buy one, something Apple didn't see with the release of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus in September.
""Lines were stronger than we have seen in years across Apple stores and rivaled iPhone 6 first day build up,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst with GBH Tech Research. The last of the great fan lines at Apple Stores was for 2014's iPhone 6.
Many consumers on the line were buying two each, either to re-sell or to give as gifts. Ads for iPhone X units at inflated resale prices from $1,500 to $5,000 began appearing on secondary markets like eBay and Craigslist over the weekend.

More: Want the iPhone X? It doesn’t have to cost you $1,000
Gene Munster, an investor and analyst with Loup Ventures, said these were the longest lines since 2014's iPhone 6 release. The iPhone 6 was the last time Apple introduced a re-designed and re-imagined phone, as it did with the iPhone X.
""The iPhone X line counts exceeded lines for the previous 3 iPhone releases, including lines 57% longer than the iPhone 7 lines,"" Munster wrote in a blog post.
The iPhone featured an edge-to-edge OLED screen, promising richer and stronger colors, the ability to unlock the phone with facial recognition and produce animated emojis based on your facial expressions.
It was expected to go quickly. The company is using several new parts that haven't been used before in mass production, causing the hiccup.
The iPhone X initially was available as a pre-order on October 27th, but the initial shipment for November 3 delivery sold out within minutes, and many customers were promised deliveries of anywhere from 3 to 5 weeks. However, Talking Tech's order was cited as November 10th to 17th, but then arrived early, on Friday.
New iPhones from Apple have traditionally sold out by late Sunday on opening weekend, with the exception of the 8 and 7.",0

The notorious German con artist Benjamin Holt is apparently on his way back to Thailand even though he was banned for scamming generous Thais out of over $1000.
Suffering from a congenital ailment called macrodystrophia lipomatosa which leaves him with a swollen left leg, Holst previously used his condition to beg for money on the streets of Bangkok and Pattaya.
Claiming he also lost his passport and pocket money, Holst earned the sympathy of a local German foundation and was given money amounting to 50,000 Thai baht for his board and plane ticket home.
Instead of using the money properly, however, Holst disappeared from Bangkok and later showed up in Pattaya where he wasted the money on bar girls and booze.
Aside from the photographic evidence, local drivers said Holst gave them pocket money and instructed them to fetch him prostitutes and alcohol.
A fellow German who still lives in Thailand named Alfred Hoeld and who brags often about also spending money on Thai prostitutes, suggests on Benjamin’s facebook that he should fly to Laos and then sneak across the border and enter Thailand illegally.

"Mark Ciavarella Jr. a longtime Democratic judge from Scranton, Pennsylvania, wassentenced to 28 years in jail for participating in a major juvenile justice bribery crime known as the “kids-for-cash” case.
Michael Conahan, Ciavarella’s partner in crime, was also accused of participating in the bribery incident.
The judge received more than $2 million inpayoffmoney from a contractor who was constructing two juvenile detention centers and for extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars from the detention center’s co-owner. The Supreme Court in the state went on to toss out 4,000 convictions issued by Ciavarella from 2003 to 2008.
The 61-year-old judge of Pennsylvania was charged with racketeering at the beginning of this fiscal year. Ciavarella’s lawyer has entreated for a more “reasonable” sentence as the judge has already been through a lot.
“The media attention to this matter has exceeded coverage given to many and almost all capital murders, and despite protestation, he will forever be unjustly branded as the ‘Kids for Cash’ judge,” read their sentencing message.
Ciavarella denied any allegations following his apprehension, claiming that all payments he received were legal, denying that he locked up young children in exchange for money.
During a trial of the case in February, the jury came to a mixed decision, charging Ciavarella on twelve accounts, and exonerating him of 27 counts, extortion included. The verdicts that found him guilty are linked to a payment of $997,600 from the constructor of the facility.
In the meantime, Conahan, the second judge included in the case, pleaded guilty last year and his sentence is pending.
The 4,000 cases that were dismissed by the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania speak volumes about the gravity of this crime. Well, Ciavarella has the next 28 years to think about what he had done. Hopefully, it would be enough.

"It has been exactly four years since the Stratolaunch has started its building, and now the largest plane on Earth is finally to be presented. It is designed by the Stratolaunch Systems, its wingspan is wider than a football field and it is created to bear rockets into the stratosphere.
In numbers, its wingspan is 385 feet, it weighs about 500,000 pounds and can carry 550,000 pounds more. For the record, the largest plane that has ever flown is Howard Hughes’ Spruce Goose with a wingspan of 319.
The aircraft has 28 wheels and it is constructed in the Mojave desert inside a hangar. It runs on six Boeing 747 engines and is preparing for its first test flight, as reported by Jean Floyd the CEO of Stratolaunch Systems.
“Over the coming weeks and months, we’ll be actively conducting ground and flightline testing at the Mojave Air and Space Port,” it was written on the company’s website. “This is a first-of-its-kind aircraft, so we’re going to be diligent throughout testing and continue to prioritize the safety of our pilots, crew and staff. Stratolaunch is on track to perform its first launch demonstration as early as 2019.”
The company was founded and started by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in a race to be the leading company for aircraft that can launch objects into orbit. Recognizing the accomplishment, Floyd added that they will continue to work and the company will have more to say.
“We have a lot of exciting activity ahead as we enter the testing process, and we look forward to sharing our progress during the coming months,” Floyd added.

"A huge asteroid capable of worldwide devastation will visit earth thisChristmas, giving the planet a wide berth.
According to astronomers a massive piece of rock will safely whizz past during the holiday season. They announced on Thursday that we will be safely visited by a celestial body capable of inflictingglobalenvironmental change.
Scientists assumethat the ‘Christmas Eve’ asteroid is not an ‘Earth-grazer’ due to its relative distance from someone standing on the earth.
The massive space rock, about two kilometres (1.2 miles) in length, will cruise by our planet about 28 times farther than the distance between Earth and the Moon, Mark Bailey, director of the Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland, told AFP.
“It’s not what you would call an Earth-grazer or anything like that,” he said — contradicting media reports that it could pass near enough to trigger earthquakes and volcanoes.
“It’s at a distance such that you could expect several such encounters with objects of that sort of size every year — so maybe every couple of months you would get one coming that close, and of the same size.”
Here are delay-Doppler images of 2003 SD220 as observed by us at @NAICobservatory these past few nights. pic.twitter.com/iOMXOIiOBy
The asteroid, dubbed 163899 or 2003 SD220, will pass at a distance of some 11 million kilometres.
The year 2015 had already seen several flit by much closer than that.
The objects that truly concern astronomers, are those that get closer to Earth than the Moon — out there at a distance of more than 300,000 km.
Once every 100,000 years does it happen that a space rock larger than a kilometre collides with our planet, said Bailey.
“Asteroids of that size are interesting — it’s about the kilometre or half-kilometre size range that, it doesn’t matter where on Earth it hits, has a globally devastating impact on the environment.”
Maria-Antonietta Barucci, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory, affirmed the asteroid was “not on our list of dangerous objects”.
“We can all be calm, relaxed, and enjoy Christmas,” she said.
The next truly “close encounter” will be with the asteroid Apophis, a few hundred metres wide, which is expected to shave past Earth at about a tenth of the Earth-Moon distance on April 13, 2029, said Bailey.
Apophis will be visible with the naked eye as a faint moving point of light in the sky, but again, won’t risk colliding with Earth.
“Apophis is a really unusual encounter, approaching the Earth around 400 times closer than 163899,” said Bailey.

"SAN FERNANDO, Calif. — May was supposed to be dead by now. The charcoal-and-white pit bull mix had languished for more than two months at a high-kill animal shelter in east Los Angeles County, and though she’d passed one “temperament test” required for adoption, she failed a second. That essentially put her on death row at the facility.
But a small rescue group got to May first and reserved her a spot on a school bus that would take her 840 miles north to Eugene, Ore.; there, another rescue had pledged to find her a home. And so on a sunny Saturday morning, she bounded up the steps of the red bus and quickly settled into a large crate near the back.
She had plenty of company as the wheels rolled along the highway: 105 other dogs and cats collected from crowded shelters in Californiaand destined for the Pacific Northwest, where euthanasia rates are lower and pets are in greater demand. Their four rows of crates were stacked floor to ceiling. “These little souls have engulfed me,” admitted Phil Broussard, the garrulous trucker driving them up the coast.
His passengers were among the more than 10,000 animals that will be ferried out of the area this year by Rescue Express, one of the dozens of organizations across the nation fueling a dizzying daily reshuffle of dogs and cats by car, van, bus, and private and even chartered plane.
These transports, mostly from high-kill southern regions, are small but growing factors in a long-term decline in euthanasia at U. S. shelters. According to some estimates, animal shelters killed as many as 20 million cats and dogs annually in the 1970s. That had fallen to 2.6 million by 2011 and to 1.5 million today, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
The numbers are only approximations, because no central data collection exists and only some states require shelters to report intake and outcome figures. But animal advocates agree that the decrease in euthanasia has been dramatic, driven mostly by successful spay-neuter programs and, more recently, by savvy adoption campaigns, greater efforts to reunite lost pets with owners and the proliferation of advocacy groups both small and large that have swept in to help municipal shelters, often poorly funded and sluggish.
“This has been the single biggest success for the animal protection movement,” said Hal Herzog, a psychology professor at Western Carolina University who has long studied human-animal relationships. “It’s been an incredible drop.”
[What’s a ‘no-kill’ animal shelter? The answer is more complicated than it seems.]
Still, hundreds of thousands of animals are euthanized each year, and advocates face challenges to pushing rates lower. For one, pit bull-type dogs — often perceived as dangerous and prohibited by landlords — disproportionately populate shelters. And feline sterilization continues to lag, one reason cats make up nearly 60 percent of shelter animals killed, according to the ASPCA.
Progress remains geographically lopsided, too. Advocates point to northern cities’ more concerted spay-neuter campaigns and mention “cultural” differences in attitudes about sterilizing pets. Climate is another factor: In warmer regions, cats go into heat more often, pets are more likely to be allowed outside, and strays more easily survive — all of which lead to more kittens and puppies.
Whatever the reason, shelters and rescue groups say an increasing number of communities in northern parts of the country now take in migrants —young and old, small and large. Nearly a third of the 30,000 dogs and cats received by a Portland, Ore., coalition of six shelters in 2016 came from outside the area, including from Hawaii.
“For a family that’s looking for that solid dog that’s good with kids and other animals … those are really tough to find,” said Anika Moje, manager of the Animal Shelter Alliance of Portland, which had a 95 percent “live-release” rate in 2016.
This overground pet railroad existed on a small scale for years, then rapidly expanded in the eastern United States after Hurricane Katrina leftthousands of animals homeless in 2005. Transports more recently have mushroomed in the West, despite concerns in some places about what remains a fairly unregulated practice.
[Being labeled a pit bull can doom a shelter dog’s chances of adoption]
Yet even those who devote their lives to these efforts concede they will not end euthanasia of healthy animals.
“We’re the Band-Aid,” said Ric Browde, a board member of Wings of Rescue in Southern California. The group flies thousands of animals a year in its private plane and, sometimes, a chartered jet that can cost $20,000 a flight. “It’s sort of Einstein’s definition of insanity, repeating things over and over and expecting a different result. I can take dogs out of a shelter every day, but if it fills back up, have I done anything?”
The key is keeping the facilities from filling in the first place, says the ASPCA, which in 2014 pledged $25 million to help do this in the Los Angeles area. One of the public shelters it targeted was Baldwin Park, where May was housed for several weeks; it euthanizes 44 percent of the animals ittakes in. On a recent Wednesday, ASPCA staff there counseled people who came to surrender dogs or cats, pointing them toward discounted veterinary care and sterilization services —expenses that often cause individuals to give up their pets.
The following Saturday, volunteer Jana Savage brought May to board the Rescue Express bus. May was a dog the volunteers at Baldwin Park were “worried about,” said Savage, a writer who has helped there for several years. They all felt the county’s temperament test had not given her a fair shake.
Onto the bus went May, along with a miniature pinscher, a yellow puppy and several other small pooches. Broussard had driven the vehicle down the night before from the Rescue Express base in Eugene. The longtime trucker runs many of the organization’s weekly transports, which begin in San Fernando and usually end near the Washington-Canada border.
[Does America have enough dogs for all the people who want one?]
The nonprofit has moved more than 8,000 animals since a former accounting software entrepreneur, a millionaire named Mike McCarthy, founded it two years ago. He’d always had a passion for animals and had donated to several related causes, and after watching a California friend transfer dogs north, he decided there was “a real need for better-quality transports.”
So McCarthy moved to Eugene — a midpoint on the West Coast — to start his own, one that would be free for the small rescue groups he’d seen were often bleeding cash. He opted to retrofit school buses, which he determined were more durable than the vans favored by many transports, could hold more crates and were cheaper to run than planes. Nowadays, that cost is about $20 to $30 per animal, and Rescue Express, with a three-bus fleet, is set to add a route up Interstate 15 through Utah.
McCarthy, 57, wants to take the model nationwide, though he knows it would make only a small dent in a big problem. “It makes a difference to the animals that are on the bus,” he said. “That’s how I look at it.”
From San Fernando to the Canada border, the journey takes more than 20 hours and involves a driver swap. Broussard pulled onto the highwayat 8:35 a.m. Riding shotgun was Laura Miller, a Target manager who moonlights as a Rescue Express “transport supervisor” — a job that entails checking all the animals in and out, plus keeping their crates clean and water bowls filled.
The animals, separated from the cab by a metal partition, were quiet save for one yippy dog named Brownie. As he drove, Broussard held forth on the local geography and national politics. Miller kept tabs on the air conditioning in the back and texted with contacts at the next stop.
At a public shelter in Bakersfield, a few dozen more animals were loaded, including a litter of 6-week-old kittens bound for a rescue group outside of Portland. Then it was back to the highway.
At 12:30 p.m., at a truck-stop parking lot in Fresno, a group of volunteers helped put about 50 dogs and cats on board. Two dogs got on in Turlock, then four more in Lathrop. By 3:15 p.m., the bus was carrying 84 dogs and 22 cats. By 7:30 p.m., the snow-capped Mount Shasta signaled that Oregon was not far off. Miller held up her cellphone and took photos of the sunset.
It was raining and chilly when the bus pulled over in Roseburg, Ore., where an adopter was waiting to greet his new puppy. After midnight, Broussard turned into a gas station lot outside Eugene. Some 15 people, standing under hoods and umbrellas, lined up in the dark to retrieve two dozen animals.
The second-to-last was May, who was whisked away to a streetlight, where she promptly relieved herself.
Today, May is hanging out at Northwest Dog Project, the rescue that had agreed to find her a home. Its 22-acre facility usually hosts 10 to 18 dogs at a time in cottages with piped-in music and even skylights. There’s a doggy swimming pool, an agility course, a play yard and hiking trails.
“A majority of the dogs we take in come from high-kill shelters in California, where they’ve been living in noise and chaos. This is a good place for them to decompress,” director Emma Scott explained.
Like all the animals the organization accepts, 2-year-old May will spend a few weeks being evaluated and trained. Scott said she has been extremely friendly and “adores people.” She “already knew how to sit, and now we’re working on her leash manners. … We’ll do everything we can to make her as adoptable as we can.”

"Photos of Starbucks' Unicorn Frappuccino were everywhere you looked on socialmedia. And if you weren't Facebooking, Instagramming or tweeting about the bright pink and purple drink, you were listening to people talk about it, because they'd seen it somewhere.
And that was just in the past few weeks.
Fast food chains are going gaga on social media to promote products that they hope will go viral. Likes, tweets and engagements translate into millions of dollars in sales, as online influencers post their way to packing more firepower than Super Bowl commercials, and companies pitch menu items that create enough buzz to prompt mentions in Fortune 500 companies' earnings calls alongside (yawn)consolidated operating income.
""Asyoulookat different restaurants, there’s a pattern of introducingnew products that surprise and delight consumers and in a world where surprise and delight (rules) social, it has to be somethingbusiness thinks about,"" saidJanoCabrera, spokesman for McDonald’s, the company that invented not one new utensil, but two. A special straw – called theS. T.R.A.W., which stands for Suction Tube for Reverse Axial Withdrawal -- was designed for the chain's limited-time Shamrock Shakes.
A successful new product only captures consumers’ interest and gets them talking about it, Cabrera said. The TKO punch is when the company does something with it “that supercharges the conversation even further.""
It worked with the Frork. According to the social data analytics companyTalkwalker,which tracks online chatter, McDonald's had 69,000 social- media mentions the day before the french fry fork was introduced versus 123,000 the day of the reveal.
""If they see a spike in social media mentions and a spike in sales, it’s safe to say there was a direct correlation,"" said Talkwalker CEO Todd Grossman.""These are highly sophisticated marketers and advertisers and this is their living. This is their livelihood. This is their job. They’re not going to be right all the time, but they have to experiment.""
Gone are the days of chains' extolling the deliciousness of their foods. Promotional materials highlight the exciting shtick and the limited time the food is available: Get this now... and bring your smartphone.
Because of photos' role in social media strategy, the look of the food is key. The animal unicorn is are usually depicted as dull white, not DayGlo. And is the chicken actually nude? No, it's breaded. But add a sexy word and you get a social bang.
The Unicorn Frappuccino will likely be a case study taught in business schools for years to come. Talkwalker found thatStarbucks had close to 51,000 social-media mentions the day before the sweet-to-sour drink was announced, compared to almost 72,000 the day it was unveiled -- and more than 177,000 the day after that when it was available in stores.
The chain declined to discussdetails about its marketing or product developmentstrategies, but the Seattle-based behemoth has a playbook that works. It creates pumpkin spice lattefrenzies in the fall and its red holiday cups are a pop of attention-grabbing and brand-promoting color on social platforms annually.
""How we use social media is very much an extension of what we call the Starbucks experience,"" saidspokeswoman Erin Shane Riley.
Taco Bell's Naked Chicken chips were inspired by the success of the Naked Chicken Chalupa this winter. For that product, Taco Bell teamed with the website Foodbeastand invited 70-plus ""influencers"" – food bloggers and Instagram foodie stars, like Jen Balisi and Michel Phiphak, who have 314,000 and 192,000 followers on Instagram, respectively, toevents in different cities. These selected few sampled the menu item before it launched and some spread the word to theirfans.
""The photographs of the Naked Chalupaspread like wildfire. We saw a tremendous amount of engagement,"" said Rob Poetsch, Taco Bell’s director ofcommunications and engagement. ""When we launched it in restaurants. we didn't have any advertising support yet. Sales were incredibly high the first several days of our launch. It pretty much exceeded our forecast.... It was alldriven byword of mouth, social and PR.""
The chainsold more than 25 million of those Chalupas in five weeks.That’s an estimated $75 million in sales.Taco Bell declined to comment on the cost of a traditional advertising campaign.
And even if a wacky new menu item’s viral success doesn’t get all the would-be customers to order it, all the buzz gets people in the door to buy other food and drinks.
""All restaurants are somewhat in a bind, right now and they’re trying to differentiate themselves. Thequick-servicerestaurant space, in particular, has been challenged,"" said restaurant consultant JohnGordon of the Pacific Management Consulting Group. ""All the franchise brands have a duty to be able to connectwith their customers somehow, because there are so many competitors of the same basic food type and experiencetype.""
These chains want people Instagramming themselves with the New Media nouveau cuisine – and those people usually are the much-coveted Millennials in their 20's and 30's. They've got decades ahead of them to buy food and an unquenchable thirst for social media. Some even have disposable income.
Compare allthat to the more staid approach Arby's has. When asked about its social media presence, spokesman Chris Fuller cited the chain's tweet to singer Pharrell about his hat, which resembles the chain's logo. But that was more than three years ago.
""Our approach is very niche,"" he said. ""We're very careful. Hashtags can be overdone. It can come across as corporate-y. We want to engagepeople in their space.""
On social platforms,Arby’s engages gamers and self-described nerds. Its strategy is to celebratecommon interests rather than attempta hard sell, according to Fuller.
But social media promotion isn't going away. The switch in how advertising dollars are being spent is seismic, as a growing part of the budget is headed to social.
""Digital is cheaperthan big TV and it is much more efficient than a run-of-press ad or a coupon,"" Gordon the analyst, said.",0
"The American Dream is becoming more like a desert mirage for some first-time home buyers, getting farther away the more they grasp for it.
Home prices are shooting up at more than twice the pace of average earnings growth, rising 5.9 percent vs 2.5 percent, according to the newly released Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It represents the largest increase since July 2014.
Even though the National Association of Realtors has seen an uptick in millennial buyers this year, the low housing supply means competition is fierce, especially in hot markets.
Matthew Massee, a 25-year-old online marketing professional, and his wife moved to Salt Lake City, Utah for the lower cost of living — but still find that housing prices are rising faster than their own salaries.
""We both come from middle-class backgrounds, are college educated, and have jobs,"" he told NBC News. ""In the future we want to buy a house, especially because we want children, but the outrageous prices demanded by the current market mean we will likely never be able to afford a house.""
""You go to look at houses on Saturday, and on Sunday you get an email from the realtor that they have 10 offers lined up so get your best offer in on Monday at 9 a.m.,"" said Jill Freshwater, a 34-year-old researcher and mother in Dallas, Texas. Ultimately she and her family had to increase what they were willing to pay by $60,000. And now that they've bought a house, their property values have gone up by $100,000 in the past year.
The forces of rising prices and stagnating wages are converging on household budgets even as the nation is returning to ""full employment,"" loosely defined as the point at which everyone who wants a job has one.
""It certainly means that families are going to have a harder time making ends meet,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a DC-based nonpartisan think tank. ""We see a relatively slow growth in wages compared to faster rising expenses; we see that in homes, healthcare, childcare, many of the necessary expenses families pay.""
But some bankers say that the real problem is that some first-time home buyers have stars in their eyes when they should be counting their pennies. Millennials are known for their frugality and their determination to put money aside — but not everyone does.
""Some people save and some people don't. They frivol their money away on avocado toast at brunch every week or on expensive car leases,"" said Joseph Allen, vice president and senior mortgage lending officer at Quontic Bank, in New York City, which makes home loans nationwide. (His comments echoed those made by real estate mogul Tim Gurner who recently drew international social media fame and ire after telling 60 Minutes when he was buying his first home he was working hard, not buying smashed avocado on multi-grain toast for $17 a pop.)
Allen recommends buyers set their expectations lower for their first homes and consider a fixer-upper or something outside their desired neighborhood.
""The guidelines are very black and white. There's no pushing the envelope. Either you fit the bill or you don't,"" he said.

That bill has gotten harder to fit for current generations.
For the sake of a comparison, consider that under a classic rule of thumb, you shouldn't spend more than 28 percent of your income on housing costs. (Though millions do).
The median price of a new home in 1970 was about $24,000, according to BLS data. So to afford it under the old-school rule, you only needed to make $6,720 a year — just a hair above the median income at the time, about $6,000.
Adjusted for inflation, that house that would cost $144,000 and you would only need to make $40,000 a year in order to be able to safely afford it.
According to the latest available comparable data, in 2015 the median price of a new home was about $300,000. To afford that, you would have to be making $84,000. That's well above the median income of $55,775.
So you'd need to do more than just skip the avocado toast to bridge that stagnating wage gap.
For Anne Hawkins, a 28-year-old marketing professional from New Hampshire who is struggling to buy a home with her boyfriend, the American Dream means something different than it did 50 years ago.
They both make around $50,000 a year but are having trouble putting together a down payment after their savings were depleted by a bout of unemployment and graduate school costs.
""I have never wanted to be a homemaker, so the idea of living the June Cleaver dream sounds more like a nightmare to me,"" Hawkins told NBC News.
One way they're making the idea of owning a home more affordable is considering that it might not need an extra bedroom for children.
""For myself and my peers, I think the dream is less about ticking off these boxes of material things, and more about finding a fulfilling career and building a life around that,"" said Hawkins, which ""is less likely to include kids than ever before.""",0
"Following the freshest breaking news that John McCain’s McCain Institute for International Leadership was receiving money from anti-American filthy rich George Soros, the institute’s administrators are not willing to reveal a list of its donors now.
One investigation conducted by Daily Caller disclosed that McCain’s “legacy” foundation is filled with Soros’ money, with not even pointing out the money from an extensive list of anti-American agents.
Daily Caller lets the readers know that McCain was the master mind behind the McCain-Feingold act that was dedicated to “reform” campaign finance regulations.
And still, his “institute” is denying to disclose who is donating to its agenda. However, the McCain Institute — founded in 2012 with an $8.7 million in donation that were a residue from McCain’s failed 2008 presidential campaign — denied on Monday to reveal the sums it gotten from its most major donors who gave $100,000 or beyond.
The Institute mentioned that it has a list of donors attached on its website. However Daily Caller also revealed that the sum donated is not mentioned whatsoever. But, the McCain Institute refused to reveal precisely how much cash every major donor gave.
The website only mentions donors who have given “$100,000 and above,” which can be confusing. The Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, for example, is mentioned for contributing $100,000 or more on the Institute’s website. In fact, the Saudis contributed $1 million.
More so, McCain stationed his Institute at Arizona State University for the sole purpose of hiding contributions. As a matter of fact, the bulk of McCain’s donors are foreigners. Out of the 37 donors who gave $100,000 or more to the McCain Institute, one in three is native to a foreign country and analogically to foreign rules and principles.
Additionally, McCain is the honorary convener of the McCain Institute’s signature spring meeting that happens yearly-the Sedona Forum. The Sedona Forum is a “high level, private gathering” held at the fancy Enchantment Resort in Sedona, Ariz.
What are your thoughts on this? What kind of consequences should McCain face?",1

"Thai authorities said Tuesday they have seized 21 unusually large rhinoceros horns worth almost $5 million that were smuggled from Ethiopia.
The bags carrying the horns were discovered last Friday in a random customs search at Bangkok's main airport, the Thai Customs Department said in a statement. They discovered the horns, weighing almost 50 kilograms (110 pounds), inside hard-shelled luggage bags originating from Addis Ababa.

The bags' owners, two Thai women who had arrived on separate flights but went to claim the luggage, fled as officers searched their bags and have not been apprehended, the statement said. Arrest warrants have been issued for them.
Customs officials said the horns are unusually large and pristine.
""Therhinohorns we confiscated this time are the most beautiful horns we've ever seized from this airport,"" the statement said.
It's the second time in two years thatrhinohorns have been seized at the airport, with the previous haul being worth around $600,000.
Rhinoceros horns, blood, skin and urine are in high demand across Asia for their use in traditional Chinese medicine. Demand for the products has soared in Asia, particularly Vietnam, where they are considered a luxury item, according to the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC.
""These horns are huge, which means they came from bigrhinos,"" said Somkiat Soontornpitakkool, director of the division in charge of protecting wildlife at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.
The World Wildlife Fund says very fewrhinossurvive outside national parks and reserves, and some species are endangered. Experts who examined the smuggled horns concluded that the poachers who obtained them must have killed therhinos. It's possible to cut off a rhinoceros' horn without killing it, but the dehorning process poses risks to their health.",0
"McDonald’s have confirmed that they are closing 500 further chains around the world amid a a staggering drop in sales at the fast-food giant.
McDonald’s spokeswoman Becca Hary confirmed the closures just days after the company withdrew its branches from the Middle East and three Latin American countries.
“It’s important to note that while we will have a net reduction in restaurants [in the US], the impact is minimal in comparison to the 14,000 restaurants we operate across the US. We consistently review our restaurant portfolio and make strategic decisions to better position our business for the future,” Hary told The Street.
In 2015, McDonald’s closed 700 under-performing restaurants primarily in Japan, the US and China – 350 more than it had planned – due to a significant decline in global sales. McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook had informed the Wall Street Journal last year that drastic changes were required to be implemented in order to improve McDonald’s financial struggles and its suffering reputation.
“I think there is a hunger and an interest in our business to embrace change. McDonald’s management team is keenly focused on acting more quickly to better address today’s consumer needs, expectations and the competitive marketplace.”
McDonald’s shares have risen 24% during Easterbrook’s 15-month-plus tenure during which he dismissed corporate employees, adjusted kitchen operations, and executed his biggest move – all-day breakfast in the United States. McDonald’s ended 2015 with 36,525 restaurants globally, up about 267 from 2014.
In 2016, McDonald’s has pegged its capital expenditures at $2 billion, with half allocated to reinvestment in its best locations and the other half to open about 1,000 new restaurants. According to Reuters, McDonald’s has received more than half a dozen bids for its China and Hong Kong stores in an auction that could fetch up to $3 billion.
Nonetheless, the fact is McDonald’s has been struggling. The Washington Post reports:
Each time McDonald’s has announced how much money it’s making, the company has been forced to share an embarrassing truth: Americans are eating less and less of its hamburgers, chicken nuggets and French fries.The routine became so consistently depressing that McDonald’s decided to quit sharing monthly performance data altogetherin March.",1
"It’s not your imagination: the New York Police Department has been planing evidence and framing innocent people all in order to meet arrest quotes.
This comes as an a former New York City narcotics detective, Stephen Anderson, testified in court that the NYPD routinely plants drugs on innocent people. He described this as a “common practice,” a “quick and easy” way for officers to reach arrest quotas.
The practice is known among NYPD cops as “flaking.”
Anderson was busted, along with four other officers, “flaking” four men in Queens back in 2008. He has cooperated with prosecutors, and is admitting that far from a few “bad apples,” this is the modus operandi of the NYPD.
“It was something I was seeing a lot of, whether it was from supervisors or undercovers and even investigators,” Anderson testified.
“It’s almost like you have no emotion with it, that they attach the bodies to it, they’re going to be out of jail tomorrow anyway; nothing is going to happen to them anyway.”

The Federal Emergency Management Agency must make public the names of people who sold property through a flood mitigation program and will be required to disclose the exact locations and sales prices of those properties, a federal judge ruled this week. National Public Radio reporter Robert Benincasa sought the data about the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program under the Freedom of Information Act back in 2014, but FEMA refused, saying release of the data would intrude on the privacy of those who sold the property.NPR filed suit earlier this year, prompting U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell to issue her ruling Tuesday that the location and seller information should be in the public domain.“The ‘undeniable and powerful…’ public interest in shedding light on the defendants’ administration of the HMGP outweighs HMGP sellers’ weak privacy interests in nondisclosure of their names and of their former properties’ addresses and GIS coordinates,” she wrote in a 24-page opinion.FEMA argued that disclosing the information would lead to “unwanted public scrutiny” of the sellers, including inquiries from journalists. But Howell said FOIA could effectively be gutted if the prospect of questions from nosy reporters was enough to deny access to information.“Because FOIA requests almost always seek previously-unavailable information that sheds light on government activities, the government’s disclosure in every case may attract media interest,” wrote Howell, an appointee of President Barack Obama. “To allow an agency to invoke [a FOIA exemption for personal privacy] merely because the media might contact an individual in connection with a produced record would bring a vast number of FOIA requests within [the privacy exemption’s] auspices, undermining FOIA’s purpose of allowing ‘citizens to know what their Government is up to.’”Benincasa told the court that NPR wanted the information to try to assess whether FEMA was enforcing the rules of the program, which is intended to reduce the impact of flooding by putting properties in the hands of state or local governments or nonprofit organizations. Since 2000, the program paid $750 million to buy more than 10,000 properties, according to the NPR reporter.

"The suicide rate among teenage girls continues to rise and hit a 40-year high in 2015, according to a new analysis released Thursday.
Suicide rates doubled among girls and rose by more than 30 percent among teen boys and young men between 2007 and 2015, the updated breakdown from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds.
It’s all part of a growing national trend for more suicides, said CDC suicide expert Thomas Simon.
“There has been a substantial increase in suicide rates in adolescents aged 15 to 19 between 2007 and 2015,” Simon said.
“Nationally overall we have been seeing an increase in suicide rates that is pretty pervasive among all age groups,” added Simon. Overall suicide rates have gone up 28 percent since 2000, he said.
The new analysis from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics compares recent trends to data going back 40 years. It found the suicide rate for males aged 15 to 19 rose from 12 per 100,000 to 18 per 100,000 men and boys that age between 1975 and 1990. Suicide rates for boys fell between 1990 and 2007 and then started rising again, to 14 suicides for every 100,000 teenage boys by 2015.
“Rates for females aged 15–19 were lower than for males aged 15–19 but followed a similar pattern during 1975–2007,” the NCHS team wrote. “The rate in 2015 was the highest for females for the 1975–2015 period.”
In 2007, 4,320 children and young adults aged up to 24 died by suicide, the CDC says, making suicide among the top four causes of death for people 10 and up. In 2015, 5,900 kids and adults aged 10 to 24 died by suicide, separate CDC data shows.
“This increase in suicide rate is very concerning,” said Dr. Christine Moutier of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.
What’s going on? A lot of different things, Moutier and Simon both said.
“It is really important to understand that suicide happens as a culmination of multiple risk factors, always multiple, that pile on top and sort of converge at a moment in time,” Moutier said.
Economic recessions can be a big factor, even for kids, said Simon.
“One of the factors that people have talked about as potential contributor to the trend is the economic downturn that we saw in 2007-2009,” Simon said. “As economic problems go up, suicide rates go up.”
Whole families are affected, he said. “There is reason to believe that economic turmoil, financial stresses experienced by parents, can also affect vulnerable youth,” he said.

Violence is another big factor, the CDC says.
“Exposure to violence (e.g., child abuse and neglect, bullying, peer violence, dating violence, sexual violence, and intimate partner violence) is associated with increased risk of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, suicide, and suicide attempts,” the agency says in policy guidance.
Governments can make sure people have somewhere to live and economic support, the CDC advises.
Social media can help or hurt. What’s important is how it’s used, Simon and Moutier said.
""There is a potential for social media to be very helpful in reducing suicide,” Simon said. It can be a great way to get the word out about the signs of suicide risk, and about ways to help, he noted.
“There is also the potential for it to be harmful,” Simon added.
Cyberbullying is an obvious example, but social media can also spread myths or glamorize suicide.
“On the one hand, kids are at younger and younger ages, are being exposed to all sorts of influences via social media and so, one example that could do harm to a child who is at risk of mental health problems or suicide is that they are experiencing and perceiving themselves and the world around them through a lens that might be distorted by depression,” Moutier said.
Simon said suicide is preventable and parents, friends, teachers and others can be on the lookout for people at risk.
* Talking about feeling unbearable pain, or feeling like a burden to others
If someone shows any of the signs, it’s no time to mind your own business, Simon said.
“If they are vulnerable, it is important not to leave that person alone,” he said. One good resource is the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-8255.
“We should be alarmed today, yesterday and every day, because every day on average 16 American youth are taking their lives,” Moutier said.",0

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), right, walks with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to speak to reporters about the Republican plan to rewrite the tax code. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Tucked away in the much-anticipated Republican taxbill are a few provisions that are sure to rattle universities, student loan borrowers and anyone paying for college.  The legislation unveiled Thursday by House Republican leaderstaps into some proposals that havecreateddivision within the higher-education sector, including whether well-heeled schools are paying their fair share. It alsodelivers on some long-standing promises to simplify and streamline the credits and deductions provided to families and students, but in ways that may leave some Americans frustrated. Excise tax on endowments: Republicans want to impose a 1.4 percent excise tax on the net investment income of private colleges and universities whose endowments equal at least $100,000 per full-time student. Because the provision is directed at schools with 500 students or more, the tax couldtarget private schools with at least $50 million in endowment assets. Though the criteria tracks with a 2014 plan introduced by former Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), the threshold is much lower than congressional Republicans had discussed more recently and could hurt small private colleges that are struggling to stay afloat. TheNew America Foundation andthe National Association of College and University Business Officers estimate that about 150 private colleges and universities would meet the criteria for taxation. If a private university with a $50 million endowment made an annual return of 5 percent, that school could face a $35,000 tax bill under the proposal.   [Congress digs into issue of colleges using endowments to lower students’ costs]   In the summer of 2016, congressional Republicans asked 56 private universities, each with endowments exceeding $1 billion, for information about the use of that money. New York Republican Rep. Tom Reed had introduced a bill requiring colleges with endowments above $1 billion to set aside up to 25 percent of their investment earnings toward financial aid, or risk losing tax-exempt status. Wealthy universities have drawn criticism from lawmakers for raising tuition far in excess of inflation while sitting on hefty endowments. Schoolshave derided the attention on their endowments as misguided and argued that they are not savings accounts that can easily be drawn down.   [Universities in D. C. avoided $111 million in local taxes last year]   Collegesmaintain endowments, a collection of tax-exempt donations and investments, to pay for salaries, research, financial aid and other expenses. Donors often place conditions on their money, directing the funds be used for only athletics or to support specific kinds of research, for instance. As a result, schools often say their hands are tied, but many higher-education expertssay that universities could restructure their policies.Liz Clark, director of federal affairs at NACUBO, argues that the provision is not a perfect way of looking at a private university’s finances because many schools use their funds for research endeavors. Republicans say imposing the excise tax could yield $3 billion over the next 10 years. Student loan interest, tuition reductions and education assistance:The GOP plan would no longer allow people repaying their student loans to reduce their tax burden by up to $2,500. People whose employers cover a portion of their college costswould also see the moneybecometaxable income. The plan would also do away with a tuition tax break for university employees and their families. As it stands, tuition discounts provided to that group are excluded from income, under whatare known as qualified tuition reductions. Republicans estimate that doing away with all of those deductions and tax breaks will increase government revenue by $47.5 billion over the next decade. College tax credit consolidation: The three higher-education tax credits — the American Opportunity Tax Credit, Lifetime Learning Credit and Hope Scholarship Credit — would be folded into one credit.That new benefitwould credit families for the first $2,000 spent on tuition, books and supplies, and provide an additional 25 percent tax credit for the next $2,000 spent. Republicans are also proposing to make the credit available for a fifth year of college at half the rate as the first four years, with up to $500 of the credit being refundable.   [Paying for college? Have student loans? Here%u2019s what you need to know before filing your taxes.]   Streamlining the jumble of tax credits could increase revenue for the government by $17.3 billion over 10 years, according to the plan. Thatis likely because the new credit would squeeze graduate students, especially PhD candidates who spent far longer than five years in college. Tax credits are a controversial way to help families affordcollege. The federal government has spent more than $23 billion a year on the three education tax credits, but a lot of that money goes to families making at least $100,000, according to the Tax Policy Center.   [Tax credits are a bad way to help families pay for college. Here’s why.]   In 2015, President Barack Obama proposed consolidating all of the credits into one program to the benefit of people attending college less than half the time, as a way of ensuring more low-income students wouldreceive help. But his plan failed to gain much support, especially after the president included a proposal to end a major tax benefit of a popular college savings account, known as a 529 plan, to help pay for the expansion. Coverdell Education Savings Accounts:Republicans would like to phase out Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, which allow families to invest without the earnings being taxed as long as the funds are used to pay for collegeorprivate school.The account is akin to the more popular 529 plans for college, but has a much lower contribution limit of $2,000. By comparison, individuals can pour up to $14,000 a year into a 529 plan.   [This is the best way to save for college. And hardly anyone uses it.]   The House tax plan would phase out Coverdells by prohibiting new contributions and expanding 529 plans to cover up to $10,000 a year in elementary and high school expenses. It would also include expenses associated with apprenticeship programs. Both additions are a clear nod to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s push to shift more federal dollars to private schools and focus greater attention on vocational training. Republicans estimate that phasing out Coverdells will yield about $600 million over the next decade. Tax bills for death and disability discharges:The House plan would put an end to the government counting student debt that is forgivenbecause of death or disability as taxable income, a move that could cost $100 million over 10 years.   [t Feds refuse to stop taxing the canceled student debt of severely disabled people]   The tax burden gained attention in 2016 after Obama announced plans to forgive $7.7 billion in federal student loans held by nearly 400,000 permanently disabled people through a matching system. The Social Security Administration and the Education Department teamed to pinpoint borrowers receiving disability payments, under the specific designation of “Medical Improvement Not Expected,” which indicates they are eligible for the discharge. Anyone with a severe disability is eligible to have the government discharge their federal student loans. Every dollar forgiven by the government, however, is considered taxable income. Congressional lawmakers have in the past urged the Treasury Department to use its administrative authority to do away with the tax burden, butTreasury said it was up to Congress to take action.",0
"Medal-winning Olympic marathon runner Feyisa Lilesa fears he will be arrested or even killed after making a symbolic protest against Ethiopia's government at the Rio games.
The father-of-two told reporters he may seek asylum in another country after defiantly making a crossed-arms gesture — in support of the Oromo tribe, the country’s largest — at the finish line on Sunday.
He later repeated the action at the ceremony to receive his silver medal.
Oromos have been protesting Ethiopian government plans to reallocate farmland for development, prompting fierce demonstrations last November and months of unrest.
Rights groups say hundreds have been killed, but the government disputes the figures and says illegal protests by ""anti-peace forces"" have been brought under control.
“They will kill me,” Lilesa told reporters in Rio when asked about the consequences of his gesture. “If not, they will [arrest and] charge me.”
He said he was considering applying for asylum to remain in Brazil or to go another country.
“If I get [a] visa, I will move to America,” Lilesa added.
The situation for his family in Ethiopia was “dangerous,” he said in an interview recorded by running news site, Let's Run.
At an official news conference following his medal ceremony, Lilesa said he made the protest because ""Oromo is my tribe ... Oromo people now protest [for] what is right, for peace, for a place.”
The move, though, immediately sparked fears for his and his family's safety.
Within hours, a Gofundme account set up for Lilesa had raised $36,000 of the target $40,000 sought by well-wishers who described him as an “Ethiopian hero.”
There was no mention of Lilesa’s protest, or even of his silver medal, on the Ethiopian government’s website or in English-language Ethiopian media Monday.
Ethiopia has long been one of the world's poorest nations but has industrialized rapidly in the past decade. However, reallocating land is a thorny issue for Ethiopians, many of whom are subsistence farmers.
Authorities scrapped the land development scheme in January, but protests flared again this month over the continued detention of opposition demonstrators. Amnesty International said at last 97 people were killed and hundreds more injured “when Ethiopian security forces fired live bullets at peaceful protesters.”
Ethiopia is a U. S. ally and a relatively stable nation in a region where Islamist militants are waging a campaign of terror.",0

House Republicans approved a budget plan yesterday that’s the first step toward passing a big tax cut. More than half of the tax cut’s benefits would flow to the top 1 percent of earners — those earning at least $733,000 a year. On average, each of those households would receive an infusion of $130,000 each year.
In related news, two Democratic senators have introduced a bill that would cut the child poverty rate almost in half, by increasing the child tax credit. The total cost of their bill happens to be similar to the cost of the tax cut flowing only to the top 1 percent — both are in the neighborhood of $100 billion a year. If anything, the anti-poverty plan would probably cost less.
Which do you think sounds like a more urgent national priority: cutting this country’s depressingly-high child poverty rate or sending $130,000 a year to every household in the top 1 percent?
The child credit plan, writes Dylan Matthews of Vox, is “one of the most exciting bills I’ve ever seen in my time covering Congress.” He explains the details here.

"Latino advocates and legislators from both parties criticized the Trump administration's announcement that it would terminate a program that allows about 3,000 Nicaraguans to stay and work in the U. S. legally as well as delay the decision on whether to extend the program to recipients from Honduras.
In a statement issued Monday night, the Department of Homeland Security said that Nicaraguans with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) have until Jan. 5, 2019 in order to return home or seek a permanent immigration status. Otherwise, they will become undocumented.
TPS, which was first given to Nicaragua and Honduras in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch, seeks to protect people from countries ravaged by natural disasters or civil war. DHS can renew the program for up to 18 months at a time.
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke “determined that those substantial but temporary conditions caused in Nicaragua by Hurricane Mitch no longer exist, and thus, under the applicable statute, the current TPS designation must be terminated,” the statement said.
But supporters of the program say Nicaraguan TPS holders have deep roots in the community and have been in the country for decades.
Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, (R-Fl), is one of several Florida Republicans who had called for an extension of TPS; he criticized the decision in a statement.
""I am deeply pained by and strongly disagree with the decision to phase out the Temporary Protected Status for Nicaraguan nationals living in the United States,"" said Díaz-Balart. ""They are hardworking individuals who have substantial roots in this country and have made contributions to our society and local economies.""
A bipartisan coalition of legislators led by Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., proposed a bill last week that would grant TPS recipients from Honduras, Haiti, El Salvador and Nicaragua a chance to apply for permanent residency.
On Tuesday a group that included immigration and legal advocates criticized the delay in extending TPS to approximately 60,000 Hondurans protected by the program, who will receive TPS until July 2018.
""Every 16 hours there is a woman killed in Honduras,"" said Oscar Chacón from the Alianza Américas, stating the country remains one of the most dangerous places in the world.
As it stands, TPS does not lead to a green card in the first place, but individuals who were covered under the program and meet the normal qualifications can apply to stay and work here permanently.
Congress is the only body with the authority to create a path to permanent legal status for TPS holders.
Trump officials are expected to issue decisions on the future of TPS for 50,000 Haitians in November and 200,000 Salvadorans in January.
In March, DHS extended TPS for Haiti by six months, although many interpreted this move as a sign that they opposed the program and would be terminating it this fall.
“We are looking at the fact that temporary protected status means temporary, and it has not been temporary for many years,"" DHS spokesman David Lapan said earlier this month. ""We, the U. S. government, have created a situation where people have lived in this country a long time.""
The presidents of both Honduras and El Salvador have urged the Trump administration to extend the program, citing the contributions that TPS holders make to their economies by sending money home and the destabilizing effects of thousands of people returning.
Nicaragua made no such call to the U. S. government, according to the DHS statement.
Cecilia Menjívar, a professor of sociology at Kansas University who studies TPS, said that most Central American immigrants protected by the program have been in the U. S. for about 20 years and are unlikely to leave, regardless of the DHS decision.
“They have roots in this country. They have children here, and mortgages here,“ she said. “That will send them underground, and make them subject to all sorts of abuses, but also without being able to contribute to the economy in the way they have been.”
Belinda Osorio, a Honduran-American who lives and works in Florida and has been in the U. S. for decades through TPS, told reporters at a conference call on Tuesday that she would not put her 14-year-old son in danger by going back to Honduras, regardless of the administration's eventual decision.
""My kids deserve to live in their home country,"" said Osorio, who works at the Walt Disney resort in Orlando. ""I'm not taking my family to a dangerous zone.  I'm not leaving.""",0

"WASHINGTON -- The military's role in Hurricane Harvey rescue and recovery efforts has been limited by weather and flooding but could soon expand by tenfold or more, a senior National Guard officer said Tuesday.
Air Force Maj. Gen. James Witham told reporters there currently are about 3,500 National Guard troops involved, including about 3,000 from the Texas National Guard. He estimated that the Texas guard number could rise to 8,000 to 10,000 in coming days, possibly joined by 20,000 to 30,000 from other states.
Witham is the director of domestic operations for the National Guard Bureau.
He said the military is providing everything that has been requested by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, although the response is constrained by the stormy weather and by flooding that limits use of roadways. He said weather has limited the use of military helicopters over the past two or three days, so the Guard has instead used boats and ground vehicles to rescue stranded residents in the Houston area.
Besides the additional National Guard troops from other states, there are about 1,000 active-duty military forces in position to provide assistance if called up by civilian authorities, he said.
Asked whether Texas authorities recognized the magnitude of the disaster quickly enough, Witham said, ""That's debatable."" He said in some respects the need was recognized quickly. But the extraordinary amount of rainfall and flooding exceeded what state planners could have foreseen.
""So if you're looking at an event that only occurs every few hundred years, the planning that would have normally occurred for that probably wasn't here,"" Witham said. ""So, in many cases, the request for assistance, not only for the National Guard but federal forces, may not have been anticipated quickly enough.""",0
"Long ago “The Simpsons” ceased being The Little Engine That Could. At this point, it is The Gigantic Engine That Can Never Be Shut Off. Today, nearly halfway through its 26th season, it’s aired 561 original episodes and earned billions of dollars for a lot of people — despite featuring characters with four fingers on each hand.
But even the most loyal “Simpsons” viewers can’t know everything about the beloved series, which premiered 25 years ago, on Dec. 17, 1989 — so here’s a collection of those lesser-known tidbits.
Honorary Squishees to all who recognize more than 20!
1. Paul and Linda McCartney agreed to lend their voices to the 1995 episode “Lisa the Vegetarian”on the condition that the character of Lisa remain a vegetarian throughout the run of the series. She still is.
2. Substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom, from the 1991 episode “Lisa’s Substitute,” was voiced by Dustin Hoffman, but the actor preferred to use the cheeky alias Sam Etic (a.k.a. “semitic”) instead.
3. Groening himself provides the pacifier-sucking sound for baby Maggie.
4. The names Marge, Homer, Lisa, Maggie and Patty are all taken from creator Matt Groening’s real-life parents, sisters, and aunt. But Bart is simply an anagram of “Brat.” As for the name “Simpson,” Groening found it appropriate to feature a surname that literally described “the son of a simp.”
5. The “The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson” episode of the series (from 1997) didn’t air in syndication for five years after the 9/11 attacks due to its focus on the World Trade Center.
6. Why are the Simpsons characters yellow? Because Groening thought seeing flashes of yellow would stop channel surfers in their tracks.
7. God and Jesus are the only “Simpsons”characters with five fingers. The others all have four.
9. Each of the six principal “Simpsons”voice stars — Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Hank Azaria, Yeardley Smith and Harry Shearer — earns $300,000 per episode, after taking pay cuts from $400,000 in 2011. When the show launched in 1989, they earned $4,000 each per episode.
10. Principal Seymour Skinner’s real name is Armin Tamzarian. And Comic Book Guy’s name is Jeff Albertson.
11. The series features a coffee house called Java the Hut, a soup kitchen called Helter Shelter, a pastry shop called The French Confection and the gun store Bloodbath and Beyond. (And that’s just a smattering of the punny store names.)
12. Dan Castellaneta’s “D’oh!” is an homage to Jimmy Finlayson’s “Doooh!” in the Laurel & Hardy films. It is written in scripts simply as “annoyed grunt.”
13. Danny Elfman required just two days to compose the now-iconic “Simpsons” theme song in 1989.
14. Groening called the town Springfield because there are literally dozens of Springfields across the country, so the series would be identified with no single state.
15. Krusty the Klown was originally created to be Homer’s secret identity, as Homer knew Bart worshiped Krusty, if not him. But Groening ultimately thought the disguise gambit too complicated, so it was scrapped.
16. In 1998, Time magazine named Bart Simpson one of the most influential “people” of the century.
17. In 1997, there was a contest to win a fully-furnished exact replica of the “Simpsons” house in Clark County, Nev. The winner could choose to either stay in the home or trade it for $75,000. The winner took the money. The house was ultimately stripped of its “Simpsons” décor before being sold.
18. The voice actors who play Homer and Marge in the French dubbed version of the show, Phillipe Peythieu and Veronique Augereau, got married in real life in 2001 after having met on the show in 1989.
19. Following Phil Hartman’s death in 1998, the show retired all of his characters, including actor/eternal spokesman Troy McClure and attorney Lionel Hutz.
20. The 1992 episode “Stark Raving Dad” features the voice of Michael Jackson talking, but not singing. It was Jackson’s idea to use sound-alike Kipp Lennon instead.
21. Prior to “The Simpsons,” the longest running prime-time animated series on network television was “The Flintstones,” which ran for six seasons between 1960-66.
22. Bart’s best friend, Milhouse Van Houten, has a unusual middle name: Mussolini.
23. The sale of “Simpsons” toys and figurines is illegal in Iran.
24. Since launching in 1989, the series has featured more than 600 guest stars, easily the most of any scripted series in television history.
25. If “The Simpsons'”characters had aged in real time, Homer would be 62 years old, Marge 61, Bart 36, Lisa 34 and Maggie 26. And family pet Santa’s Little Helper would be 196 in dog years.
Ray Richmond is the author of the 1997 episodic compendium The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family (HarperCollins). It is now, sadly, less than one-third “complete.”",1

France is officially the first country in the world to ban pro-palestinian and anti-Israel demonstrations. This move made by France’s Socialist government is a real threat to democracy,and freedom of speech.
“Socialist Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, says mass demonstrations planned for the weekend should be halted. Minister Cazeneuve stated there was a ‘threat to public order’, while opponents said he was ‘criminalizing’ popular support of the Palestinian people.
Minister Cazeneuve welcomed a legal procedure instigated by the Paris police prefecture to ban the march, despite it already being widely advertised. Anyone who turns up to an illegal demonstration now faces up to a year in prison, and a 15,000 euro fine. If they hide their faces to avoid being identified, this sentence can be increased to three years, and a 45,000 fine.
Even those who publish details of an illegal rally on social media face up to a year in prison, and a 15,000 euro fine. This can be increased to seven years and a 100,000 fine if the postings lead to violence. Mr. Cazeneuve also advised other prefects across France to examine planned marches on a ‘case by case’ basis, and to ban ‘if appropriate’.”",1
"A new study published Thursday reported a disturbing correlation between unusually high levels of radon gas in mostly residences and an oil and gasproduction technique known as fracking that has become the industry standard over the past decade.
Writing in the journal Environmental Health Perspective,researchers analyzed levels of radon —a colorless, odorless gas that is radioactive and has been linked to lung cancer —in 860,000 buildings from 1989 to 2013. They found that those inthe same areas of the state as the fracking operations generally showedhigher readings of radon. About 42 percent of the readings were higher than what is considered safe byfederal standards.Moreover, the researchers discovered that radon levels spiked overall in 2004, at aboutthe same time fracking activity began to pick up.
Hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” involves drilling 6,500to 10,000 feetbelow the surface, and scientists theorize that radon trapped inrocks there is releasedinto the atmosphere.
“By drilling 7,000 holes in the ground, the fracking industry may have changed the geology and created new pathways for radon to rise to the surface,” one of the authors, Joan A. Casey from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, warned.
Researchers have alsoreported concerns about similar radon releases in parts of Coloradowhere fracking is also booming. In a study published by the U. S. Geological Survey in 2012, governmentresearchers found that the radiation in water in the AppalachianBasin in parts of New York and Pennsylvania near fracking work in the Marcellus Shalewas unusuallyhigh.
The natural gas industry has pointed out that fracking has been conducted safely for years.In response to the Pennsylvania study, Energy in Depth, a program of theIndependent Petroleum Association of America issued a statementpointing out issues with the research. It noted that the state’s own department of environmental protection has reported that there is “little potential for additional radiation exposure to the public due to the use of natural gas extracted from geological formations” in Pennsylvania, that the state has had issues with naturally occurring radon long before shale development, and that some of the highest radon readings were in counties in where there are no wells.
“In other words, the authors want to remind readers to look at this as an exploratory analysis because they were missing a few key items to make their claims. But that didn’t stop them from blaming fracking as if they did,” Energy in Depth’s Nicole Jacobs wrote in a blog post published Thursday afternoon.",1
"You’ve got a great idea for a brand-new business, or you’re tired of the 9-to-5 grind and want to take your success into your own hands. Either way, you’re excited to turn this dream into reality.
But leaving your current job without a backup plan can be a risky thing. Everything you’ve saved is likely going to living expenses not into the business. Grants and business loans can be difficult to obtain and searching for investors is a full-time job on its own.
On the surface, this all seems problematic. But a lack of personal capital shouldn’t stop you from pursuing your dream business. In fact, it’s entirely possible to start and grow a business with almost no personal financial investment whatsoever — if you know what you’re doing.
Here are two key tips on how to start a business with little or no money: Reduce your expenses or increase your available capital from outside sources.
Depending on where you live and what business you want to create, your startup expenses will vary greatly. However,according to the SBA, you can start your own business for less than $3,000, and home-based franchises can be started for as little as $1,000. So, what do these startup expenses look like?
While not every business model will require each of these items to launch, there are a few expenses that you won’t be able to avoid. Licensing and operational expenses will inevitably require some spending, but you may be able to adjust your business model to demand fewer needs initially or utilize low-cost alternatives.
It’s popular for a reason: with a good idea and enough work, you can attract funding for anything. Many sites that help fund businesses through crowdfunding require you to offer a reward, take on debt through peer-to-peer lending, or offer equity lending (receive investments in exchange for shares in your new business). Carefully weigh out what you are willing to do in exchange for raising startup capital. Crowdfunding options more like Moonlighting’s solution throughMoon$hot Stories, let you raise funds with only a simple, small flat fee that is only assessed on funds raised.
Crowdfunding success on any platform is tied to the amount of work you put into your business idea before launch and the effort you make to share your crowdfunding campaign.
One way to start a business with little to no startup capital is to sell your services, instead of a physical product. There’s a huge variety of services you can offer, depending on your background and interests. For example, you can offer these services with little equipment or capital investment:
Because you are selling your services, you will need a branding plan to make sure your name and company get in front of the people who may need the service. Moonlighting is the perfect platform to build your mobile and online presence, promoting your services to people looking for help.
With one or more of these options, you can reduce your personal financial investment to almost nothing. Startup capital is a major hurdle to overcome, but make no mistake — it can be overcome and if you believe in your business dream, nothing can stand in your way!

"(Before It's News)Humans migrated out of Africa as the climate shifted from wet to very dry about 60,000 years ago, according to research led by a University of Arizona geoscientist.
Genetic research indicates people migrated from Africa into Eurasia between 70,000 and 55,000 years ago. Previous researchers suggested the climate must have been wetter than it is now for people to migrate to Eurasia by crossing the Horn of Africa and the Middle East.
“There’s always been a question about whether climate change had any influence on when our species left Africa,” said Jessica Tierney, UA associate professor of geosciences. “Our data suggest that when most of our species left Africa, it was dry and not wet in northeast Africa.”
The Lamont-Doherty Core Repository contains one of the world’s most unique and important collection of scientific samples from the deep sea. Sediment cores from every major ocean and sea are archived here. The repository provides for long-term curation and archiving of samples and cores to ensure their preservation and usefulness to current and future generations of scientists.

Tierney and her colleagues found that around 70,000 years ago, climate in the Horn of Africa shifted from a wet phase called “Green Sahara” to even drier than the region is now. The region also became colder.
The researchers traced the Horn of Africa’s climate 200,000 years into the past by analyzing a core of ocean sediment taken in the western end of the Gulf of Aden. Tierney said before this research there was no record of the climate of northeast Africa back to the time of human migration out of Africa.
“Our data say the migration comes after a big environmental change. Perhaps people left because the environment was deteriorating,” she said. “There was a big shift to dry and that could have been a motivating force for migration.”
“It’s interesting to think about how our ancestors interacted with climate,” she said.
The team’s paper, “A climatic context for the out-of-Africa migration,” is published online in Geology this week. Tierney’s co-authors are Peter deMenocal of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York, and Paul Zander of the UA.
The National Science Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation funded the research.
Tierney and her colleagues had successfully revealed the Horn of Africa’s climate back to 40,000 years ago by studying cores of marine sediment. The team hoped to use the same means to reconstruct the region’s climate back to the time 55,000 to 70,000 years ago when our ancestors left Africa.
The first challenge was finding a core from that region with sediments that old. The researchers enlisted the help of the curators of the Lamont-Doherty Core Repository, which has sediment cores from every major ocean and sea. The curators found a core collected off the Horn of Africa in 1965 from the R/V Robert D. Conrad that might be suitable.
Co-author deMenocal studied and dated the layers of the 1965 core and found it had sediments going back as far as 200,000 years.
At the UA, Tierney and Paul Zander teased out temperature and rainfall records from the organic matter preserved in the sediment layers. The scientists took samples from the core about every four inches (10 cm), a distance that represented about every 1,600 years.
To construct a long-term temperature record for the Horn of Africa, the researchers analyzed the sediment layers for chemicals called alkenones made by a particular kind of marine algae. The algae change the composition of the alkenones depending on the water temperature. The ratio of the different alkenones indicates the sea surface temperature when the algae were alive and also reflects regional temperatures, Tierney said.
To figure out the region’s ancient rainfall patterns from the sediment core, the researchers analyzed the ancient leaf wax that had blown into the ocean from terrestrial plants. Because plants alter the chemical composition of the wax on their leaves depending on how dry or wet the climate is, the leaf wax from the sediment core’s layers provides a record of past fluctuations in rainfall.
The analyses showed that the time people migrated out of Africa coincided with a big shift to a much drier and colder climate, Tierney said.
The team’s findings are corroborated by research from other investigators who reconstructed past regional climate by using data gathered from a cave formation in Israel and a sediment core from the eastern Mediterranean. Those findings suggest that it was dry everywhere in northeast Africa, she said.
“Our main point is kind of simple,” Tierney said. “We think it was dry when people left Africa and went on to other parts of the world, and that the transition from a Green Sahara to dry was a motivating force for people to leave.”",1
"A historically black college in Florida invited U. S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to speak at its commencement ceremony later this month —and liberals are freaking out.
Bethune-Cookman University, a private, historically black college in Daytona Beach, Florida,announced Monday thatDeVos was slated to be the keynote speaker at the May 10 ceremony.
In a newsrelease announcing the speaker, the universitycompared DeVos to its founder, Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune. According to Biography.com, Bethune was an educator and civil rights activistwho served as the president of the National Association of Colored Women and founded the National Council of Negro Women. Shefounded Bethune-Cookman University in 1904and died in 1955.
“Much like Dr. Bethune, Secretary DeVos deems the importance of opportunity and hope for students to receive an exceptional education experience,” the universitystated. “Her mission to empower parents and students resonates with the history and legacy of Dr. Bethune.”
B-CU President Edison Jackson piled on the praise for both DeVos, also likeningher to Bethune, whohe said was not bound by her political affiliations.
“The legacy of Dr. Bethune is that she was not constrained by political ideology, but worked across all parties to support B-CU,” Jackson said.
It wasn’t long after B-CU made the announcement that liberals began criticizing the pick.
“America deserves better than Betsy DeVos. So does Bethune-Cookman,” one person tweeted, along with a defamatory photo of DeVos with a reference to her infamous “grizzlies”commentfrom her Senate confirmation hearing.
“To compare Mary McLeod Bethune to Betsy Devos is blasphemy,” another user tweeted.
And yet, another added there is “no comparison” between the two women.
Now, with just a week to go until commencement, more than 5,000 online users have called on the college to “rescind” the invitation to DeVos. A Change.org petition claims that DeVos “doesn’t understand that HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] were created because African-Americans were excluded from mainstream institutions.”
The petition cited DeVos saying in a statement in February that HCBUs are “the real pioneers when it comes to school choice.” DeVos later clarified what she meant, acknowledging that black people’s attendance at HBCUS’s was “not out of mere choice, but out of necessity,” the New York Times reported.
The Change.org petition acknowledged that even though DeVos corrected herself “the damage was already done.”
“It would be enough if that was the only error DeVos has committed to insult the HBCU community,” the petition declared. The petition cites a Department of Education memorandum, issued April 11, which would reverse the previous administration’s attempt to let student borrowers pay back their loans according to what they made.
Given that a majority of B-CU students receive some form of financial aid and that the median income of a B-CU graduate is only $22,000 per year for the first two years after having graduated, “this would make it virtually impossible to immediately begin to pay off an estimated $52,000 in student loan debt” from B-CU, the Change.org petition stated.
“Having DeVos speak at the commencement ceremony is an insult to the B-CU graduating class, students, alumni, family, friends, and Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune’s legacy,” the petition stated. “We, the proud alumni of Bethune-Cookman University, do not want Betsy DeVos to have a seat at our table. Please rescind her invitation to speak at the graduation ceremony.”",0
"(Before It's News)Researchers at the University of York working on a 700-year old abandoned agricultural site in Tanzania have shown that soil erosion benefited farming practices for some 500 years.
The study, published inQuaternary Research, shows that historical practices of capturing soils that were eroded from the hillside could be valuable to modern day farming techniques.
Research demonstrated that sophisticated irrigation systems and terraces at the site of Engaruka were not built to prevent soil erosion, as originally thought, but were instead built to capture eroded sediments to feed the arid landscape below.

Research demonstrated that sophisticated irrigation systems and terraces at the site of Engaruka were not built to prevent soil erosion, as originally thought, but were instead built to capture eroded sediments to feed the arid landscape below.
Engaruka first came under the spotlight in 1935 and was thought, at the time, to be a ‘lost city’ of up to 40,000 inhabitants. It has since been recognised as the remains of the largest abandoned system of irrigated agricultural fields and terraces in sub-Saharan Africa.
Engaruka is on the tourist trail, but most well known for its wildlife

Covering 20km2, the site was mysteriously abandoned 200 years ago, which some experts believe was due to climate change or deforestation reducing the water supply to the fields.
Dr Carol Lang, from the University of York’s Department of Archaeology, said: “This area of east Africa attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists each year, many visiting the Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area to see the wildlife and meet Maasai herders. Very few, however, realise the archaeological importance of the plains below the parks.
“We knew before starting our work that an irrigation system of this size required more water than is available in the area today, but what we have found is that the site used to flood, and that the inhabitants carefully manipulated these floods to grow crops and to accumulate vast quantities of sediments.”
Engaruka is now home to tribes of livestock herders, but the land no longer produces food crop as it once did
Credit: University of York
Using a combination of archaeological excavation, soil micromorphology and geochemical analyses, this research turns on its head the assumption that soil erosion is always a bad thing.
Dr Daryl Stump, Principal Investigator for the project, said: “The inhabitants of ancient Engaruka were clearly highly skilled landscape engineers and agricultural managers, and there are lessons to be learnt here that can be applied to modern farming.
“Since recognising these sediment traps at Engaruka, our team has found very similar structures at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Konso in Ethiopia, where farmers report that sediment traps are more economically important than hillside terraces.”
By presenting this research at international meetings, team members have also helped identify what seem to be very similar structures in South America, the Middle East and India, suggesting that this method of farming was once far more widespread.

"Some 2,000 Islamic State (IS) militants remain in the Syrian city of Raqqa amid an offensive to recapture the group's stronghold, a senior US official says.
Brett McGurk, special envoy for the coalition against IS, says US-backed forces have seized about 45% of Raqqa since the operation started in June.
He says the group is fighting for its own survival and that the militants are likely to die in the city.
IS seized Raqqa in 2014, proclaiming it the capital of a ""caliphate"".
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been gradually advancing on the city since November, and launched an offensive to take it on 6 June.
It is unclear how many civilians are still in Raqqa, but the United Nations estimates this number to be between 20,000 and 50,000.
The loss of Raqqa would be another major setback for IS after the jihadist group was driven from its main Iraqi bastion of Mosul last month.
The militants have lost 78% of the territory they held in Iraq and 58% of what they had in Syria, Mr McGurk added.
""Today in Raqqa, Isis is fighting for every last block... and fighting for their own survival,"" he said, using another acronym for IS.  ""They most likely will die in Raqqa.""
More than 300,000 people have lost their lives in six years of conflict in Syria, which began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad before escalating into a full-scale civil war. Eleven million people have been displaced by the fighting.",0
"Flu season is upon us, and before long it's likely to seem like people are coughing and sniffling everywhere you turn. New research sheds light on a group of people who may be especially likely to spread the infection to others: millennials.
According to the new survey of 1,800 American adults released by CityMD, millennials (ages 18-34) who have had the flu or flu-like symptoms were much more likely than those 35 and older to have ventured out the last time they felt sick, potentially exposing friends, neighbors and co-workers. About three-quarters of millennials admitted to going out sick, compared to 56 percent of older adults.
Of those who left the house, the most common place they went was a drug store, followed by a grocery store. Nearly 40 percent said they went to work sick. Smaller numbers went to a family or friend's house, a restaurant or deli, public transportation, and even the gym while they were ill.
""Most millennials are young and healthy. Many of them probably never even had the flu before so they may think some of their symptoms are just extended cold-like symptoms and so they may underestimate how long it takes to recover from it."" Dr. David Shih, executive vice president of strategy, health and innovation at CityMD, told CBS News.
Shih said in general, many healthy young people tend to ""think they're invincible.""
However, this attitude is problematic because even if they can bounce back quickly, they may be putting others at risk.
""The flu is one of those silent and contagious diseases that we see every year and millions of Americans get the flu. Unfortunately, there are some population segments that are more at risk like the elderly, the very young, and pregnant women,"" Shih said. ""When we have a large population who are out and about in public spaces with the flu, there is a higher exposure.""
For many, the flu causes moderate symptoms that ease after a few days, but for others it can lead to severe illness and sometimes even death.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the flu has caused between 140,000 and 710,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths annually since 2010. The numbers can vary widely depending on how severe each year's flu season turns out to be.
Health officials are concerned that the2017-18 flu season in the U. S. may be particularly bad because the Southern Hemisphere, especially Australia, was hit hard over the past few months with a flu strain that's notorious for causing severe illness, especially in older adults.
People with other serious health conditions are at greater at risk of dying from the flu, but even young and otherwise healthy people can sometimes develop fatal complications.
The CDC recommends everyone age 6 months and older should get a flu shot before the end of October, if possible, each year. This is the primary means of prevention against the flu.
Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body, which takes about two weeks after vaccination.
The seasonal flu shot protects against the four strains that research indicates will be the most common during the upcoming season.
""Now, there are times where they may be off or they may be wrong, but getting a flu shot will still decrease your likelihood of getting the flu because there's always going to be some minor variations but there's definitely enough similarities for your body to pick up the defenses,"" Shih said.
Studies have also shown that even people who get the flu despite having gotten the flu shot tend to have milder symptoms and recover more quickly.
The common cold and the flu are both respiratory illnesses but they are caused by different viruses. Colds are usually milder than the flu and people with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose.
* Some      people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in      children than adults.
If you're not sure whether your illness is a cold or the flu, there are tests your doctor can run to find out.
The virus is spread mainly by droplets in the air when infected people cough, sneeze, or talk. People who are sick with the flu can spread it to others up to 6 feet away.
In order to prevent spread of the flu, those who are sick should always cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing and wash their hands frequently with warm water and soap or use hand sanitizer.
Flu germs can also last on surfaces for up to 24 hours, depending on the surface. The harder the surface, the longer germs can last. So, one person with the flu who coughs into their hand and then later grabs ahold of a doorknob or picks up the office coffeepot can quickly infect many others.
Shih says many people believe that after one or two days, you are no longer contagious. However, that's not true.
""As long as you're coughing, sneezing, dripping, you're exposing germs whether to the air or to a surface,"" Shih said.
While it's very common for people to want to get back to work and their daily routines soon after getting sick with the flu, experts advise against rushing things.
The length of the illness will vary from person to person. Young, healthy people may bounce back very quickly, but in others flu symptoms may take up to two weeks to completely go away, Shih said.
""The general advice for a patient is to really take the 3 to 5 days to rest and only exercise and go about your daily business once you feel you have the energy,"" he said.",0
"In the aftermath of Harvey, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told his state that a new normal would have to be built.
Health experts, for instance, have warned that sewage in the floodwater could make people sick and that mosquito populations could explode in the coming weeks because stagnant water offers abundant breeding grounds.
Altogether, more than 1,000 homes in Texas were destroyed and close to 50,000 damaged, and over 32,000 people were in shelters across the state, emergency officials reported. About 10,000 more National Guard troops are being deployed to Texas, bringing the total to 24,000, Abbott said.
In the midst of a dramatically changing landscape in Texas since Harvey, officials, first responders, and volunteers nevertheless are forging ahead to bring relief to every kind of suffering thought imaginable.
Abbott sets the Texas agenda in his deep-red state using a measured, lawyerly demeanor, but last week he uncharacteristically seized the spotlight as Harvey was nearing his state’s Gulf Coast.
The Republican governor warned presciently of what is happening now: floods still rising and the kind of water rescues as dangerous to victims as first responders. He said last week that Houston residents “should strongly consider evacuating” even if not told to do so by local officials: “You have the power and the ability to avoid being stuck into a search and rescue situation.”
The death toll from Harvey stood at 39 Thursday evening, according to the Associated Press, and was still expected to rise.
The people most likely to be found dead are the elderly, the sick and the people who were isolated from others — along with folks who didn’t have the means or wherewithal to flee. Sometimes it’s a matter of having the strength to wade through flood waters a few blocks to safety, or to pull up onto a roof.
Annette Fuller of Houston took a video when she began fearing for her life on Sunday. She was on the second floor of a neighbor’s home along with the residents of three other houses, including five children, as water rose and hit waist level on the first floor. “We called 911 and it rang and rang and rang and rang,” Fuller said Monday after the water receded and she managed to return safely to her single-story home.
“There’s just no agency in the world that could handle Harvey,” she said. “However, none of us were warned that 911 might not work. It was very frightening.”
Fuller’s two daughters, who live in Austin and Dallas, posted her video to Facebook after their mother texted it to them, and the post went viral.
“Social media, in some ways, is more powerful than the government agencies,” Fuller said.
Nearby, Patrick Tobias stood at the edge of the road, wide eyes watching the muddy water flow like a river down what was once his community’s Main Street.
The 53-year-old welder approached a boat being loaded into the water, and asked for a ride to his apartment to retrieve heart medications and family belongings. Tobias lumbered into the boat and it buzzed down the street, navigating the currents at the community’s main intersection, with streetlights and signs sticking out of the water.
“Make a right here,” Tobias said, and the boat passed more submerged cars, coming to a stop in his apartment’s parking lot.
Tobias waded through waist-high water and climbed the steps up to his apartment, which he hadn’t seen since evacuating. Inside, it smelled of rotten food. The living room was filled with left-behind inflatable toys that were blown up to protect his wife and daughter as the floodwaters rose.
Tobias walked into his bedroom and found his medication, and loaded keepsakes and belongings into a massive garbage bag. He hiked it onto his shoulder like Santa Claus and waded back to the boat.
A neighbor came out onto his stairwell across the way, wearing a bathrobe and looking shaken. He stared blankly at Tobias. He went back inside, not answering calls to him asking if he needed help.
Tobias grew quiet. When he did speak, his voice cracked:
“Where do we go from here?”
Harvey is being called the first hurricane to go viral in the digital age.
Houston Police SWAT Officer Daryl Hudeck, in baseball cap and fatigues, was pictured carrying a Houston mom and her sleeping baby through knee-deep floodwaters water covering Interstate 610 in southwest Houston. By Monday, the image of the first responder quickly had become a heroic symbol of the storm and rescue efforts, featured across the web and many front pages.
The woman, Catherine Pham, and her child, little Aiden Pham — 13 months old — were rescued along with the baby’s father from their home in the city’s Meyerland section, where water reached many roofs.
Families have provided comfort for first responders. Houston Police tweeted a video showing one officer’s daughter serenading him on his birthday.
Meanwhile, from a base a thousand miles away from Houston, the 178th Wing of the Ohio Air National Guard is working from an office to make a huge impact on the ground, according to Fox 45.
Like first responders for the digital age, a team of six analysts are using maps and satellite images to help search and rescue crews find safe areas to set up command centers throughout the region — specifically looking for golf courses and parks that didn’t flood.
They’re also searching for damaged areas that need the most attention — or anything they can find to help the literal first responders in Texas.
“They are down there doing their thing,” Ohio Air National Guard Col. Rebecca O’Conner said, “and anything we can do outside of that disaster zone helps free up those people that are on the ground trying to do those rescue efforts.”
Now that skies are clearing up in Houston, crews plan to start analyzing damage from airplanes and guiding crews to the worst hit areas. The mission continues.",1
"THE EU’S INSTITUTIONS, built up over six decades, are not ideally suited to responding flexibly to challenges such as the single currency, migration or foreign and security policy. The club remains vulnerable to the charges of operating with a “democratic deficit” that alienates many voters.
Start with what is still the central institution, the European Commission. Headed by Jean-Claude Juncker, a long-time prime minister of Luxembourg, it is much more than a civil service; it is the guardian of the treaties, the originator of almost all legislation and the sole executor of the EU’s budget. By the standards of most governments it is also small, employing only around 33,000 people—about the same as a largish local council in one of the member countries (though commission staff command much more lavish salaries).
The Juncker commission has done some good things; in particular, it has sharply reduced the volume of regulation it proposes. Yet it suffers from having too many commissioners (28, one per member country), a defect that has been only partially dealt with by the creation of senior vice-presidents and junior commissioners. One consequence is that, even more than before, the commission is more or less run by Mr Juncker’s powerful cabinet under Martin Selmayr, a German official. The commission has also allowed itself to be influenced too heavily by the European Parliament, the only institution that can dismiss it, instead of acting as a balance between the Council of Ministers (representing national governments) and the parliament as the two co-legislators in the system.
Commissioners are appointed by their national governments, but are subject to confirmation by the European Parliament. The commission president is now indirectly elected under a process called Spitzenkandidaten (tellingly, a German word), introduced in 2014. Egged on by certain MEPs, the main cross-border political groups designated their preferred candidates for the job ahead of that year’s European elections. Most national governments ignored their suggestions, but when the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) emerged as the biggest political group, the European Council felt obliged to choose the EPP candidate, Mr Juncker, even though EU heads of government, including Angela Merkel and David Cameron, had serious reservations. Leaders dissatisfied with the outcome in 2014 say they are determined to ditch the Spitzenkandidaten process for the next election in 2019, but they may find it hard to put a stop to it.
By contrast, the innovation of appointing a permanent president of the European Council has proved a success. That owes something to the job’s first two incumbents, Herman Van Rompuy and Donald Tusk, former prime ministers of Belgium and Poland respectively. True, the EU now suffers from an inflation of presidents: of the European Commission, the European Council, the (rotating) Council of Ministers, the Eurogroup of finance ministers, the European Central Bank and the European Parliament, to name but six. But the increasing prominence of the European Council of heads of state and government reflects the reality that, when important decisions have to be made, it is national governments, not EU institutions, that do most of the hard bargaining. To some extent power has shifted from Brussels to national capitals.
Or rather (and there lies the rub), to one capital. The growing dominance of Berlin is a cause of anxiety not just in Brussels but in other capitals (including Berlin itself). It was perhaps inevitable during the euro crisis since Germany is, in effect, the system’s paymaster. But the habit of letting Germany, and especially Mrs Merkel, decide has increasingly taken hold across the board. Germans occupy many key posts in the commission and parliament. Brexit will make matters worse, because it will break up the trio of Britain, France and Germany that has for many years been at the heart of the European project. That will expose the contrast between French weakness and German strength even more starkly, at an awkward political moment.
Mrs Merkel is widely admired, and careful not to seem too dominant. But neither she nor a putative Chancellor Schulz can compensate for France’s inadequacies. The European project was conceived by French leaders to be headed by their country—one reason they tried hard to keep Britain out. Now their worst fears of dominance by others are being realised, not from across the Channel but from across the Rhine.
As an international bureaucracy, the EU has spawned many other bodies, some of them of dubious value. A number of them have been scattered around national capitals as sweeteners to keep the countries concerned loyal to the project. Perhaps the most preposterous pair are the Economic and Social Committee, which brings together trade union and civil representatives for monthly meetings, and the Committee of the Regions, which does the same for regional authorities. Between them these two Brussels-based bodies cost over 200m a year to run. Hardly anybody, even in Brussels, would notice if they were to disappear tomorrow.
That is not true of the EU’s main representative institution, the European Parliament. Since direct elections were introduced in 1979, its powers have been increased by every treaty, to the point where it is now largely a co-equal legislator with the Council of Ministers. At French insistence it still moves pointlessly between Brussels and Strasbourg every month, at an annual cost of some 114m. Many MEPs are impressively well-qualified and do an excellent job, often better than their national counterparts, in improving legislation and in questioning commissioners and the European Central Bank. Moreover, unlike other EU institutions, the parliament has room for anti-EU politicians. Nigel Farage, a British MEP and former leader of the UK Independence Party, memorably noted last June that when he arrived he was laughed at, but after the Brexit vote “you’re not laughing now.”
Yet as an institution seeking to bring voters closer to the European project, the parliament must still be judged a failure. It may frighten the commission, but it does not exert the sort of control over governments that national parliaments aspire to. Its link to voters is tenuous: turnout in European elections is low and falling, and voters tend to decide largely on national not European issues. Far from acting as a parliament that controls spending and curbs the executive, the European Parliament has often behaved more as a lobby group whose main aim seems to be to spend more and to augment its own powers.
One way of remedying this would be to increase the role of national parliaments. Many experienced EU officials regret the switch from a European Parliament made up of nominated national MPs to a directly elected institution, breaking the link between national and EU-level politics. National politicians in many countries remain shamefully ignorant of the EU and its rules, and too few MEPs see it as part of their role to help educate them. Indeed, many national parliaments have cast doubt on the European Parliament’s democratic credentials, as has the German constitutional court. Yet the parliament is hardly likely to vote for its own demise.
Instead, it might be used to help fill the EU’s famous democratic deficit. Most talk of such a deficit is wrong or exaggerated: EU lawmaking is in many ways more transparent than national lawmaking, and national governments usually have to approve EU laws in the Council of Ministers, although they may pretend otherwise. The place that may be suffering most from a democratic deficit is not the union as a whole but an increasingly integrated euro zone. As it penetrates more deeply into national fiscal and other domestic policies, the case for a democratically elected chamber to keep it in check is becoming stronger.
One idea would be to reconstitute the European Parliament so that it represents only the euro zone. That could become part of a new architecture which would also feature a new euro-zone finance minister as well as a euro-zone budget that would act, as in any federal system, to smooth out differences in economic performance between the constituent parts. MEPs from non-euro countries might revert to being nominated by national parliaments. That would mean much of the wider EU budget could be scrapped; most farm support has been detached from production, so it could be renationalised, and regional spending could continue within the euro zone but not in the rest of the union. Such innovations would confer greater legitimacy on the European Parliament and give it a role, but only in the central core, not the wider EU. For countries thinking of joining or quitting the euro, a euro-zone parliament might also bring home to them how momentous a step that would be.",0
"...to Zuckerberg. Sure, there is a vast difference in scale; a $4mil company as opposed to a $104bil company. But the same bullshit applies. My company had virtually no assets. We performed a miracle, according the Wall Street people, by raising half a million bucks in ""angel funding"" in six months in a podunk Western New England town. The lawyers and brokers at certain big Wall Street firms who shall go unnamed until my own lawyer clears this, said we were ""going places.""
We used our first check to rent a big booth at Art Expo in NYC, right next to Sotheby's and a couple of other big players. We bought the entire back cover of the Art Expo program, something like 50,000 copies, for cheap. Wicked cheap...because we were supposedly so hot. The first morning of the show, four guys in $5,000 suits walked up to our booth and said they wanted in. They bought in, they valued the company at $4,000,000, they used that to raise more money, they fired me from my own company, they all made fortunes, and I walked away with some worthless paper and some valuable lessons. I was about Zuckerberg's age at the time.
My point is/was -- these Wall Street fuckers, just like Mittens, they DON'T CARE. When I was fired from my own company, a la Steve Jobs at Apple, they couldn't understand why I was upset. ""It's only business,"" they told me. If you can't afford to play, don't get into the game. They ALL made fortunes, and every single principal in the company is now working on something else, with barely a dime to show for our efforts.
The lesson is simple...the people with money, like Mittens and the people who fucked me, don't care and will NOT -- WILL NOT -- help make you rich. There is no ""level playing field"" in America. If you're rich, you work to stay rich. If you're not rich, the rich will fuck you out of every good idea you ever come up with.
I hope Zuckerberg at least bought some tangible assets he can sell off after his board of directors fucks him over for a profit.
Kid, don't ever, EVER, let anyone tell you can make it America. The people that already made it will make sure you can't...they're covering their own asses. If you want to ""make it,"" become a cut throat slimy soulless asshole like they are. Like Mitt Romney is. Then at least you'll have a shot.",1
"(Before It's News)Scientists have long recognized six living species of great ape aside from humans: Sumatran and Bornean orangutans, eastern and western gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. But researchers reporting in Current Biology on November 2 have now made it seven, based on a collection of evidence showing that an isolated population of orangutans living in Sumatra is actually its own unique species. They’ve named the new species the Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis).
Unfortunately, the researchers say, there are only about 800 Tapanuli orangutans left. Those that remain are also under threat from loss of lowland habitat and hunting, which makes this newly discovered species among the most threatened great ape species in the world.
“It isn’t an everyday event that we find a new species of great ape, so indeed the discovery is very exciting,” said Michael Krutzen of the University of Zurich in Switzerland, senior author of the study. This is a photogrpah of a Pongo tapanuliensis skull.

“Great apes are among the best-studied species in the world,” added Erik Meijaard of the Australian National University. “If after 200 years of serious biological research we can still find new species in this group, what does it tell us about all the other stuff that we are overlooking: hidden species, unknown ecological relationships, critical thresholds we shouldn’t cross? Humans are conducting a vast global experiment, but we have near-zero understanding of what impacts this really has, and how it could ultimately undermine our own survival.”
The new orangutan species lives in the Batang Toru area in North Sumatra, Indonesia. While there had been rumors, no one was sure that this population of orangutans existed until 1997. They live south of what had been the known range for Sumatran orangutans.
Earlier studies suggested that the group differed from other orangutans behaviorally and at the genetic level, but it wasn’t clear that those differences were enough to support its designation as a new species. The breakthrough came in 2013, when the research team including Meijaard got access to a skeleton belonging to a Batang Toru orangutan killed in a human-animal conflict. Careful studies of the animal revealed consistent differences in its skull and teeth.

A sophisticated analysis of 37 orangutan genomes now shows that the deepest split in the evolutionary history of living orangutans occurred more than three million years ago, between the Batang Toru population and Bornean orangutans to the north of Lake Toba. Bornean and Sumatran orangutans separated only much later, less than 700,000 years ago. Behavioral and ecological evidence lends further support for the notion that the orangutans living in Batang Toru are a separate species, the researchers said.
“The Batang Toru orangutans appear to be direct descendants of the initial orangutans that had migrated from mainland Asia, and thus constitute the oldest evolutionary line within the genus Pongo,” said Alexander Nater, also of the Unversity of Zurich. “The Batang Toru population was connected to populations to the north until 10,000 or 20,000 years ago, after which it became isolated.”
The findings mean that there are now 800 fewer Sumatran orangutans than previously thought. The Tapanuli orangutans are also severely threatened by hunting and the proposed development of a hydroelectric dam that would flood large parts of their best habitat if implemented. That’s especially discouraging given that previous analyses suggest a mortality rate of less than one percent per yearwould still be enough to drive the Tapanuli orangutans extinct.

“If even 8 out of 800 animals per annum were killed or otherwise removed from the population, the species might be doomed,” the scientists caution.
The researchers say the most important thing now is to work with organizations already in the area and Indonesian government authorities to urge support for more effective conservation measures to protect the Batang Toru area. They also want to learn more about the relationship of the Tapanuli orangutan to now-extinct orangutan populations that used to live in other parts of Sumatra.

"Bernie Sanders’ older brother Larry fromOxford in England,is getting undue applause from the public for having a brother named Bernie campaigning 3,000 miles away to become the next president of the United States.
Sanders Junior happens to be setting the 2016 U. S. presidential campaign on fire with his socialist ideas and revolutionary approach.
Larry Sanders,an 80-year-old retired academic, is a campaigner for the Green Party and has recently been appointed as the party’s national spokesman on health.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is an outsider who has far exceeded expectations as he battles Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. The left-wing senator has energized thousands of young supporters with his promise to transform the American economy, education and health care systems, and last week gained more momentum by winning the New Hampshire primary.
More than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers) away, his brother, a retired academic who has lived in Britain since 1969, finds himself a “sudden celebrity.”
“I was at a meeting the other day and when I stood up to ask a question, half the people in the audience started clapping,” Larry Sanders said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I’ve been going to meetings for 40 years and no one’s ever applauded before.”
Sanders, who ran for a seat in Britain’s Parliament last year (he came fifth of seven candidates), has watched his brother’s growing success with emotions that swing from pride to disbelief.
“Sometimes it’s quite casual — ‘Oh, there he is again with 20,000 people cheering him.’ And other times I say, ‘Oh my God, look at that.'”
He says he has only recently started to believe that underdog Bernie can do it, “go all the way to the White House.”
“Really only in the last month or so did it seem to me that he was going to win the nomination,” he said. “I think once he has won the nomination he will find the general election much easier.
“I’m not entirely surprised by it, actually,” he added. “I didn’t expect it to happen quite so quickly, but I’ve seen him in action: He’s a very powerful politician. And the other thing of course is, the basis of what he’s saying is real. … There has been a shift in wealth and income from the bulk of the population to the very richest, and it goes back 40 years.”
At 80, Larry Sanders is six years older than his brother, his Brooklyn accent mellowed by more than four decades in Britain.
He says the brothers’ politics are rooted in the post-war Brooklyn where they grew up, the children of “staunch New Dealer” parents. Their father, Eli, was a Polish Jew who came to the United States when he was 17, their mother Dorothy the New York-born child of eastern European Jewish immigrants.
“We were not poor — we had everything we needed — but our parents argued, and what they argued about was money,”Sanders said in the kitchen of his modest, century-old house not far from Oxford’s historic city center.
“I think a lot of politicians, if they’ve come from financially secure backgrounds, it doesn’t really resonate what it means to have these arguments and to have this tension. And Bernard, without wanting to have it, has it, and it hasn’t gone away.”
To Sanders, his brother is always Bernard, never Bernie, which just doesn’t “sound right.”
Sanders said that growing up, the brothers were conscious of the shadow of the Holocaust, “because we knew we’d lost relatives, and the consequence of that was that politics was very serious. Lots of kids grow up thinking it’s just game-playing.”",1
"NEW YORK - Equifax (EFX) has taken down one of its web pages after reports that another part of its web site had been hacked as well.
The news comes as Equifax continues to deal with the aftermath of hackers breaking into its system earlier this year which allowed the personal information of 145.5 million Americans to be accessed or stolen.
Hackers reportedly altered Equifax's credit report assistance page that would send users malicious software pretending to be Adobe Flash.
Equifax said that, out of an abundance of caution, the Atlanta company has taken the affected page offline, and it's looking into the matter.
A slew of federal agencies and state prosecutors are investigating Equifax. The company's former CEO, who left the company in the aftermath of the data breach, admitted to lawmakers earlier this month that a combination of human and technology failures enabled the cyberattack.
""This new announcement from Equifax is just Reason No. 10,000 why consumers should assume their personal information is already out there and act accordingly,"" said Matt Schulz, CreditCards.com's senior industry analyst. ""It's a scary thing to wrap your brain around, but the truth is that you're better off assuming the worst and taking steps to protect yourself.""
After its systems were penetrated, Equifax pointed to a flawed web server gateway called Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638.
Jeff Williams, co-founder of Contrast Security, linked the latest hack to third-party software used by Equifax called Fireclick. ""Basically, a very similar problem with two quite different pieces of code,"" he said.
""Anyone using the Fireclick library may have been affected, and the attackers may not even know that they compromised Equifax,"" Williams added.",0
"With polls consistently showing that approximately 50% of Canadians and Americans doubt the official story of 9/11, the feat of keeping the lid on a public debate for over 12 years has been nothing short of miraculous.
This article presents a simple case study showing that this miracle is being performed with the assistance of Google and YouTube search engine interference
On September 8, 2013, the popular Russia Today “Truthseeker” program, with over a million subscribers on YouTube,[1] published a 13-minute newscast entitled “The Truthseeker: 9/11 and Operation Gladio (E23).”
Below the video frame ran the caption:
Bigger than Watergate’: US ‘regular’ meetings with Al-Qaeda’s leader; documented White House ‘false flag terrorism’ moving people ‘like sheep’; the father of Twin Towers victim tell us why he backs this month’s 9/11 campaign on Times Square and around the world; & the protests calendar for September.
This paragraph was followed by a list of interviewees, including four people representing three scholarly research organizations: Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth,[2] the 9/11 Consensus Panel,[3] and The Journal of 9/11 Studies.[4]
The “Truthseeker” video immediately started to gain popularity on YouTube, reaching 131,000 views in the first three days.[5](The history of the viewing statistics may be seen by clicking on the little graphic symbol under the video frame, and to the right)
Truthseeker posted its program to YouTube on Sept. 8. Russia Today tweeted the YouTube link to its 546,000 followers and to the interviewer, Daniel Bushell, that day:
A MOXNEWS copy of the same newscast was also posted September 8 under the title “Russia Today News Declares 9/11 An Inside Job False Flag Attack!” which in turn started to escalate, with over 80,000 views in the first few days.[6]
Other uploads of the program also appeared, with less traffic, bringing the early viewing total to over a quarter of a million people.
In both the RT and MOXNEWS cases, the viewer statistics on YouTube suddenly flat-lined on the morning of September 11 — like a heart monitor when a patient dies.
The YouTube search engine had suddenly failed to locate these videos.
Oddly, although the RT video may still be viewed on YouTube through its direct link (if known) from the Google URL box,[7] it cannot be accessed on YouTube by its title, or by portions of its title, or by searching “Truthseeker.”
The MOXNET version was also decoupled from the YouTube search engine for a period of time after September 11, but has since been restored to normal indexing.
Below is RT’s “Truthseeker” “9/11 and Operation Gladio” reposted on GlobalResearchTV:
How Were the Search Engine Failures Detected and Verified?
Investigations carried out independently by a US engineering colleague and myself revealed the following:
· Searching the exact title of the original “Truthseeker” posting (“9/11 and Operation Gladio”) does not yield the original RT post. It does yield other posts with far fewer viewings, but the original, which as we have seen still exists as a URL, is evidently no longer in the YouTube index.
Its viewings have slowly risen over several weeks from 131,000 to 136,000 through the early news reports — but with by far the most views of all the uploads, it should appear at the top of the list.
* Searching YouTube for the URL of the original escalating RT version produces no result either, although as we have seen, the URL is still a functioning direct link. (Experiment: Take any URL from YouTube or Google, plug it into the search box and watch it come up on top of the list — because there is only one.)
* Searching YouTube for the program’s name, “Truthseeker,” displays titles from Episodes 1-22, and also Episode 24, but it fails to show Episode 23, “9/11 and Operation Gladio” in 15 pages of search results.
* Searching for the MOXNET post on the third day of its existence (September 11) produced a similar result. It should have appeared second from the top with its 80,000 views, but it was difficult to get it to appear at all — except through its direct link (if one had saved this earlier).
* Oddly enough, the MOXNET post is once again normally accessible on YouTube (as it was September 8-11) through a search of either: a) its full title, or b) its first few words.
An exploration of the Google Web and Google Video search results revealed the following about access to the RT “Truthseeker” Episode 23:
· Google Web Rankings: On a search of “9/11 and Operation Gladio,” Google Web first brought up several news items, followed by an array of low-volume YouTube uploads that did not include the popular original RT version.
· Google Video Rankings: On the same search, “9/11 and Operation Gladio,” Google Video first listed the “Truthseeker” website page from which the video may also be watched and downloaded (as discussed below). This was followed by a half dozen uploads from other sources, mostly showing 50-200 video views. The original RT video that is still available by direct link and now records 136,000 views, did not show up at all — yet it should have been on top.
· On both Google Web and Google Video, searching the original RT URL failed to bring up the early version of the program that had started to go viral[8] — although its direct link still exists and shows up on several early September news websites.
The “Truthseeker” produces a new show every two weeks. As of this writing, the “Truthseeker” home page shows Episode 24, dated September 22, right at the top, followed by Episodes 22, 21, 20, and 19.
Our case-study Episode 23, dated September 8, was displayed at the top of the home page from September 8-11, before it disappeared.
It was then located under a different date — August 1, 2012 — buried on a back page with earlier episodes from over a year ago.
This may have been a simple mistake on the part of a large investigative news network that is attracting personnel and audiences away from Western networks, or it may be the result of hacking or political pressure. [It should be noted that when a September 8 2013 posting is given a new date namely August 1, 2012, it no longer appears on Google News in the days leading up to and following September 11, 2013, the date of commemoration of the 9/11 attacks. This redating of the September 8 posting also affects its ranking in the search engines, GR Ed.].
The bottom line is that at least with regard to the Google and YouTube (which is owned by Google) search engines, something highly unusual has gone awry.[9]
Failure of Email Transmissions Describing the Above Investigation
Perhaps the most disturbing element of this case study is that for more than two weeks after September 11, 2013, it was impossible for some people to transmit by email the link to the original YouTube Episode 23 that had started to go viral.[10]
An email containing this link would at first appear to have transmitted normally, for it would show up in the sender’s Sent Mail. But it would not be received by the addressees — including the sender, if copied to self.
To my knowledge, at least six people, including three IT professionals, experienced the failure of email transmissions containing this particular link.
Of these IT professionals, one concluded, “There is no benign explanation for this.”
When videos start to become popular on YouTube, the statistics curve usually continues to rise over time.
Some show an initial burst of interest, with the curve rising quite steeply, then settling into an upward sloping line over time. This may be seen with the 2011 “Ultimate Dog Tease” (145 million).[11]
Others have a slower start, then catch on and build steadily, as did the 2012 “Psy-GangnamStyle” video, the first to be viewed over a billion times.[12]
The same slow-start pattern was seen with the 2007 video, “9/11 Clues EVERYONE MISSED.”[13]
Now compare these graphs with the two flat-line interruptions in the case-study videos whose progress was truncated by search engine failure.[14]
The point is that if a particular video is catching on, and people can see the excitement and enthusiasm for it right there in the viewer stats, they are apt to jump aboard and watch it. They are far less likely to watch a video with 50-200 views that has been rated “ho hum” by the viewing public.
Those who covertly study the impact of “inconvenient” political broadcasts, and who take note and interfere with them, understand these things.
2. The significance of this interference:
The suppression of free political communication in our society has grave consequences for several reasons:
* It is clear that that there is not just spying and data collection going on. There is also electronic interference in our media, search engines, and mailboxes that is suppressing freedom of expression at various levels;
* Media and search engine suppression can be held up for public view, while evidence of individual email tampering, probably carried out by covert state agencies, is frightening. People are naturally reluctant to report it or write about it — for there is no one to report it to;
* In the case of 9/11, which has torn the fabric of humanity down the middle — between Muslims and Christians, and between East and West — it is essential that the evidence backing this event be absolutely correct and open to question at all times;
* The fact that the lid on 9/11 has been nailed down so firmly for so long creates great suspicion that this case study points to possible obstruction of free information transfer by government agencies recently identified through NSA whistleblowers Edward Snowden, William Binnie, Thomas Drake, and others.
This essay is offered to all citizens who believe the government should be investigated when state crimes against democracy are suspected.
It is further offered to all who pay taxes for government care, protection, and the guarantee of constitutional freedoms — and in particular to citizens who may have encountered chilling indications of covert state interference in their lives.",1

U. K. Prime Minister Theresa May will go into the political battle of a lifetime with the smallest army of civil servants since the 1940s, forcing her into a talent drive to deliver Brexit.
With fewer than 400,000 mandarins on hand, the British state needs to divorce from the European Union and forge a new trading relationship with its biggest market. It must also strike commercial deals with other nations, transpose European laws into British ones and create new regulatory bodies and systems for policing immigration and managing customs. And that is just for starters.

Such demands on top of the day-to-day requirements of keeping the nation safe, collecting taxes and providing healthcare leave the nation’s top civil servant, Jeremy Heywood, acknowledging that “the challenge of Brexit has few, if any, parallels in its complexity.”
The question is whether a bureaucracy shrunk by fiscal austerity can rise to the challenge as May this week triggers two years of talks with her 27 European counterparts in no mood to make life easy for a country that chose to leave them behind.
“The reality is that this can’t possibly be done in two years because it’s such a vast undertaking,” said Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at the University of Cambridge. “As the government turns over each individual stone, they realize that there are quite a lot of stones underneath and none of them can be dealt with very easily.”
The risk of failure was underscored last week when the National Audit Office calculated there are 26 percent fewer civil servants than a decade ago, and that more than a fifth of senior posts advertised last year remain unfilled. A leaked memo by consultancy Deloitte LLP at the end of last year estimated 30,000 new civil servants were needed to cope with the workload.
Those who have been recruited often came at a cost to other areas. Brexit Secretary David Davis’s department poached most of its 328 people from other ministries and theTrade Ministry transferred in all but 41 of its 1,258 officials from elsewhere in the government.
“The government is reducing staff numbers and increasing workloads,” said Rob O’Neill, Assistant General Secretary of the FDA union of senior civil servants. “What is the inevitable impact of that?”
The kind of expertise needed has the government willing to pay 160,000 pounds ($201,000) to whoever it hires as its top international trade negotiator. That is more than May earns.
What’s more, the U. K. hasn’t negotiated a deal alone since it joined the bloc in 1973 and now must strike one not only with the EU, but in time, with the likes of China and the U.S., giant economies with plenty of experience. That might put the British at a disadvantage.
“The EU machine has done this lots and knows how to do these negotiations,” said Joseph Owen, a researcher at the Institute for Government. “The U. K. has never really gone into much detail on these things. It’s never carried a free-trade agreement in its entirety from beginning to end.”
There are also domestic details to sort out. As many as 15 bills will be needed to cover different aspects of Brexit, eating up a big chunk of the typical menu of 20 or so bills announced every year, according to the London-based IfG.
The government will this week outline its plans for a “Great Repeal Bill,” the main purpose of which is to convert EU law into British law, to ensure continuity in the months after Brexit.
The House of Commons Library estimated earlier in the year that there are 898 directives and 5,155 regulations among more than 19,000 rules that will need to be imported.
Among them: a series of EU programs the U. K. will be under pressure to design their own versions of or try to persuade the EU to let it remain in. Examples include Euratom, which governs nuclear cooperation, Erasmus, and the European Medicine Agency, which approves drugs.
All told, Cambridge’s Barnard estimates EU laws reference anything between 50 and 100 different authorities.
“That will require very detailed work thinking about exactly what jurisdictions, what powers these agencies have got,” Barnard said. “These are all big issues, and they’re also very time-consuming.”
Complicating the Brexit process even further is that budget cuts have sapped the civil service of strength when it needs it most.
The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs is affected by 1,200 EU laws and distributes 3 billion pounds of EU money every year. Yet it has lost a third of its staff since 2010, according to the IfG.
The Home Office has lost a fifth of its operational budget at a time it needs to develop new tools to control immigration. The Migration Observatory in Oxford estimates that if all EU citizens currently living in the country applied for permanent residence, it would represent 140 years of work at current turnover rates.
Then there is the fact that the country won’t run itself as Brexit drags on. May’s Conservatives have manifesto commitments to meet and tackle fresh headaches such as another bid for Scottish independence.
“The future of the nation is at stake here,”said the FDA’s O’Neill. “The government needs to provide sufficient resources to ensure that departments are fully staffed and fully equipped in order to be able to deliver a successful Brexit for the nation. If it’s not going to do that, something’s got to give.""",0
"On the evening of 1 October 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the Route 91 Harvest music festival at an open lot directly across from the Luxor Hotel and Casino, and obliquely across from the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on one side and the Excalibur Hotel on the other.
The official government narrative, immediately parroted by both the mainstream media and Wikipedia, is clearly false. They claim that a single old man, Steven Paddock, a multi-millionaire with a great deal to live for, kicked out the plate glass windows of his hotel room and fired enough rounds from a variety of weapons to allegedly kill 59 and wound 489.
This is nonsense. Here is what the official narrative is not disclosing:
1) The Mandalay Hotel has special weapons detectors installed and would never have allowed weapons in unless they were cooperating with either a real federal law enforcement team or a fake law enforcement team (e.g. a Mossad team with impeccable credentials).
2) A Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) exercise or drill was taking place across the entire city at the time, with many “crisis actors” hired and integrated into the crowd watching the Route 91 music festival.
3) There was no Emergency Response Team (EMT) of note over the course of many hours – neither for the drill nor for the real dead and wounded. Many more may have died for lack of a proper response caused by confusion and compounded by treason in high places.
In the several days since the horrific events occurred, a number of sources have come forward and we now speculate that the following may be true:
1) Steven Paddock was a patsy, gambling until fifteen minutes before the shooting. He had neither the time, strength, training, nor capacity to shoot any number of weapons into a group over 1,000 meters away, nor were the casings for 2,000 or so rounds fired, present in the room. While he may have thought he was part of a federal sting operation against Islamic State of Syria and Iraq (ISIS), he is not the perpetrator.
2) There were clearly multiple shooters, including at least one with an M-60 belt-fed machine gun, and at least one shooter appears to have used hollow-nosed bullets that fragment and cause massive damage to those they hit.
3) A great deal of the early “evidence” was a mix of material coming out from the pre-planned drill and the crisis actors playing out their roles and therefore discernably false; and isolated truthful material sharply in conflict with the government narrative and quickly deleted by #GoogleGestapo.
There are five potential perpetrators of this mass atrocity, in order of probability (in the view of an authorBY ROBERT DAVID STEELE), with the clear possibility of there being alliances among them as there was in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
1) Zio-Cons – US citizens – loyal to Israel. The event is intended to punish Donald Trump for not invading Syria and not supporting the Greater Israel plan;
2) Zio-Cons – US citizens – loyal to money. Sheldon Adelson and Michael Chertoff are explicitly named by multiple sources as having massive equities in a major budget expansion and new laws following from this massacre, such that they reap tens of billions of dollars in the sale of metal detectors, gun-ranging towers, and intrusive security services including the Superbowl;
3) Zio-Cons – US citizens – with Satanic blood sacrifice occult interests, now in deep fear of both President Donald Trump’s attempts to drain the swamp (including his strong campaign to arrest pedophiles) and the emergence of populism from the left (Sanders) and right (Trump) to the international arena (Scotland, Catalonia).
4) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) – the perennial favorite among the conspiracy theorists; others are saying the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was the lead for the patsy and US military special operations did the shooting – I don’t agree.
5) The Russian Mafia, in retaliation for the destruction across the USA of a major Russian criminal network, with the Department of Justice charging 33 defendants with a variety of racketeering, fraud, narcotics, firearms, and stolen property offenses.A possible deal between Israel and Russia, accepting Russia as the new balancer of power in the Middle East, is on the margins of this analysis.
While I have no direct knowledge, from my position as a former spy who has gone on to found the Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) discipline world-wide, and who reads widely, I believe that the US Government (USG) did not knowingly plan or execute this massacre BUT that Zio-Cons in official positions across CIA, FBI, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and FEMA – in charge of the drill – actively committed treason in support of this massacre.
I suspect that the FBI does have some useful perspectives on who they should be questioning, and I also believe that they are being prevented from going after the top Zio-Cons who should be questioned both intensively, and with the use of polygraphs and if necessary truth-serum.
For those who doubt that the USG might allow the perpetrators of this horrific event to not only escape but to then go on to profit by selling billions of dollars in unneeded security services and equipment, I have four prior examples of when we have done precisely that:
* The assassination of John F. Kennedy by a CIA team with the hearty support of both the FBI and Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, present in Dallas as the official observer for Israel;
* The assassination of Martin Luther King by an Army sniper on detail to the FBI;
* USS Liberty, strafed and torpedoed by the Israelis, with a deliberate long-running cover-up by the USG led by Lyndon Baines Johnson;
* 9/11, planned by Israel, logistically supported by Saudi Arabia, and executed by a mixed team overseen by Dick Cheney who was subsequently protected by the FBI.
In my view, this tragedy is also an opportunity. Let me spell it out more simply: even if this was an official government massacre using actual CIA and FBI employees in support of a Top Secret “compartmented” massacre on top of an unclassified FEMA drill, the President – and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the new Director of the FBI – have an opportunity to investigate, illuminate, indict, and incarcerate. Should they do so, and a billionaire do visible “hard time,” it will change America for the better and begin the difficult task of restoring the legitimacy of the federal government in the eyes of the public.",1
"They have done a lot more for people than the Government has. You see, they did what the Government couldn’t or didn’t want to do: They redistributed the wealth from their ‘rich’ customer to the lowest-earning ones.
It all started when they asked for $15 from their customers so they could buy theU. S-Mexican border. They were calling it‘Cards Against Humanity Saves America.’ It turns out; they are trying to save America in more ways than one.
So that is why they sent $1000 checks to the 100 of their lowest earning customers and gave the $15 full refund to the next 10,000 people. Where did this money come from, you ask? Well, from the donation their highest earning customers made.

"John McCain has not been a favorite of the conservatives. That’s probably why his presidential campaign crumbled in 2008. Which lead him to put the remaining money he had into a foundation that “is dedicated to advancing human rights, dignity, democracy and freedom.” The Daily Caller found out the disturbing information that McCain’s foundation is funded by George Soros!
The institute has accepted contributions of as much as $100,000 from billionaire liberal activist-funder George Soros and from Teneo, a for-profit company co-founded by Doug Band, former President Bill Clinton’s “bag man.” Teneo has long helped enrich Clinton through lucrative speaking and business deals.
And Bloomberg reported in 2016 on a $1 million Saudi Arabian donation to the institute, a contribution the McCain group has refused to explain publicly.
In addition, the institute has taken at least $100,000 from a Moroccan state-run company tied to repeated charges of worker abuse and exploitation. The McCain group has also accepted at least $100,000 from the Pivotal Foundation, which was created by Francis Najafi who owns the Pivotal Group, a private equity and real estate firm.

"Let’s face it, your wedding dress is taking up coveted closet space and, decades from now, your daughter is not likely to wear what’s sure to be an out-of-style gown. So, why not declutter? Sell it and let some lucky bride get a deal on her dress. Here are a few websites that will resell a gown, and some examples of gowns being offered at markedly reduced prices. We’ve also listed some places that take dresses as donations for brides in need.
In 2010, Bruno and Ingrid Szajer, then newly married, startedStillwhite.com, where brides can sell their already-worn wedding dresses. They started because she tried to stuff a big box containing her wedding dress under the bed in their one-bedroom apartment in Sydney, Australia. “And how long do you expect to keep it there?” he asked. When she said “forever,” he decided to start a business. Hers was the first one they posted on the site. Mr. Szajer said that the site had 250,000 visitors each month and that dresses were sold worldwide. Some dresses sell in minutes, though the usual sell time is 60 to 90 days. There is a listing fee of $20 or $30, depending on thetype of packageyou want, and the rest is up to the seller and the buyer to negotiate and ship.
Jacqueline Courtney started her site,Nearlynewlywed.com, in 2012, a year after being married in her dream gown, which was designed by Vera Wang. Ms. Courtney had bought her gown secondhand for $4,500 ($7,000 retail) from a woman in Atlanta. “It popped up on eBay,” she said. “My mother flew to Atlanta where she arranged to meet the woman, and the dress, in the airport.” After her wedding, with little extra space in her Brooklyn apartment and feeling that someone else could also feel happy in the dress, she resold it for $4,000 to a woman in Manhattan. That inspired her to make it easier for brides to buy a previously worn dress. Her site charges a $25 listing fee, supplies a shipping label for the seller to send the dress and then takes care of customer services. It keeps the dress in inventory, and does all of the work surrounding the sale and all of the correspondence between the buyer and the seller, as well as the shipping once sold. Dresses are repacked and sent in a fresh garment bag and box. The commission is 35 percent, and dresses may be returned within five days if the buyer is unhappy.
TheRealReal.comwas started in 2011 in San Francisco. After an online form is filled out and the Real Real accepts the garment, the seller receives a paid shipping label and sends the dress to the company (or a representative will pick it up). Once the dress is received, the company takes it from there. The seller receives a check when the dress is sold. This is a luxury consignment site and the commission is 55 percent to 70 percent. Natalie Seufferlein, a senior manager, said the site had sold four million items (not all bridal) in six years.
Josie Daga is the founder and owner ofPreownedWeddingDresses.com, a site she started in 2004 when she wanted to sell her wedding dress after divorcing. She said many women did not know what style dress they wanted when they began their search. Her site, she said, makes it easy to look at many styles, from romantic to sexy. “It used to be that girls looked through magazines when they got engaged,” she said. “Now they come to our site.” Dresses are priced from $50 to $50,000, and many cost less than $500. A seller pays a listing fee of $25, then it’s up to the buyer and seller to make a deal.
Tradesy.comstarted as a bridal consignment site, but now resells other clothing as well. This site does not charge a listing fee but takes a 14.9 percent commission on sales. The site has a price recommendation function and all sales are final.
Many know that other brides-to-be cannot afford a designer wedding dress and are happy to donate theirs in exchange for a tax deduction.
Fairytalebrides.orgruns a resale shop in Maryland and donates the net proceeds to charities. All workers there are volunteers. A dress may be sent by mail for those out of the area. BridesAcrossAmerica.comalso accepts donated gowns to give to military brides in need. Housing Works in New York has a once-a-year event called Bride on a Buck at one of its area thrift shops. Information for how to donate for next year’s sale and auction can be found athousingworks.org.",0
"It’s scary to think that for eight years, right in the midst of the West’s deadly global fight against radical Islamic terrorist organizations such as ISIS, we had as our President a person from a Muslim family in Kenya.
It should come as no surprise, then, that we had such a dramatic spike in domestic terrorism during Obama’s tenure in the White House. Reporter Maria Bartiromo recently uncovered a spy ring of three Muslim brothers who were working for Obama’s Democrats in Congress.
Said Maria,“These three Muslims were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people’s computer networks unauthorized. At a minimum they were fired.”
She continued, “At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence, foreign affairs and intelligence committees…. they were getting very important information, government information. They accessed these computers.”
Asked Maria, “How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers…just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one? They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old…one of the guys, the other was 25. They’re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background!”

"China launched its first domestically built aircraft carrier, burnishing President Xi Jinping’s credentials as commander-in-chief ahead of a Communist Party leadership reshuffle this year.
The warship was floated at a shipyard in the northeastern port of Dalian in a ceremony attended by General Fan Changlong, second only to Xi on the Central Military Commission, according to a statement on the Ministry of National Defense’s website. A bottle of champagne was ceremonially smashed on the vessel’s bow before the ship was escorted from dry dock, the ministry said.
The aircraft carrier program lies at the heart of China’s effort to build a “blue water” navy capable of projecting power beyond the country’s coast and protecting increasingly far-flung interests. Xi has made overhauling and modernizing the People’s Liberation Army a centerpiece of his agendasince taking power in 2012.
The aircraft carrier -- the second in an estimated fleet of as many as six such ships -- was based on the design of the Liaoning, a Soviet vessel China bought from Ukraine, refitted and put to sea almost six years ago. Launching the carrier allows Xi to tout an historic milestone before he presides over the ruling party’s twice-a-decade congress, in which roughly half of its Central Committee is expected to be replaced.
“China has this ambitious goal of acquiring more aircraft carriers,” said Andrew Scobell, a senior political scientist at RAND Corp. who has written about China’s aircraft carrier program for the U. S. Naval War College Review. “The program has different drivers, but the one that cannot be discounted is prestige and status for Chinese leaders.”
The new carrier, known for now as Type 001A, is being built by the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corp. Construction of a third is already underway by China State Shipbuilding Corp. at the Jiangnan shipyard near Shanghai. Defense analysts at military-affliated research groups have told state media that the country needs at least three more.
“Launching is a key juncture of aircraft-carrier building and marks a significant achievement for our country’s home-built and designedcarrier,” the defense ministry said. The carrier, which state media say would probably be named after the coastal province of Shandong, still requires years of fitting, testing and sea trials.
China Shipbuilding Industry Co.,the Type 001A builder’s listed unit, fell 4.5 percent in Shanghai trading Wednesday, the most since December. On Tuesday, the company reported full-year profit of 698 million yuan ($101 million), compared with analysts’ estimates of 663 million yuan.
The launch came as the region’s long-dominant naval power, the U. S., deployed a strike group led by the nuclear-powered USS Carl Vinson to the Western Pacific in response to tensions around North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. China’s first two carriers -- limited by their ski-jump decks, diesel propulsion systems and limited overseas bases -- pose little challenge to the U.S.’s supercarriers.
While Liaoning’s political commissar in November declared the carrier “combat ready,” the PLA Navy has largely used it for training. The carriers were expected to be limited to forays beyond the so-called First Island Chain, Scobell said, using the term for the string of archipelagos that stretches from Japan, past Taiwan to the Philippines -- all U. S. security partners.
The new carrier has more advanced weapons systems than the Liaoning,said Ni Lexiong, director of theShanghai University of Political Science and Law’s Sea Power and Defense Policy Research Institute. The ship will accommodate more J-15 fighter jets, carry China’s most advanced S-band radar and feature four batteries of HQ-10 short-range air-defense missiles, Ni said.
“It signals the PLAN’s growing capabilities, which were achieved at a fast pace,” Ni said.
The Liaoning displaces a maximum of about 60,000 tons. The Japan-based USS Ronald Reagan, by comparison, displaces 97,000 tons while the Carl Vinson displaces about 103,000 tons.
The first two Chinese carriers are hampered by the lack of steam catapult launching systems used by the U. S., according toRichard Bitzinger, coordinator of the military transformations program at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. That means the J-15s must carry more fuel and limit ordnance loads. China may attempt to install a steam catapult system on its third carrier.
Scobell said it might be decades before China possesses multiple large aircraft carriers and becomes adept at operating them. By then, more sophisticated “carrier-killer” missiles and othernew systems to deny them access to certain waters may make them less relevant.
“Some of my colleagues in Washington say: China, build all the carriers you want,” Scobell said. “It’s going to spend a lot of money, a lot of effort, but to what end?”",0
"HONG KONG and Macau have much in common. Just 60km apart across the Pearl River delta (and soon to be linked by a bridge), they were both European colonies before being returned to China. Britain handed over Hong Kong in 1997; Portugal handed over Macau two years later. Both are administered under the “one country, two systems? principle, which allows them to retain their systems of government for 50 years. Yet whereas many Hong Kongers agitate loudly and relentlessly for more democracy, the people of Macau appear less concerned. Why is this?
Wealth may be part of the answer. Macau is the only part of China where gambling in casinos is legal. In one generation the city has become the world’s largest gambling centre, with the casino industry bringing an abundance of well-paid jobs. GDP per person in 2016 was 554,619 patacas ($73,187), among the highest in the world and 68% higher than in Hong Kong. Wages are supplemented by the government, which gives each resident 9,000 patacas every year. Chinese officials regard Macau as a political model for what Hong Kong should be: compliant with the Communist Party’s wishes and unequivocally patriotic. Loyalty is drilled into people by the media and in schools. A security law, known as Article 23, wielded in the name of punishing treason and secessionism, keeps citizens wary. In Hong Kong, opposition to “patriotic? education and to Article 23 forced the local government to shelve both.
In August Macau’s government asked China’s army for help with clearing up the destruction left by Typhoon Hato, the strongest storm in 50 years. This entailed the first deployment of troops on the streets since the handover in 1999. Were they to be mobilised in Hong Kong, even in a humanitarian role, some people would worry. In Macau, the soldiers’ presence was cheered. The Communist Party’s sway over the territory’s politics predates the end of Portuguese rule. In the 1960s the Cultural Revolution spilled over from the mainland, triggering pro-Communist riots in Macau. Similar unrest in Hong Kong was curbed by the British, but in Macau the party’s influence spread through civil society. By the time of the handover negotiations in the 1980s, China had already turned down two Portuguese efforts to give it back. Unlike Hong Kong, to which China promised the eventual introduction of “universal suffrage? in elections for the territory’s leadership, Macau received no such pledge.
While many in Macau appear content, there are still grumbles. Residents complain about the cost of buying a home, a shortage of social housing and the state of public transport and hospitals. Casinos create jobs with long, unsociable hours, and clog the city with tourist buses. Critics have been particularly vocal about the government’s response to Hato, in which ten people died and 200 were injured. Opposition parties hope that citizens will remember their anger at the ballot box on September 17th, when 150,000 locals will elect 14 members of the 33-seat Legislative Assembly. The rest of the legislators are picked by labour unions and other government-approved interest groups, or appointed by the territory’s chief executive, Fernando Chui. In 2013 the opposition won less than a quarter of the vote, and less than two-thirds of that went to candidates calling for greater democracy. At an equivalent election in 2016 in Hong Kong, pro-democracy candidates won more than half of the directly elected seats.

Rates of Guillain-Barré syndrome — a rare, paralyzing side-effect of some infections — nearly tripled, the researchers said. And rates of other inflammatory conditions such as encephalitis doubled in the northeastern part of Brazil that was hardest hit by Zika.
Separately, the World Health Organization tweaked its statement on Zika and the rise in rates of birth defects and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), saying the virus is the “most likely explanation” for both.
For their report, the team at Brazil’s Oswaldo Cruz Foundation looked at rates of birth defects, GBS and nervous system inflammatory conditions before and after the arrival of Zika virus.

“Beginning in mid-2014, we observed an unprecedented and significant rise in the hospitalization rate for congenital malformations of the nervous system, Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalitis, myelitis, and encephalomyelitis,” the organization explained in the report, which was published in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.
“We found increases in the number of hospitalizations for congenital malformations of the nervous system, GBS, and some inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system. These complications began to cause more hospitalizations, with strong fluctuations over the course of the study period, beginning even before the first warning in November 2015 about the possible effects of infection with Zika virus on microcephaly and other malformations.”
Zika has swept across much of Latin America and the Caribbean, and there’s no doubt that it can cause birth defects that permanently damage the brain and cause miscarriages. The virus invades brain and nervous system tissue, with catastrophic effects in a developing fetus.
Like other infections, it can also cause Guillain-Barré, which causes usually temporary paralysis, and on very rare occasions, other inflammations of the nervous system.
Zika’s also arrived in south Florida, infecting at least 56 people locally. Thousands of travelers have carried the virus to the U. S.

It’s spread mostly by mosquitos but also through sex.
Christovam Barcellos and colleagues in Brazil looked at data from Brazil’s hard-hit northeastern region. Before 2014, about 40 out of every 100,000 babies born there had birth defects affecting their nervous systems, including their brains.
After Zika’s arrival, this rate quadrupled to 170 per 100,000 births. By February of this year, the rate of such birth defects across Brazil had doubled, the team reported.
“In the Northeast region, the hospitalization rate for GBS was 0.05 per 100,000 residents until May 2015, when an outbreak occurred, which peaked in July 2015,” they wrote.
“From June 2015 through February 2016, the hospitalization rate was 0.11 per 100,000 residents, an increase by a factor of 2.7.”
There was a similar increase in rarer nervous system conditions, including encephalitis, myelitis, and encephalomyelitis, the team found. These are inflammations of the brain and spinal cord that can be deadly.
The researchers say it’s possible that other factors help Zika cause such devastating effects, including other infections such as Zika’s cousins dengue virus and chikungunya virus, which were also circulating in Brazil’s northeast.
“The region had one of the worst droughts in its history, during 2010–2013, resulting in contamination of drinking water, food insecurity, and outbreaks of diarrhea across the region, which could have affected the immunity status of the population,” they wrote.
WHO’s expert panel on Zika said it’s worth at least ruling out this possibility.
“The expert panel recognizes that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or GBS. It is not known whether these effects depend on as yet uncharacterized co-factors being present. Nor is it known whether dengue virus plays a part; dengue virus is carried by the same species of mosquito and has circulated in many countries during the same period,” WHO said in the statement posted Wednesday.
But WHO also said Zika at the very least plays an important role in causing GBS and birth defects.
“The most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including microcephaly,” it said.
“The most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome in whole populations is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome.”",0

"401(k) and IRA retirementplan benefits will remain the same under a new tax proposal released today by House Republicans.
""The 401(k)s and IRAs stay as they are,"" Ways and Means chairmanKevin Brady, R-Texas, told reporters in a briefing.
The big newsfor Americans saving for retirement is that lawmakers opted not to slash the amount of pre-tax money 401(k) investors can put into their plans, a decision that keeps intact a key tax shelter for Main Street workers and a powerful incentive for them to save more.
401(k) plans have become the primary retirement savings vehiclefor a growing number of Americans in an age where traditional pensions paid by employers are being phased out or eliminated. In a 401(k), plan participantsuse their own money to save for their Golden Years, as opposed to old-styled pensions that arefunded by employers.
Under the House proposal unveiled Thursday, Americans 50 or younger will still be able to set aside as much as $18,500 of their salariesinto their 401(k) accounts -- the updated IRS maximum for 2018 -- before their income tax is calculated.Americans 50 or older will be able to sock away $24,500 in their 401(k)s next year with pre-tax dollarsunder the new GOP plan.
There had been talk of the maximum pre-tax 401(k) limit being slashed to $2,400 -- which was viewed by many financial expertsas a negative savings incentive for Americans trying to save for retirement.
Last month, President Trump tried to squash fears of a changes to 401(k)s in a tweet: ""There will be NO change to your 401(k),"" the presidenttweeted. ""This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!""
A group that represents fund providers lauded today'sproposalto keep the tax-deferred retirement savings vehicles intact.
""The bill recognizes the important role that current retirement savings tax incentives play in helping Americans prepare for retirement,"" Paul Schott Stevens, president and CEO of the Investment Company Institute, a fund trade group, said in a statement.
Tax plan caps property deduction at $10,000, puts new limit on mortgage deduction
The annual savings limit on IRAs, or individual retirement accounts, will also remain unchanged at $5,500 for next year, with savers 50 and older able to save an additional $1,000.

"Cuando la discusión se vuelve acalorada en el seminario de posgrado de Andrea Cote-Botero, se alcanzan a escuchar tanto inglés como espaol, tal como suele suceder en el flujo en la cercana frontera de Ciudad Juárez. En el único programa bilingüe de maestría en creación literaria en Estados Unidos, en la Universidad de Texas en El Paso, este día le toca a los estudiantes comparar cómo F. Scott Fitzgerald y Gabriel García Márquez presentan las ciudades de West Egg y Macondo, los respectivos entornos de sus novelas clásicas.
Muchos de los alumnos sentados alrededor de la mesa comentan en espaol y a veces cambian al inglés para resaltar algo a los hablantes nativos de esa lengua. Cote-Botero está pendiente y de vez en cuando interrumpe en cualquiera de los dos idiomas. Un estudiante de Ciudad de México consulta con otro de Las Vegas un pasaje de The Great Gatsby, de Fitzgerald, y en ocasiones voltea a ver su computadora, donde tiene abierto Google Translate.
Este programa de maestría en El Paso, que comenzó en 2006, atrae sobre todo a residentes locales de ambos lados de la frontera. El espaol es la lengua materna de doce de los veinte alumnos y todos hablan por lo menos un poco de espaol e inglés. Los motiva el deseo de escribir y leer en otra lengua y de estudiar con profesores versados en otras culturas. Una alumna, una texana de ascendencia palestina, espera que el programa la ayude a expresarse mejor en árabe.
Aunque el programa que se ofrece en El Paso es una experiencia educativa singular, los programas de creación literaria por todo Estados Unidos están elaborando planes de estudio basados en el espaol: un crecimiento que refleja cómo están cambiando las características demográficas de ese país. El espaol es la lengua materna de más de 40 millones de personas en Estados Unidos, en contraste con los 32 millones que había en 2005, de acuerdo con cálculos de la Oficina del Censo.
La Universidad Estatal de California en Los ngeles ofrecerá su propia maestría bilingüe a partir del próximo ao. La Universidad Hofstra, en Hempstead, Nueva York, comenzará un posgrado de escritura creativa en espaol en 2018, similar a uno que ya existe en la Universidad de Nueva York. Los estudiantes del programa en espaol y de su contraparte en inglés en la Universidad de Iowa son alentados ahora a tomar clases de cualquiera de los dos programas.
Además, a pesar de estar recuperándose del huracán Harvey durante este semestre, la Universidad de Houston echó a andar un doctorado enfocado en el espaol que enfatiza el estudio literario tanto como la escritura (los estudiantes deben incluir un análisis teórico junto con su tesis de creación literaria).
“Considero a todos estos programas como una unidad, un grupo interesado en formar a los escritores del siglo XXI: bilingües, diversos y representativos de las comunidades que están prosperando en Estados Unidos”, dijo la directora del programa de Houston, Cristina Rivera-Garza.
Los programas de la Universidad de Houston y de la Estatal de California (o Cal State) también son activos en el apoyo a las poblaciones hispanas locales; la de Houston ha crecido en más de 200.000 personas de 2000 a 2016 y la del condado de Los ngeles en aproximadamente 600.000 personas. El director del programa de Cal State, Alex Espinoza, dijo que sus estudiantes ayudarán a los habitantes del este de Los ngeles —la mayoría hispanohablantes— a escribir narraciones biográficas que se contrapongan a las “demasiado generalizadas por los medios”… y por el gobierno de Donald Trump.
De hecho, estos programas podrían considerarse una especie de desafío artístico a la postura del gobierno estadounidense hacia los inmigrantes latinos, representados por sus planes de revocar el programa DACA, que protegía a los estudiantes indocumentados contra la deportación, así como la propuesta de construir un muro fronterizo con México y la eliminación, este ao, de la página web en espaol de la Casa Blanca.
En conjunto, los programas podrían tener un papel importante en formar a escritores jóvenes que den voz públicamente a los distintos aspectos de la experiencia latina en Estados Unidos.
La geografía de Juárez y El Paso —dos comunidades entrelazadas cultural y económicamente, separadas por un tramo del río Bravo en el que el agua apenas llega a la cintura de una persona— es un tema que los alumnos y sus profesores han explorado en sus obras literarias (puedes leer algunas aquí). Quizá la diferencia más marcada entre las ciudades es la violencia relacionada con el narcotráfico del lado de Juárez, que retratan con perturbadores imágenes sangrientas y un vocabulario franco y sin censura.
Juárez-El Paso es el área metropolitana más grande de la frontera, con una población combinada de más de dos millones de personas, aunque una caminata del centro de Juárez al centro de El Paso toma menos de media hora.
Alessandra Narváez-Varela solía cruzar la frontera casi todos los días desde Juárez para tomar clases en la Universidad de Texas y ayudar en el restaurante que su familia tiene en El Paso. Se graduó de la universidad con una especialidad en biología y otra en creación literaria. Estuvo un ao en la Facultad de Medicina, pero “no era lo que esperaba”, dijo. La poesía sí.
Ahora, de 31 aos y parte del programa bilingüe de maestría de El Paso, dice que está escribiendo para reconciliar su doble identidad y dar voz a los asuntos de las mujeres, en especial a la anatomía femenina, que fue lo que la llevó primero a la Medicina. “Una vez que tienes ese tipo de conversación con el cuerpo ya no la puedes soltar”, dijo.
Extraamente, aunque sus raíces más profundas pertenecen al espaol, Narváez-Varela no se sentía segura escribiendo poesía en su lengua materna. Todo lo que escribía en la universidad estaba siempre en inglés. “Quizá la hablante del espaol en mí se sentía relegada a un estatus de ciudadana de segunda tras haber adoptado el inglés como el idioma de mi poesía”, dijo.
Asistí a la presentación que Narváez-Varela dio en una conferencia nacional de escritores en Los ngeles, en la que explicó la manera en que un taller del programa la ayudó a encontrar su voz en espaol.
Había escrito un poema en espaol llamado “Ovarian Cancer” (cáncer de ovario), lleno de imágenes gráficas (comparaba al cáncer con un feto sangrante). Sus compaeros le dijeron que el patrón rítmico no era fluido y criticaron su uso de la rima. Narváez-Varela se dio cuenta de que había estado traduciendo inconscientemente del inglés. Proyectó en una pantalla una copia del poema, corregido a mano por sus compaeros, y al lado una traducción al inglés, y le mostró al público frases que había concebido originalmente en el segundo idioma.
“El espaol y la forma en que se usa para crear música en la poesía difiere radicalmente en cuanto a las sílabas y la rima”, descubrió. “Fue un taller que golpeó mi ego, pero también me iluminó”.
Narváez-Varela entonces comenzó a explorar las identidades mexicana y estadounidense mediante el spanglish. En su poema “Real Mexican” describe, con un lenguaje crudo e inquietante, a un exreo mexicano-estadounidense tan confundido por su identidad latina que no sabe cómo llamarse a sí mismo. En el primer verso el personaje dice: “Tony, Too, Antonio, Anthony, it doesn’t matter, honey…” (“Tony, Too, Antonio, Anthony, no importa, corazón…”).
“Nunca había adoptado un yo poético que explorara la complejidad del spanglish y su significado para mí como ciudadana mexicana naturalizada en Estados Unidos”, dijo Narváez-Varela. “Me di cuenta de que era una proyección de mis propias angustias como mexicoestadounidense. Inconscientemente, había juzgado a otros por la manera en que hablaban spanglish”.
Dijo que estaba tratando de mostrar la manera en que el uso del spanglish por parte del personaje en el poema “es una manifestación vital de su identidad como alguien al margen de ambas sociedades”.
Escribir el poema la ayudó a ver lo artístico de “una lengua tan válida y hermosa como el inglés o el espaol, tan híbrida como el inglés afroestadounidense, y por lo tanto merecedora de un lugar en la poesía”. Huizache, una revista de literatura latina, acaba de publicar “Real Mexican”.
Muchos escritores hispanos importantes han asistido a programas tradicionales de maestría en creación literaria. Conversé con tres de los más relevantes —Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz y Esmeralda Santiago— sobre cómo establecen un puente entre las dos lenguas en su escritura, así como acerca de su experiencia en el posgrado. Todos dijeron que sus programas de maestría no reconocían el lado hispanohablante de su identidad, al no asignar lecturas de autores latinos o por no apoyar los elementos del espaol en su obra.
Cisneros, mexicano-estadounidense, describió una interacción con su asesor de tesis en el prestigiado Iowa Writer’s Worskshop (uno de los principales talleres de creación literaria) cuando comenzó a escribir La casa en Mango Street.
Había escrito la novela corta en inglés, pero le había metido frases en espaol. El asesor la criticó por usar exageradamente la palabra “little” sin saber la frecuencia con la que el sufijo “-ito” —para decir pequeo o lindo— se usa en espaol.
El incidente, dijo, obstaculizó su conexión con el espaol. “No me di cuenta sino hasta que salí de Iowa”, dijo Cisneros. “Estaba escribiendo una carta en espaol y pensé: esta es la voz de ‘Mango Street’”.
Una sola palabra en su lengua materna tuvo un gran efecto: cuando Cisneros nombró a la joven narradora de la novela Esperanza, no solo le estaba dando un nombre bonito. “Esperanza”, en inglés, puede significar aguardar algo, tener alguna expectativa o estar esperanzado. En la historia, la nia expresa poéticamente una mezcla de sentimientos acerca de su nombre cuando dice: “In Spanish, it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color”. [En la traducción de Elena Poniatowska: “En inglés mi nombre quiere decir esperanza. En espaol tiene muchas letras. Quiere decir tristeza, decir espera. Es como el número nueve, como un color lodoso”).
“Quería que fuera un nombre tradicional que no se tradujera bien a la cultura de Estados Unidos”, dijo Cisneros, “así como uno que significara anhelo, deseo y esperanza”.
Junot Díaz, escritor dominicano ganador del Premio Pulitzer, asistió al programa de maestría de la Universidad Cornell y ahora da clases en el Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts. En la educación de posgrado, él aboga por “vínculos con académicos que trabajen con la intersección de lenguas, de criollismo, el multilingüismo”.
Explicó su propio proceso mental de traducción de la siguiente manera: “Si estoy escribiendo un personaje para quien el espaol es dominante, este habla y piensa dentro de mí en espaol y yo traduzco la mayoría de eso a inglés. Algunas palabras no se dejan traducir: a veces, es el gozo de la palabra o la energía con que pulsa en la oración original en espaol”. Por ejemplo, Díaz utiliza libremente groserías en inglés en su trabajo, pero en ocasiones opta por sus ásperos equivalentes en espaol.
Esmeralda Santiago, autora de las memorias Cuando era puertorriquea, y quien tiene una maestría del Sarah Lawrence College, escribe sus borradores totalmente de manera bilingüe. “Escribo tan rápido como puedo y no me preocupo de si lo que aparece en la hoja está en espaol o en inglés”, dijo. “Luego, cuando corrijo, traduzco la mayoría del espaol a inglés si es para publicarse en este último. Para mí, el espaol y el inglés son la misma lengua”.
En el programa de El Paso, los profesores se esfuerzan por responder eficazmente a los estudiantes que escriben en inglés, espaol o ambos. Tratan de amoldarse a cada uno de los alumnos hablando en su lengua preferida. “Yo hablo en inglés y ellos en espaol”, dijo Daniel Chacón, uno de los diez docentes. “Luego puedo repetir y aclarar en espaol”.
Cualquiera que sea su nivel de dominio, los estudiantes deben lidiar con ambas lenguas. “Tienen que hacer el esfuerzo de cerrar la brecha”, dijo el director, José de Piérola. “Puede ser muy difícil que te presionen así, pero te hace crecer”.
En uno de los talleres de Piérola, a un estudiante que hablaba poco espaol le tocó dirigir un análisis grupal del cuento de otro alumno. El cuento estaba en inglés, pero él no podía entender a los miembros del grupo que hablaban en espaol, y tenía que pedirles a los compaeros bilingües que le explicaran.
Muchas de las lecturas están disponibles con traducción, pero se alienta incluso a los estudiantes que perciben como un reto leer en un segundo idioma a que revisen los textos originales. Algunos recurren a herramientas como Google Translate, a pesar de las limitaciones de esta para interpretar el lenguaje literario.
“Cuando los hispanohablantes leen a poetas estadounidenses en inglés o viceversa, cambia cómo se relacionan con su propia tradición”, dijo la profesora Cote-Botero.
Indicó que intenta ensearle a los estudiantes a experimentar con su escritura al hacerlos contrastar versiones en inglés y en espaol de diversos sonetos.
Shakespeare, dijo Cote-Botero, estandarizó el verso en inglés usando un patrón constante de cinco acentos. “Se acerca más a la forma de hablar en inglés y a los latidos del corazón”, sealó. Un ejemplo que se cita mucho es el verso inicial del soneto 18 de Shakespeare:  “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” (“A un día de verano compararte?”).
Por otro lado, el soneto en espaol se basa en un verso de catorce sílabas. Cuando los estudiantes “mezclan los dos, surgen cosas interesantes”, dijo la profesora. Quedarse “dentro de los límites de tu propia tradición te pone más en riesgo de repetirte a ti mismo”.
Con un acercamiento bilingüe, dijo Chacón, otro de los profesores, “puedes jugar con tu propio idioma un poco más. James Joyce pudo jugar con la lengua porque creció con el gaélico y puso atención a su sonido”.
Para exponer a sus estudiantes a estilos de escritura en otras lenguas, Cote-Botero aade a las listas de lectura para clases algunas traducciones de koans zen originalmente en japonés, así como de Aristóteles.
Así que, al animar a los estudiantes a explorar distintas tradiciones y entornos literarios, el programa de El Paso no es solo sobre dos idiomas.
Conforme se acerca a su graduación en noviembre –su tesis es un libro de poesía sobre mujeres–, Narváez-Varela dijo que escribir en dos idiomas la ha sacado de su zona de confort. Esta es una razón clave por la que eligió el programa y espera llevar consigo esa experiencia a su trabajo como docente en una universidad comunitaria.
Como una mexicana que explora la vida más allá de la frontera, dijo que continuará, a través de sus poemas, “haciendo preguntas difíciles y esperando ninguna o varias respuestas, tan lúdica y apasionadamente como sea posible”.",0
"Story by the Associated Press; curated by Jason Howerton
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A California state senator who authored gun control legislation asked for campaign donations in exchange for introducing an undercover FBI agent to an arms trafficker, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.
The allegations against State Sen. Leland Yee were outlined in an FBI affidavit in support of a criminal complaint. The affidavit accuses Yee of conspiracy to deal firearms without a license and to illegally import firearms. He was arrested Wednesday.
Yee is also accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and cash payments to provide introductions, help a client get a contract and influence legislation. He or members of his campaign staff accepted at least $42,800 in cash or campaign contributions from undercover FBI agents in exchange for carrying out the agents’ specific requests, the court documents allege.
Yee discussed helping the agent get weapons worth $500,000 to $2.5 million, including shoulder fired automatic weapons and missiles, and took him through the entire process of acquiring them from a Muslim separatist group in the Philippines to bringing them to the United States, according to the affidavit by FBI Special Agent Emmanuel V. Pascua.
He was unhappy with his life and told the agent he wanted to hide out in the Philippines, according to the affidavit.
“There’s a part of me that wants to be like you,” he told the undercover agent, according to the affidavit. “You know how I’m going to be like you? Just be a free agent there.”
The introduction with the trafficker took place at a San Francisco restaurant earlier this month, according to the documents. Yee said he wouldn’t go to the Philippines until November.
“Once things start to move, it’s going to attract attention. We just got to be extra-extra careful,” he said, according to court documents.
The affidavit names Yee and 25 others, including Raymond Chow, a onetime gang leader with ties to San Francisco’s Chinatown known as “Shrimp Boy,” and Keith Jackson, Yee’s campaign aide. Jackson is accused of multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud.
Chow and Yee were arrested Wednesday during a series of raids in Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area.
According to court documents, Yee performed “official acts” in exchange for donations from undercover FBI agents, as he sought to dig himself out of a $70,000 debt incurred during a failed San Francisco mayoral bid.
Yee is also accused of accepting $10,000 in January 2013 from an undercover FBI agent in exchange for making a call to the California Department of Public Health in support of a contract was considering.
The agent who discussed arms with Yee presented himself as a member of Ghee Kung Tong, a fraternal organization in San Francisco’s Chinatown that Chow reportedly headed. It was among the sites searched Wednesday.
Firefighters were seen going inside with a circular saw and later said they had cracked a safe. FBI agents were seen coming out with boxes and trash bags full of evidence that they loaded into an SUV.
Chow is accused of money laundering, conspiracy to receive and transport stolen property and conspiracy to traffic contraband cigarettes.
Yee is the third Democratic senator to face charges this year. Sen. Rod Wright was convicted of perjury and voter fraud for lying about his legal residence in Los Angeles County, and Sen. Ron Calderon has been indicted on federal corruption charges. Wright and Calderon are taking a voluntary leave of absence, with pay, although Republicans have called for them to be suspended or expelled from the Legislature.
Mark Hedlund, spokesman for Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, confirmed that the FBI searched Yee’s office in the state capitol on Wednesday.
Steinberg, D-Sacramento, said he had no comment and did not know anything about the investigation.
Officers from the California Highway Patrol and Senate sergeant-at-arms details were standing guard outside Yee’s office, where a morning newspaper remained untouched.
Yee, 65, represents western San Francisco and much of San Mateo County. A spokesman for the senator, Dan Lieberman, said he had no comment, but the senator’s office would release a statement in the afternoon.
He is best known for his efforts to strengthen open records, government transparency and whistleblower protection laws, including legislation to close a loophole in state public records laws after the CSU Stanislaus Foundation refused to release its $75,000 speaking contract with former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in 2010.
Chow ran a Chinese criminal organization with ties to Hong Kong and was convicted of gun charges. But he had recently been held up as an example of successful rehabilitation and was praised for his work in the community.
Yee’s arrest came as a shock to Chinese-Americans who see the senator as a pioneering leader in the community and a mainstay of San Francisco politics, said David Lee, director of the Chinese American Voters Education Committee.
“People are waiting to see what happens, and they are hoping for the best, that the charges turn out not to be true,” said Lee, whose organization just held a get-out-the-vote event with Yee and other Chinese-American elected officials last week.
For his efforts to uphold the California Public Records Act, Yee was honored last week by the Northern California chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, which awarded him its public official citation for his efforts to maintain the requirements of the California Public Records Act.
Yee has at times clashed with fellow Democrats for casting votes of conscience, refusing to support the Democratic budget proposal in 2011 because of its deep cuts to education, social services and education. He also opposed legislation by a fellow Democrat, Assemblyman Paul Fong of Cupertino, that banned the sale of shark fins used for Chinese shark fin soup, saying that it unfairly targeted the Chinese-American community.
Yee is among three Democrats running this year for secretary of state, the office that oversees elections and campaign finance reporting. He lost a bid for mayor of San Francisco in 2011.
A man was charged last year for threatening Yee over legislation that he proposed to limit rapid reloading of assault weapons. The bill would have prohibited the use of devices that allow users to swiftly reload military-style assault weapons. Lee also authored legislation that that would have required the state to study safe storage of firearms.
Chow acknowledged in an unpublished autobiography that he ran prostitution rings in the 1980s, smuggled drugs and extorted thousands from business owners as a Chinatown gang member, KGO-TV reported two years ago.
In 1992, Chow was among more than two-dozen people indicted on racketeering charges for their alleged involvement in crimes ranging from teenage prostitution to an international drug trade mostly involving heroin.
He was later convicted of gun charges and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. He spent 11 years in prison and was released in 2003 after he cut a deal with the government to testify against another high-ranking associate, Peter Chong. Chong was later convicted of racketeering.
Chow told KGO-TV in a 2012 interview that he had changed and was working with at-risk children in San Francisco.
U. S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California issued a statement in 2012 recognizing Chow as a former offender who had become an asset to his community, the Sacramento Bee reported. Chow was also praised by San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee for his “willingness to give back to the community,” the Bee reported.",0

TGP: Was former DNC Chairwoman having an affair with her IT staffer?Or are Democrats about to be caught in the largest political scandal in US history?
The more you learn about Democratic IT scammer Imran Awan — the more you see the profile of a bold and careless criminal mind.
Imran Awan worked for Debbie Wasserman Schultz for thirteen years since she came into office in 2004 as a Florida representative. She only fired him this past week and would have kept paying her “IT expert” even when he was living in Pakistan.
Three Pakistani brothers who managed the IT affairs for several Democratic government officials were relieved of their duties in February on suspicion that they accessed specific computer networks without permission, also known as hacking.
Imran Awan, who started working for Wasserman Schultz in 2005, received $164,600 in 2016, with close to $20,000 of that coming from Wasserman Schultz.
His brother Jamal, who started working as a staffer in 2014, was paid $157,350.12 in 2016. Abid, who started working in 2005, was paid $160,943 in 2016.
Imran’s wife, Hina Alvi, who was employed as a staffer since February 2007, was paid 168,300 in 2016. Rao Abbas was paid $85,049 in 2016.
Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives in February.
Most of the House Members fired the Awans subsequently.Only Debbie Wasserman Schultz kept Imran Awan on the pay roll up to the day he got arrest for Bank Fraud after trying to flee the country.
The rest of the family fled since months to Pakistan along with hundreds of thousands of tax-payermoneythey mysteriously were able to wire.
Democrats were willing or unwillingly compromised by the Awans and Sensitive Information leaked to foreign Enemies! (Muslim Brotherhood – Yemen Raid with dead soldier for example?) Many of them have Seats on Committees that handle highly sensitive information.
According to Redditt — Imran Awan is now released with an GPS ankle monitor until his preliminary hearing on Aug. 21.
More information is coming out on Imran Awan and his criminal activities.Awan pretended to be his wife when requesting a loan from the Congressional Federal Credit Union and got it! He had the credit union wire $165,000 to PAKISTAN – no questions asked.
Bank fraud was the stated charge on which Awan was arrested at Dulles Airport this week, just as he was trying to flee the United States for Pakistan, via Qatar. That is the same route taken by Awan’s wife, Hina Alvi, in March, when she suddenly fled the country, with three young daughters she yanked out of school, mega-luggage, and $12,400 in cash.
By then, the proceeds of the fraudulent $165,000 loan they’d gotten from the Congressional Federal Credit Union had been sent ahead. It was part of a $283,000 transfer that Awan managed to wire from Capitol Hill. He pulled it off — hilariously, if infuriatingly — by pretending to be his wife in a phone call with the credit union. Told that his proffered reason for the transfer (“funeral arrangements”) wouldn’t fly, “Mrs.” Awan promptly repurposed: Now “she” was “buying property.” Asking no more questions, the credit union wired the money . . . to Pakistan.…
…Congressional-staff salaries are modest, in the $40,000 range. For some reason, Awan was paid about four times as much. He also managed to get his wife, Alvi, on the House payroll . . . then his brother, Abid Awan . . . then Abid’s wife, Natalia Sova. The youngest of the clan, Awan’s brother Jamal, came on board in 2014 — the then-20-year-old commanding an annual salary of $160,000. A few of these arrangements appear to have been sinecures: While some Awans were rarely seen around the office, we now know they were engaged in extensive financial shenanigans away from the Capitol.
Awan also threatened and tried to extort cash from his stepmother after his father’s death.
Their own stepmother, a devout Muslim, called police in Virginia and said they used high-tech devices to wiretap her home and tried to extort her into signing papers that would give them access to cash stored in Pakistan in their deceased father’s name.
The stepmother, Samina Gilani, said in court documents that Imran said he was “very powerful” and would have her loved ones kidnapped in Pakistan.
Court records show that their father changed his last name, and two relatives said that was because he detested illegal behavior by his sons.
In public lawsuits in Fairfax County, Va., the brothers have been accused of life insurance fraud as well as fraud involving a car dealership.
This is a description of a complete slimeball. Who kicks his stepmother out of her home when she has just lost her husband?
The more you read about Imran Awan the more you see the picture of a complete soulless criminal.
So why was he hanging around Wasserman Schultz for 13 years?Either they were having an affair or Imran had the goods on the Democratic Party.Possibly both scenarios are true.",1
"More than half of all American adults start off their morning with at least one cup of joe. Most drink coffee to wake up and simply get through the day. But new research adds to the evidence that coffee can have significant health benefits -- far beyond helping you make it to that morning meeting.
The latest study finds coffee may lower the risk for the most serious type of skin cancer, malignant melanoma. Prior research has shown coffee may help prevent other types of non-melanoma skin cancers. However, this is the first large-scale study to look specifically at malignant melanoma, which is the fifth most common cancer in the U. S. and the leading cause of skin cancer deaths.
For the study, published Tuesday in JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute, researchers analyzed data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study on more than 447,000 non-Hispanic whites, who are at higher risk of skin cancer. Study subjects filled out questionnaires about their eating habits, including coffee drinking, and were followed-up after about 10 years.
The researchers found that frequent coffee drinkers -- those who consumed four cups or more per day -- had a 20 percent lower risk for developing malignant melanoma than those who drank less coffee. The researchers also observed the protective benefits of coffee increased the more a person drank. Decaffeinated coffee did not provide the same protective benefits.
The authors adjusted for other factors that might influence skin cancer rates, including ultraviolet radiation exposure, body mass index, age, gender, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking history.
While the results of this new study are encouraging for coffee drinkers, the authors say their findings are preliminary, and may not be applicable to other populations. ""Because of its high disease burden, lifestyle modifications with even modest protective effects may have a meaningful impact on melanoma morbidity,"" the researchers conclude.
They called for further research into the impact coffee and caffeine may have on developing melanoma.
Previous studies have shown that regular coffee consumption may help reduce the risk of other serious conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, depression, liver disease and even early death. The beverage's antioxidant properties have also long been associated with reducing the risk for other types of skin cancer.
One study published in 2012 in  the journal Cancer involved 113,000 adults followed for 20-plus years. In that time, 22,800 participants developed basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer, which is rarely fatal. The study found that people who drank more than three cups of coffee were 17 percent less likely to develop basal cell carcinoma, compared with those who drank coffee less than once a month.",0
"The union that once set the gold standard for American wages is giving up pay rises in exchange for a piece of the auto industry's profits and the promise of thousands of new jobs.
Under agreements struck with Ford and General Motors, most of the companies' factory workers will get profit-sharing cheques instead of annual rises. They will also get a signing bonus. In turn, the carmakers will increase their workforces and invest billions more dollars in their factories.
It is an unusual turnabout for the United Auto Workers. For decades, its members' pay and benefits were the envy of workers around the world, and it would not hesitate to strike to protect them. But the agreement signals a new reality. After the industry nearly collapsed two years ago, a sobered UAW is no longer fighting the Big Three but fighting to compete against rivals that pay their workers far less.
""We are aware of the competition that Ford and General Motors and Chrysler face,"" UAW president Bob King said on Tuesday after announcing terms of a new four-year contract with Ford. ""If we are going to succeed in the long run and really be able to have long-run security and decent income for our membership, we can't put Ford and GM and Chrysler at a competitive disadvantage.""
Ford and the UAW agreed on a four-year contract on Tuesday, three weeks after the union reached a similar agreement with General Motors. The companies are promising at least 17,000 new US jobs over the life of the contracts, and are offering workers signing bonuses and profit-sharing payments. Costs will be cut because companies will not be paying annual wage increases to their factory workers and will hire thousands of the new workers at lower rates.
King expects some of his members will be unhappy. But he thinks they can live with the terms. GM workers have already ratified their agreement; Ford workers are expected to wrap up voting by 14 October.
""They know the competitive structure as well as I do. They know their family and friends who are underemployed [and] unemployed,"" King said. ""They know how important it is to have long-term jobs so they can be back in 2015 [for the next contract negotiations]. Maybe we will be able to do some fixed-cost increases then.""
Ford workers will get at least $16,700 (10,800) over the four-year contract, in the form of a $6,000 signing bonus, $7,000 in lump-sum and inflation protection payments and at least $3,700 in profit sharing this year. That is more generous than GM's agreement, which guarantees workers at least $11,500.
Ford plans to add 5,750 US factory jobs under the deal, on top of 6,250 it announced earlier this year, for a total of 12,000 jobs by 2015. It also pledged to invest $4.8bn in its US factories. When combined with $1.4bn in investments previously announced, Ford plans to invest $6.2bn by 2015.
Union leaders approved the deal on Tuesday after a meeting in Detroit. The deal is subject to a vote by Ford's workers.
If they agree to the contract, Ford's 41,000 workers who are paid an hourly wage, rather than a fixed salary, will get $1,000 more as a signing bonus than the $5,000 bonus GM workers got. The GM deal also gives most workers profit-sharing payments instead of annual rises and promises 6,400 new or retained jobs.
John Fleming, Ford vice-president of manufacturing, said most of the 5,750 additional hires will start at $15.78 an hour, a fraction of the $28 hourly wage of Ford's older workers. They will get $19.28 after four years. Ford currently has 70 entry-level workers, but will hire thousands more. The union agreed to the lower wage in 2007 when Ford was losing billions of dollars.
The deal will increase Ford's labour costs at first, but bring them down as more entry-level workers are hired. The company has the highest labour cost in the US auto industry.
Ford's hourly labour cost, including wages, benefits and pensions, was $58 last year. GM's was $56 and Toyota's was $55, according to the Center for Automotive Research. Volkswagen, with a new plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, had the lowest cost at $38, followed by Hyundai at $44.
""The tentative agreement will enable us to improve our overall competitiveness here in the United States,"" Fleming told reporters.
Ford also will save money by offering retirement-eligible production workers $50,000 to leave the company by 31 March, rising to $100,000 for skilled trades workers such as pipe fitters or electricians. The retirements would clear the way for more workers at the lower wage, but their numbers are limited to 20% of the workforce.
Approval of the contract could be a problem. Workers still harbour some anger at chief executive Alan Mulally's $26.5m pay package from last year. Many workers also feel Ford is healthy enough to offer annual rises. Ford earned $6.6bn last year.
Gary Walkowicz is a worker at Ford's Dearborn truck plant. He helped shoot down a round of concessions at Ford in 2009, and says he is against this deal because it does not restore pay rises and other concessions the workers have made since 2007. He contends that it also makes the entry-level wage permanent.
""They say, 'OK, take this, and forget about everything we took away,'"" he said of Ford.
But Rick McDonald, an electrician at a transmission plant in Livonia, Michigan, said that although he had not seen all the details, he liked what he had heard so far.
""I think it's pretty fair,"" he said. ""Would more money be nice? Of course. I feel as though I make a pretty good hourly rate.""
McDonald, though, has concerns about 10% of the profit-sharing checks being sent to a trust fund for retiree healthcare and some other provisions.
Up next is Chrysler Group, where the talks could be more contentious. The company is not as profitable as Ford and GM and probably cannot afford the same deals. Chrysler workers have stayed on the job under a contract extension that expires on 29 October.
The UAW talks are watched closely because they set wages for more than 112,000 workers in the auto industry and set the bar for pay at auto parts makers and foreign-owned carmakers.",0
"Romania’sone-month-old government refused to reverselegislative changes that weaken the nation’s clampdown on corruption and have sparked the largest protests since the collapse of communism.
While acknowledging people’s right to demonstrate, the ruling Social Democrats are backing the cabinet despite the resignation of a minister on Thursday. Afourth evening of public dissent Friday saw more than 300,000 people fill the streets of major cities, setting a new record turnout and marking the widest spread movement in the country’s modern history, local media estimated. About 120,000 people gathered infreezing temperatures outside the government buildingin Bucharest, with more than 40,000 in western Romanian city of Cluj-Napoca. Thousands marched in tens of other cities, including outside the country’s borders.
“We took a decision and we’re going forward,” Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu told a news conference with party leader Liviu Dragnea earlier Thursday, pledging to also make good on pre-election promises of tax cuts and state salary hikes. “The party assured me we have its full support to continue our activity and proceed with the governing plan.”
The Social Democrats face the largest backlash since the 1989uprising that ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Romania’s third government in two years incurred the wrath of the public and President Klaus Iohannis by unexpectedly easing punishments for officials who abuse their positions and by seeking to free others from prison. The protestersin the European Union and NATO member nation back the anti-graft drive that’s ensnared top officials, including an ex-Social Democrat premier.

The turmoil sent the leu 1 percent weakeragainst the euro on Wednesday,the steepest decline in more than two years and one that erased all of its 2017 gains. It recovered part of the losses and is trading little changed at 4.5220 per euro on Friday in Bucharest. While S&P Global Ratings said risks to Romania’s investment-grade status are currently balanced, it warned that the turmoil risks denting investor confidence and harming growth.
“I am deeply concerned by the decree of the Romanian government,” said U. S. Senator John McCain, head of the Senate’s Armed Services Committee. “With ever-increasing threats to democracy in Europe today from Russia and its proxies, Romania cannot afford to retreat in the fight against corruption.”
The government wants to decriminalize abuse-of-office offenses for sums of less than 200,000 lei ($48,000) and it sent a draft law to parliamentto pardon prisoners serving sentences shorter than five years, excluding rapists and repeat offenders. While it says it’s trying to ease prisonovercrowding, its actions would free hundreds ex-officials and halt probes into others.
They include an investigation into Dragnea, who’s seeking a retrial after receiving a suspended sentence for electoral fraud. He denies wrongdoing and on Thursday blamed the protests on a misinformation campaign and encouragement from the president.
“The Social Democrats’ strategy is to shield current and past party politicians from corruption probes,” and “make it practically impossible for serving politicians to be prosecuted for corruption,” James Sawyer, a London-based researcher at Eurasia Group, said in an e-mailed note.

Iohannis, who’s challenging the government’s actions in theConstitutional Court together with the ombudsman and the judiciary watchdog, said the only way to end the unrest is to repeal the steps. He’s seeking talks with Grindeanu next week andwants to address parliament on Feb. 7. Prosecutors said they are investigating the process through which the cabinet approved the measures.
“We have to find good solutions,”Iohannis told reporters at the start of an EU summit in Malta on Friday. “The rule of law has to prevail, the European values have to prevail. This is what I believe will happen. Investors are not threatened. This is a matter of principle for the population, for politicians.”
The controversy in Romania comes amid concern that other regional governments are undermining the rule of law. The EU has reprimanded Poland and Hungary for state encroachment on thejudiciary and the media. The government in Warsaw backed away from plans to tighten abortion rules after mass protests.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker criticized Romania’s actions, saying “the fight against corruption needs to be advanced, not undone.” Six embassies, including those of the U. S. and Germany, said they “hope the government will reverse this unhelpful course.”
Anti-graft prosecutors are working on more than 2,000abuse-of-office cases. In the past two years, they’ve sent more than 1,000 people to trial, seeking to recover damages in excess of 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion). The country of 19 million people ranks fourth-worst for graft in the EU, according to Berlin-based Transparency International.",0
"The Plum Line     Opinion  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events     Guess what: Republicans may be about to raise your taxes         Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.    You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.
House Republican leaders on Nov. 2 proposed legislation that would overhaul the U. S. tax code. Here's what you need to know about it. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)    Before Republicans released their tax-cut plan, some of us predicted that while they would describe it as a “middle-class tax cut,” their bill would likely shower enormous benefits on the wealthy and corporations while giving a pittance to the middle class. They’d follow George W. Bush’s formula, which was to give something to ordinary folks, even if the benefits to most people were minuscule compared with what the rich would get. Now that we have the details, it turns out that criticism was not exactly correct. In fact, while their plan is indeed centered on cuts for the wealthy and corporations, they’re giving benefits only to some taxpayers. And — as we are learning from a host of new analyses that have been released — a lot of those in the middle class (and the upper-middle class, and even the upper class) will actually see their taxes increase. The Republican plan cuts some taxes and eliminates some deductions, which means that whether you win or lose depends on your particular situation. For instance, the standard deduction will be almost doubled, which is good if you don’t itemize. But if you do — and if you have a large family so you benefit from personal exemptions (which are eliminated), or you rely on deductions for things such as state and local taxes, student loan interest, and medical expenses — you could find yourself with a larger tax bill. On average, the bill does what you’d expect from a Republican plan, giving modest benefits to those at the bottom and the middle, and large benefits to those at the top, in what resembles an exponential curve (see this nice chartfrom the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities). But that’s on average. On an individual basis, some people will get cuts and some people will get increases. The Republican plan is also full of less-noticed provisions that could prove damaging to some people and even catastrophic for others. Teachers, for instance, will no longer be able to deduct what they spend out of pocket on materials for their classrooms.Another change would require that graduate students who get tuition waivers, as most PhD students do, would have to pay taxes on the waivers as though they were income, requiring them to come up with thousands of dollars to pay the government for “income” they saw only in the form of permission to attend school. If that had been the law when I went to graduate school, either I would have had to live in my car or I would have dropped out (or never gone in the first place), and I’m sure that’s true for thousands of other people. Millions of other people could see their taxes increase. Let’s start with an analysis by Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley of the New York Times: Nearly half of all middle-class families would pay more in taxes in 2026 than they would under current rules if the proposed House tax bill became law, and about one-third would pay more in 2018, according to a New York Times analysis, a striking finding for a bill promoted as a middle-class tax cut. President Trump and congressional Republicans have pitched the plan unveiled last week as a tax cut for most Americans. But millions of middle-class families — particularly those with children — would see an immediate tax increase, averaging about $2,000. Among the hardest-hit under the plan would be some of the most vulnerable taxpayers: those with huge out-of-pocket medical expenses. By 2026, 45 percent of middle-class families would pay more than what they would under the existing tax system. Republicans will argue that those people will end up okay, because the corporate tax cuts will eventually produce a huge increase in growth and wages. Even if you’re being generous to this claim, the promised payoff is hypothetical. At some point in the future it might happen, while these tax increases are direct and assured.    Democratic lawmakers, students and think tanks spoke out on Nov. 7 against the GOP's tax plan, specifically highlighting the cut to the student loan interest deduction program. (Reuters)    Now let’s look at an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.Its data shows that in 2018, 8 percent of taxpayers will see a tax increase. Since some provisions are set to expire, by 2027, 18 percent of taxpayers will be paying more than they do now. But that’s only part of the story. It turns out that the groups hit hardest are those in the middle and upper-middle class. Looking at the 2027 figures, among those in the middle quintile (those with average incomes of $72,000), 21 percent will be paying more than they do now. In the next highest quintile (average incomes of $115,900), 24 percent will be paying higher taxes. In the next highest (average incomes of $207,000), 33 percent will be paying higher taxes. How many people does that add up to? This morning, a congressional staffer on the minority staff of the Senate Budget Committee tweeted figures based on Joint Committee on Taxation numbers showing that by 2027, 100 million households would see either a tax increase or no tax cut, 36 million would see a tax increase of at least $100, and 23 million would see an increase of at least $500. Those figures show that many moderately wealthy and even very wealthy people will see their tax bills rise. And as Paul Krugman points out today, there is a discernible pattern: Even among high-income Americans, the plan seems designed to reward those who don’t work for a living — or more precisely, the less you actually do to earn your income, the bigger your tax break. Business owners would owe less in taxes than high-earning professionals; passive investors, who just sit there and collect dividends, would owe less than those who at least run their businesses. And wealthy heirs, who did nothing to earn their wealth except choose the right parents, would pay no taxes at all. One way to look at this is that it’s a tribute to the Republicans’ ambition. They could have done what they did when Bush was president: cut a bunch of taxes, pay for it with borrowing, and leave it at that, with no one losing in the short run even if the wealthy gained a lot more than everyone else. This time they wanted to remake the tax code, but in doing so they ended up picking a lot of winners and losers. There are more analyses of the Republican plan coming, and they may differ a bit here and there depending on the assumptions they use. But the basic conclusion is becoming clear: Many, many people — into the millions or even tens of millions — will be paying higher taxes under the Republican bill.",0
"SHANGHAI — China's first NHL game did not impress everybody.
JOJO, a Chinese internet star who was covering the game for iQiyi, a popular Chinese online video platform, left after the first period of the Sept. 21 pre-season tilt between the Los Angeles Kings and Vancouver Canucks at Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai.
""It was cold,"" she told NBC News.
While China may still have a lot to learn about ice hockey, the NHL appears ready to teach.
Over the last three years, the Kings, Canucks, Boston Bruins, Montreal Canadiens, New York Islanders, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Washington Capitals, along with the league itself, have held regular youth and coaching clinics in Shanghai, Beijing, and other Chinese cities.
""But now, we're being more aggressive about having a number of clinics throughout the country,"" David Proper, the NHL’s executive vice president of international strategy, said. According to Proper, the league will host upwards of 15 youth clinics all over China this season, which at least doubles last year's presence. This figure doesn't include the coaching and team-run clinics. The NHL will also work with the Beijing Ministry of Education to introduce ball hockey into schools.
“We understand that to grow the sport here in China, we do have to invest in the infrastructure, from children on up,” Bill Daly, the league’s deputy commissioner, said.
""We want more kids playing hockey,"" Kings president Luc Robitaille added.
This is just the beginning for the NHL in China. Along with these league and team-initiated grassroots efforts, Proper said that the NHL has entered into an agreement with Bloomage International Group, a Chinese-based corporation focused on developing sports nationwide, to play a minimum of six times over the next eight years in the country. Those figures include this recent foray into Shanghai and Beijing.
The NHL is not the only hockey league that’s eyeing the Chinese market. The Russia-based Kontinental Hockey League, widely considered to the world’s second-best hockey league after the NHL, established China’s top professional team, the Kunlun Red Star, just two years ago.
Mike Keenan, Kunlun’s head coach, has previously told NBC News that China will build 1,000 ice rinks by 2022, about four times more than the current number. Each year, these fresh sheets of ice are expected to introduce 100,000 kids to skates.
All roads seem to lead to the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022. While the NHL decided not to take a mid-season break so that players could participate in the PyeongChang Winter Games this February, it's presumed that the league cannot afford to miss out on prime exposure in the world's largest economy in 2022.
Kings and Canucks players, who had been whisked thousands of miles away from their already-strenuous normal preparation for the regular season, seemed to realize what was at stake for the league, and potentially, their own pocketbooks.
""This is a gold mine,"" Canucks defenseman Erik Gudbranson said.
""You've seen it with basketball. It's huge. [Kobe] is a mega-star here,"" Kings defenseman Alec Martinez said. ""We could follow in the NBA's footsteps and do some of the same things.""
But for now, it's a tough sell for a country mostly unfamiliar with ice hockey.
On Sept. 21, an announced 10,088 dotted Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai, capacity 18,000. Two days later, an announced 12,159 watched the Kings and Canucks face off again, this time at Cadillac Arena in Beijing, capacity 18,000.
In contrast, a pair of early October National Basketball Association (NBA) exhibitions between the Golden State Warriors and Minnesota Timberwolves, which included a match-up at Mercedes-Benz Arena, sold out within an hour after tickets went on sale, according to a spokesperson from NBA Asia.
In the bigger picture, China currently has 1,101 registered adult and youth hockey players, according to the International Ice Hockey Federation. As far back as 2006, Hu Jiashi, then-vice president of the China Basketball Association, estimated that 300 to 400 million Chinese either regularly play or watch basketball.
“Rome isn't built in a day,” Daly, the league’s deputy commissioner, said. “The effort here is to build from the grassroots up. To try to grow the appreciation for the sport, the understanding of the sport.”
Canucks president Trevor Linden believes that the NHL is prepared for this uphill battle. ""I think the NHL's plan here is a consistent, well-developed plan on many fronts,"" he said. ""It needs to be a long-term commitment.""
For Martinez, it's just about taking it one step at a time.
""The game of hockey has treated me very well,” the defenseman said. “Hopefully, it can get ingrained in another culture. If I can help one kid here enjoy the game as much as I do, that's a pretty cool thing.""",0
"The giant tortoise Lonesome George, whose failed efforts to produce offspring made him a symbol of disappearing species, was found dead on Sunday, officials at the Galapagos National Park announced.
Lonesome George was believed to be the last living member of the Pinta island subspecies and had become an ambassador of sorts for the islands off Ecuador's coast whose unique flora and fauna helped inspire Charles Darwin's ideas on evolution.
The tortoise's age was not known but scientists believed he was about 100, not especially old for giant tortoises, who can live well over a century. Scientists had expected him to live another few decades at least.
Various mates had been provided for Lonesome George after he was found in 1972 in what proved unsuccessful attempts to keep his subspecies alive.
He lived at a tortoise breeding center on the archipelago's island of Santa Cruz. He was found Sunday morning in his pen by his longtime keeper, Fausto Llerena, the park said in a statement.
Attempts were initially made to mate Lonesome George with two female tortoises from Wolf Volcano. But the eggs they produced were infertile.
Two females from Spanish island's tortoise population, the species most closely related to Pinta tortoises, were placed with him last year.
The park said the cause of his death would be investigated.
The Galapagos' giant tortoise population was decimated after the arrival of humans but a recovery program run by the park and the Charles Darwin Foundation has increased the overall population from 3,000 in 1974 to 20,000 today.",0
"Britain's biggest bank, HSBC, is still trying to repair its online banking system, which has failed for the second day running.
The personal banking website is not allowing customers to log on, while business accounts are running slowly.
On Tuesday afternoon, HSBC said it was getting closer to solving the problem, which affected online accounts for up to nine hours on Monday.
A spokesperson said it was ""a complex technical issue within our systems"".
The bank is running tests across its servers to try and identify the exact problem, and said that its IT team had been working ""non-stop"" since yesterday to find a solution.
HSBC said it was not a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack and was not caused by anything external.
""This is not a cyber-attack or any other malicious act,"" said John Hackett, HSBC's UK chief operating officer.
The bank said its mobile app for personal customers was still functioning.
In total, HSBC has 17 million account-holders in the UK.
Business customers were experiencing ""significantly reduced capacity"", with all services running much more slowly than normal, the bank said.
Customers of HSBC's subsidiary, First Direct, are not affected.
HSBC said that no customers would lose out as a result of the issue.
""Any fees customers incur as a result of this outage period will be waived,"" said Mr Hackett.
Nevertheless, angry customers took to Twitter to complain. One described the situation as ""shocking disgraceful customer service"".
Others said they had been charged a 5 daily overdraft fee, but were unable to put money into their accounts.
Sam Middleton-Bray, from Hampshire, said she had had difficulty getting information about what was happening.
""It's incredibly frustrating and we're not getting a lot of information from HSBC other than their brief messages on Twitter.  Their website says to call the 0345 number, but I called it yesterday three times and got an engaged tone,"" she told the BBC.
One or two customers complained that the mobile app was not working either, despite HSBC's assurances.
HSBC was hit by a previous IT glitch in August 2015, which prevented 275,000 payments going through just ahead of the Bank Holiday weekend.
One senior MP called on the boss of the bank to make sure such failures are not repeated.
""The frequency of these failures across the financial services sector suggests a systemic weakness in IT infrastructure. This is concerning."" said Andrew Tyrie, the head of the Treasury Select Committee.
""I will be asking the chief executive of HSBC, and the regulators, for an explanation of these failures and action taken to sort them out. They just keep coming.""
HSBC customers affected by the problem are being advised to use the automated telephone banking service, on 03457 404 404. Business customers should call 03457 60 60 60.
Those with business accounts are usually restricted to transferring a maximum of 10,000 via telephone banking, but this limit has been raised to 100,000.
Otherwise, customers should go to their local branch, HSBC said.",0

"Food Network’s Guy Fieri has been cooking in a parking lot in Sonoma, Calif. since last Thursday. Restaurateur and chef José Andrés, meanwhile, has parked satellite kitchens across Puerto Rico since September 25.
Lines are long, but themenus — ranging from mashed potatoes to paella — serve one thing: comfort food.
In the devastating wake and haze of Hurricane Maria and Northern California’s wildfires, both celebrity chefs are among the many first responders stepping up to the plate, bringing their skills — and fistfuls of star power — to the table.
Fieri, a Santa Rosa, Calif.resident among the area’s estimated 100,000 displaced by wildfires that seared through neighborhoods, businessesand wineries in Northern California’s wine country, assembled friends, familyand colleagues, as well as mobile barbecues, in the Veterans Memorial Building’s parking lot in Sonoma.
Working with The Salvation Army, they arrived to serve, and served plenty: more than5,000 people a day.
“This ordeal is far from over and the need is only growing,” wrote Fieri on a donations page that benefits The Salvation Army. From chicken to pork loin, baked beans to braised cabbage, his impromptu kitchen has served home cooking to firefighters, evacueesand volunteers in their time of need when many homes have been lost.
Meanwhile in Puerto Rico — and on the heels of his relief efforts in Houston after Hurricane Harvey — D. C.’s José Andrés has stationed himself for more than three weeks.
After Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September, Andrés and his nonprofit, World Central Kitchen, have worked alongside local chefs like José Enrique to churn out dishes from Puerto Rican stew to paella. As of October 17, FEMA confirmed that only 14% of Puerto Rico has electricity. Certain areas still lack food and water, and so Andrés’ World Central Kitchen is staying put until the island is back up and running.
On Tuesday, Andrés tweeted an announcement worth shouting: Their combined efforts officially served 1million hot meals.
Those interested in helping thesemissionscan donate to José Andrés’ World Central Kitchen, and Guy Fieri’s donations page in partnership with The Salvation Army.",0
"If you want to quickly grasp the current proposal in Washington to increase the weight limits on shipping trucks, your first stop should be the zoo.

The ramifications of this in all 50 states would be enormous and the numbers are certainly not on the side of those wanting heavier trucks. If a 14 percent load increase is allowed, we’ll see the rapid deterioration of our already-frayed infrastructure, damage that will ultimately force taxpayers to foot the bill at a time when they’re already subsidizing these heavy trucks.
A U. S. Department of Transportation study has shown that taxpayers already pony up 20 percent of the cost of highway damage caused by trucks weighing 80,000 pounds. Should that limit increase to 91,000 pounds, the taxpayer burden would grow to 50 percent. It’s a simple matter of engineering: If you put more weight on roads, they have to be repaired and upgraded sooner.
Another DOT study, released just this past June, found that if federal truck weights were increased to 91,000 pounds, the added stress to bridges would require either strengthening or replacing about 4,845 bridges at an estimated cost to taxpayers of more than $1.1 billion. That’s on top of the $2.4 billion for damage already done by trucks at the current weight limit of 80,000 pounds. It is important to note that this study only took into account a sample of the nation’s bridges and that the impact of this proposal is likely much larger than quantified by the study. At a time when more than 144,606 — or 24 percent — U. S. bridges are already deficient, can we really afford to make this bad problem worse?
This certainly resonates in Ohio, which has the second largest number of bridges in the country — 44,000 of them, trailing only Texas. We’ve load-rated every bridge in our state, a task that took five years. We did so in the wake of the tragic I-35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis in 2007. We’d have to start that process anew if the load limit were increased, costing Ohio $60 million overnight.
By the way, more than 5,300 of our bridges have been deemed functionally obsolete or structurally deficient and need to be replaced. The funds simply aren’t there. As to our county bridges that still have wooden decks, some of these would have to be posted or closed for the safety of the traveling public. And I surely wouldn’t want to see how long they would last against 91,000 pound vehicles.
Proponents of this legislative proposal will make two arguments, both weak. First they claim that the addition of a sixth axle would ameliorate the damage that the heavier weight would cause. In Ohio, nearly 3 in 4 bridges are long enough that the bridge would bear the entire weight of the truck all at once. It’s fine that the weight is spread more evenly, but that does nothing to ease the strain on a bridge.
The other argument is that the weight increase would apply to the Interstate Highway System, and not every road. If every heavy truck began and ended on an interstate, this distinction would matter. But as we like to say, all travel starts and ends on a local road. You don’t go from Cleveland to New York just on interstates.
For our safety and for the stability of our highways and bridges, let’s leave this 5-ton elephant where he belongs: at the zoo.

"Martha Stewart, Madonna and Nicole Kidman are among those named in leaked Paradise Papers documents
hey are some of the biggest names in entertainment, and all of them make an appearance in the Paradise Papers. Some do so by name, such as the “Ciccone, Madonna” listed in tiny print among the investors of a Bermuda company, while others are there by dint of the offshore entities they have backed.
Some of the celebrities’ interests are historical, others contemporary. Some are similar to those of the singer Shakira, who holds a substantial portion of her showbusiness earnings offshore.
Others such as Justin Timberlake and Nicole Kidman seem more interested in acquiring property in the Bahamas, and may have real estate or privacy reasons for registering companies in those jurisdictions.
Whatever the motive, there is nothing illegal about moving money offshore and nothing to suggest that any of those named below had any unlawful purpose. But the industry has evolved and grown exponentially in recent years – and political and public attitudes to offshore regimes have changed equally dramatically.
The current political climate raises legitimate questions about the actions of wealthy and well-known individuals: what benefit were they hoping for and will they continue to use such vehicles following the Paradise Papers revelations?
The disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein invested in the now-defunct Bermuda-based medical venture capital firm Scientia Health Group Ltd. Weinstein took out 2,000 shares in the company in November 2001, leaked files from the law firm Appleby show.
He gave as his contact point the name of Richard Koenigsberg, one of the directors of the Weinstein Company who last month fired the film mogul after several women accused him of sexual harassment.
It is not known whether Weinstein sold his stake in Scientia before it went out of business. He did not respond to Guardian questions.
The lifestyle guru Martha Stewart was also an investor in Scientia. The company was founded by Samuel Waksal, who at the time was also chief executive of ImClone.
Stewart took out a stake in both of Waksal’s companies. It was her decision to sell about $230,000 (174,000) of shares in ImClone in December 2001, a day before the release of an adverse US Food and Drug Administration ruling, that landed her in insider-dealing trouble, with Stewart and Waksal ending up in prison.
Stewart declined to comment on her historical Bermuda investment.
Tucked away on page 31 of one of the 7m documents contained in the Appleby leak is an entry in tiny print for a company shareholder, listed with her last name followed by first name: Ciccone, Madonna. The suspicion that this report may refer to Madonna Louise Ciccone, better known simply as Madonna, is strengthened by the address given for the holder, the Manhattan offices of Provident Financial Management, which specialises in managing tours and live performances in the music industry and has worked for the “queen of pop”.
Madonna is listed as having bought 2,000 shares in the Bermuda-incorporated company SafeGard Medical Ltd in 1998.
What the star was doing investing in a medical company based in a tax haven remains a mystery, as does whether or not she sold her shares before the entity was dissolved in 2013. While it was active, SafeGard produced medical equipment such as retractable syringes.
The Guardian asked Madonna through her London-based publicist to illuminate the subject, but she did not reply.
In August 2015, the musician and actor Justin Timberlake created a Delaware company with a similar name to his record label Tennman Records. Legal documents contained in the Paradise Papers show the limited liability company was set up with Timberlake as its sole member and his Los Angeles-based accountant, Michael Dreyer, as manager.
The purpose of the company, the documents show, was to “engage in the purchase of real estate” in the Bahamas. Four months after setting it up, Timberlake moved to register the entity as a foreign company in the Bahamas.
Why Timberlake was keen to have a company structure for buying real estate in the Bahamas remains unclear, and the star did not respond to a Guardian request for comment. A clue is provided, perhaps, in another Appleby document showing that a month before the holding was set up, a separate entity called Nexus Luxury Collection Ltd was incorporated in the Bahamas as an “international business company”.
Timberlake is the main partner in Nexus Luxury Collection along with the golfer Tiger Woods and financier Joe Lewis. One of its prime assets is an 18-hole golf course in Albany, a resort community in the Bahamas.
The actor Nicole Kidman and her country musician husband, Keith Urban, registered their joint US-based limited liability company as a foreign entity in the Bahamas in March 2015. Leaked documents show their aim was to secure “ownership of interests in real property” in the tax haven using a portion of their wealth.
If the celebrity couple were to buy and later sell a property on the island, they would be subject to taxation on any increase in its value. Were they to do so as a Bahamian entity, they would face individual levels of US tax on the rise – anything up to 39.6%.
By contrast, setting up a US-based limited liability company and registering it in the Bahamas as they did would allow them to treat the increase in price as capital gains. That way, they would only pay an effective rate of 23.8%.
A spokesman for Kidman and Urban said tax was irrelevant to the way they structured their affairs. The registering of the US company in the Bahamas was solely to comply with local laws and “to hold Bahamian property and protect their family’s privacy. The company is taxed under US law and no special tax advantages accrue to them or the company. They are taxed as if they owned the property directly.”
The Colombian singer-songwriter makes an appearance in the documents under her full name, Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll. The Grammy award-winner, who released her first album when she was 13, is listed as a resident of the Bahamas even though she lives in Barcelona.
She is also the sole shareholder of Tournesol Ltd, a Malta company with 3m in share capital. Malta, the smallest EU member state, has faced accusations that it operates as a tax haven.
The Paradise Papers reveal that in June 2009 Shakira’s “musical assets, intellectual property rights and trademarks” were moved to Tournesol. At the same time the Malta-based business increased its capital with a share premium of 31m following a valuation of those musical assets by the New York consultancy Gelfand, Rennert & Feldman.
The 31m came in the form of an “interest-free loan agreement” from another Shakira entity in Luxembourg named ACE Entertainment. The loan was annulled in 2014.
A lawyer representing the singer told the consortium of journalists working on the Paradise Papers that Tournesol Ltd “fulfils all legal requirements. All of the corresponding information relative to this entity is public and transparent.”
Asked about her listed residence in the Bahamas, the lawyer added that as an international artist Shakira had lived in a variety of places “throughout her professional career and, in every case, has fully met the laws of all the jurisdictions where she has resided”.",0
"CEO pay, which seems to most people to be increasing all out of proportion to the actual value the executives contribute to society, is a big political issue these days. Even some free marketers have been forced to admit that modern CEO pay packets are often, in the immortal words of John Kenneth Galbraith, ""frequently in the nature of a warm personal gesture by the individual to himself.""
One of the things that has made this loving largesse possible is the increasing use of stock options. They have massive tax advantages for corporations, and even better (as far as the board is concerned), they aren't accounted for in the same way as giving the CEO cash or stock outright. Plus, they don't feel exactly like real money, and anyone who has ever visited a retail outlet in a foriegn country knows where that leads.
Stock options are supposed to avoid the principal-agent problem by making executive fortunes rise and fall along with those of the shareholders, but stock options aren't actually the same as the stock held by shareholders. A CEO with a lot of stock loses money whenever the price of the stock falls, and makes money whenever it rises. A CEO with stock options, on the other hand, makes money only if the stock price is above the strike price at which his options entitle him to buy stock; he never loses money. This gives the CEO incentives to take rather more risk than the shareholders might like.
Say a CEO holds 1,000 stock options with a strike price of $60 (meaning he is entitled to buy 100 shares of stock at $60 apiece), and the current stock price is $50.  A scheme with a 30% chance of raising the stock price by $15, but a 50% chance of making it fall by $30, is obviously a bad idea for the shareholders. But it's a great deal for the CEO, who loses nothing if the stock price falls, but makes $5,000 if the scheme pans out.
This point is made by economist Brad DeLong in a post on CEO compensation:
First, at-the-money options do not make CEOs ""long"" their company as much as long the volatility of their company. It's clear that direct ownership of stock--ideally, restricted stock--is a better mechanism for aligning managers' interests with shareholders.   Second, when I looked at the data I thought I saw an important difference between entrepreneurial-CEO-owners (like Bill Gates, with stock) and manager-CEO-nonowners (with options). I think there is an important difference.   Third, we do have a big organizational problem here. We need diversity of ownership--both to raise capital on the scale required for modern business organizations and to spread risk. But once you have diversified ownership, monitoring and supervising managers becomes a public good from the shareholders' perspective, and it is very hard to get market or market-like or indeed voting political mechanisms to adequately supply public goods: the difficulties of collective action by dispersed owners of corporations has been one of the institutional flaws of modern capitalism for more than a century.
His post suggests that the real problem, then, is not CEO's, or even captive corporate boards loyal to the chief executive; the real problem is that shareholders aren't performing assigned roles in management theory. An MBA studying at a free-market school like the University of Chicago learns two basically conflicting things: first, that investors cannot beat the market by picking stocks, and should thus ""passively"" invest their savings in a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks such as an index fund; and secondly, that the owners of a firm (aka the shareholders) must keep the CEO in line. Passive investors, however, don't do this; they don't even sell out the firm unless it is so badly managed that its market capitalisation plummets to the point where it drops out of the index.
The much smaller cohort of institutional investors could perform this oversight function, stopping managerial misbehaviour before it costs shareholders money, but they don't seem particularly keen to take it on. That has left the war for corporate control open to a motley crew of takeover artists, executives, family interests, and ""activist investors"", like public sector pension funds. But many of these use their clout to agitate not for the benefit of the shareholders, or even the pensioners they are charged with caring for, but the pet causes of their political backers. CALPERS, the California pension system, is perhaps the most famous example.
When the CEO is the owner/founder, he compensates for this problem because he is so emotionally and financially invested in the system. But a modern society can't be run on an artisanal basis, as Robert Samuelson pointed out this week. Stock options were supposed to be an inexpensive fix, but as often happens, the theory was confounded by the law of unintended consequences. The good news is, the capitalist system is always ready to go back to the drawing board.",0
"Some of the hottest items for sale today are limited edition or rare sneakers -- footwear that inspire a cult-like following and can fetch prices running into the thousands of dollars -- but federal customs officials say there is a darker side to the trend, as counterfeiters with potential ties to transnational crime and even terrorism have stepped in to feed the demand.
Genuine Yeezys retail for around $200 a pair, but they are so rare and sell out so fast that sneaker speculators will sell them at massive mark-ups through stores like the Magnolia Park in Burbank, California, where a pair of Yeezys can go for as high as $1,500.
“I’ve seen kids come in here with Excel spreadsheets, showing their entire collection and what they’re selling,” said Magnolia Park founder Mike Guerra. “It’s like the stock market. One day it’s worth $500, the next day its $1,000, and just all comes down to how many there are available.”
Thanks in part to this demand, sneakers are one of the most counterfeited commodities coming into the U. S. according to Edward Fox, the Customs and Border Protection's acting port director of the Port of New York and New Jersey in Newark. Mostly in China, giant factories churn out thousands of counterfeits that bear only subtle differences to the genuine models, like minor discrepancies in the threading, color variation, logo placement and even the sole.
Some fakes are so good many consumers are turning to unofficial authenticators online, such as Yeezy Busta, who calls out the fakes daily to his more than half a million followers.
“You walk around L. A. and you’ll see at least 10 people wearing these,” he said, referring to Yeezy sneakers. “Probably eight or nine of them will be fake.”
Yeezy Busta, who said he’s a 19-year-old medical student from Los Angeles but wears a mask to hide his identity because he’s afraid of being sued, offers a Yeezy verification service. For $10, followers can email him photos of their shoes for him to review. Some people know their Yeezys are fake, but don’t care.
There are also plenty of how-to tutorials on YouTube explaining how to check if sneakers are genuine and some buyers knowingly go for fakes to save money.
But authorities say purchasing counterfeit goods is not a victimless crime and can fuel illegal enterprises involved in potentially violent activities.
“Those dollars are not going to some legitimate business those dollars are going to support drug trafficking organizations, organized crime and in some cases terrorist organizations,” said Fox.
Officials say terrorists who attacked the French magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015 financed their weapons partly by selling fake Nike sneakers. U. S. authorities have amped up their efforts in response, seizing more counterfeit goods than ever before.
“Nightline” was embedded with the Los Angeles Police Department as they went on a raid in Inglewood, California. Undercover agents working for Nike had been surveilling a store for months where they said they had bought counterfeit sneakers before and now were bringing in the LAPD in hopes of making arrests.
“Most people, they want to wear items that are known and they don’t really care that they’re counterfeit,” said Det. Ricky Ishitani.
When the LAPD raided the store, the owner was nowhere to be found but they did arrest a female store clerk for selling counterfeit goods.
Police said the clerk cooperated and has not been charged. The store’s owner, an alleged supplier, was later arrested, but has not been charged. Police said the storeroom was packed with fake sneakers and they will pursue charges.
“It was a lot. Hundreds,” Ishitani said. “The whole back end was covered with sneakers.”
It’s not just the West Coast. “Nightline” was there as CBP officers combed through boxes of shipments in New Jersey, rifling through packages to see if they contained counterfeit goods.
CBP partners with other agencies, including the FBI and the DEA, to share intelligence on counterfeit shipments and try to prevent fakes from ever making it to the U. S. in the first place.
“We see counterfeit goods coming from all over the world,” Fox said. “Obviously China is a large manufacturer and so the possibility of there being some volatile merchandise coming out of China is fairly high.”
“An average distributor ... makes anywhere from $80 to $100,000 a month,” Ishitani said. “So that's over $1 million a year. If you’re that guy who sells at a corner of a parking lot ... you're making about $4,000 to $5,000 a month just selling Yeezy shoes.”
And authorities say the punishments if caught are more lenient than for other crimes, such as narcotics trafficking. But it’s where the money is going that worries them the most.
“One thing good about criminals is they take great notes on where the money goes to,” Ishitani said. “So we'll look at [documents], we'll see evidence of Moneygram.”
Last year, the CBP said they seized over $32 million worth of counterfeit goods.
“When you pick up something that is an illegitimate shipment sometimes you'll see the weight it is different,” Fox said. “After you've done this 5,000 times you started to feel for what legitimate Nikes might feel like.”",0

The high-tech ceiling at the entrance to the Museum of the Bible will feature digital images and movies as well as running scripture verses. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  When the $500million Museum of the Bible opens Nov.17 just blocks from Capitol Hill, it won’t promote a specific religion, its leaders say. The museum’s finances tell a different story. Financial documents and interviews reveal a tangled relationship between the nonprofit museum; Hobby Lobby and its owners, the conservative-Christian Green family; and the National Christian Foundation, a donor-advised fund that supports key soldiers in the national battle for conservative Christian values. The Greens and their craft-store empire have donated to the museum and to the foundation. In addition, the foundation and Hobby Lobby are the primary donors to the museum, according to interviews and financial documents. The circular relationship appears to benefit the family and the company, who have enjoyed large tax breaks for supporting their pet project. The murky ties between the three entities have attracted the attention of museum and nonprofit experts who have expressed concern about the project’s political agenda, potential conflicts of interest and compliance with tax laws. These questions come on the heels of Hobby Lobby’s agreement this summer to pay a $3million fine and forfeit thousands of artifacts that federal authorities said were smuggled out of Iraq.  The museum’s leaders play down their connections to conservative Christian causes. “The museum’s role is not to espouse faith,” said Steve Green, president of Hobby Lobby. “We just want to present the facts of this book ... to celebrate this book. We want the visitor to make their own decision.”  [Sneak peek: D. C.’s new museum includes lots of tech — but not a lot of Jesus]  Hobby Lobby is the family company that successfully challenged the federal government’s mandate to provide contraception services to its employees as part of the Affordable Care Act. The National Christian Foundation, a Georgia-based organization with a mission “to advance God’s Kingdom,” distributes millions of dollars annually to churches and civic organizations, including many engaged in court fights against same-sex marriage, abortion rights and other social policies.
The Biblical Garden on the roof of the museum offers views of the city. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  Almost two-thirds of the museum’s $557million in contributions comes from these two sources, according to interviews and recent tax filings. Because nonprofit groups are not required to disclose their donors, it’s unclear how much of the total donations are tied to the Greens. What is clear is the craft store and the museum are deeply connected through gifts and various business deals that shuttle funds between the two for rent, administrative and curatorial services. “There’s a lot of room for conflicts of interest,” said John E. Simmons, a museum consultant and president of the Collections Stewardship Professional Network of American Alliance of Museums. “The code of ethics for the American Alliance of Museums says you should avoid conflicts of interest and also the appearance of conflicts of interest.” “They clearly view this as an evangelical outpost to Congress,” said Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, who sees the museum as an attempt “to redefine religious liberty and redo our history.” Green would not disclose how much he has contributed to the museum. “We don’t say,” Green said during a 15-minute interview at the museum. “Those are decisions the family makes, and I’m not at liberty to share. If I knew, I wouldn’t (share), but I don’t know specifically.”  [Hobby Lobby’s Steve Green has big plans for this Bible museum]  The museum’s tax records show Hobby Lobby donated $201million in artifacts, about 2,800 of the Green’s 40,000-piece collection. The family and company have given more through NCF. “A lot of funding we give, whether it be here or to others, we go through NCF,” Green continued.  The National Christian Foundation directed more than $163million between 2013 and 2015 to the museum for “Christian discipleship,” according to the foundation’s tax returns. An NCF spokesman said the foundation’s donor privacy policy prohibits it from disclosing the names — or the number — of donors who have directed gifts to the museum. “Museum of the Bible is one of the thousands of charities that we support through our grantmaking,” spokesman Steve Chapman wrote in an email. “Much of their support comes from grant recommendations from donors using their Giving Funds.” The museum’s most recent audits show 89percent of all donations last year and 96percent of all donations the previous year came from one entity, which museum president Cary Summers identified as NCF. Most large gifts come through NCF, Summers said, adding that the museum has 50,000 donors in all. Museum officials declined to provide a list of its donors. “We get checks in the mail, we get money in an envelope from Sunday school classes and churches. The larger gifts, they normally go through NCF,” Summers said. “Fifty-thousand is a big number,” added Green. “Many ministries would never even have that many total supporters, and we’re just starting.”  [Museum of the Bible to offer free admission]  The substantial support from the Greens and their company has legal experts questioning the museum’s status as a public charity and the increased tax benefits that accompany that status. To be a public charity, a nonprofit must show it receives at least one-third of its funding from many donors, including the general public, government agencies and private foundations. (A private foundation, on the other hand, typically has a single major source of funding.) Nonprofit corporations want to be classified as public charities rather than private foundations because their donors receive larger tax deductions for their gifts. “There’s some more tax advantages, yeah,” Green said about the museum’s status as a public charity. “If we make a donation, we’re going to use that as a write-off. We wouldn’t be good stewards if we didn’t.” Gifts made through a donor-advised fund like NCF are automatically characterized as public contributions. “This enables a crazy loophole in which every private foundation founder could, by use of a willing donor-advised fund sponsor, always ensure that their foundation qualifies as a public charity,” said Brian Galle, a Georgetown Law professor.
The entrance to the museum features relief metal lettering of scriptures in Latin. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  Many donor-advised funds have policies that prevent this loophole. Fidelity Charitable, for example, will not approve a grant where “Fidelity Charitable provides a substantial portion of the organization’s public support,” according to its online guidelines. The NCF’s guidelines do not include such language. Chapman did not respond to several messages seeking information about foundation guidelines. The IRS can examine the arrangement, Galle said. “NCF is essentially a straw in this transaction, and the way we know that they are a straw is that reputable donor-advised funds refuse to do this,” Galle said. “They recognize that if the loophole were widely exploited, it might lead to congressional action.” Hobby Lobby and the museum are also involved in several business deals. Despite creating the museum, the craft company retains ownership of most of its 40,000-item collection. The museum rents storage space from Hobby Lobby in Oklahoma City to keep and care for these items, and in a separate agreement, Hobby Lobby pays the museum for curatorial services, according to tax filings. “They are leasing space from people who are paying them to care for their collection? I find that odd,” Simmons said, adding that such dealings could block accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums. A museum must be open for two years before it can apply for AAM accreditation. The ties between the museum and its funders only matter if the donor has control over content, said Sally Yerkovich, director of the Institute for Museum Ethics. “Museums are working more and more toward being transparent,” she said. “The issue is whether the donors actually influence what the museum is doing. That will be apparent once they open.” Green is confident that any expectations about proselytizing will disappear. “It’s kind of like a movie reviewer reviewing a movie before seeing it,” he said. “You might want to check us out before making those claims, and see if we’ve done our job well.”",0
"Charlotte, NC — NBA Commissioner Adam Silver held a press conference today, announcing that Charlotte, North Carolina will no longer be hosting the 2017 All-Star game due to the state’s recent passing of the anti-LGBT law HB2.
“With this new law in place, Charlotte currently does not have any anti-discrimination protection in place, something that would be vital for a large event such as the All-Star Game,” Silver told reporters. “We are giving the state of North Carolina 30 days to repeal this law or they can expect the 2017 All-Star game to be held elsewhere. I want to make it clear that the NBA will not stand for this type of intolerance and hate.”
Silver’s comments come just weeks after the North Carolina legislature passed HB2, the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, which requires transgender people (and everyone else) to use public restrooms according to the biological sex on their birth certificate. The new law also strips North Carolina workers of the ability to sue under a state anti-discrimination law, a right that has been upheld in court since 1985.
“If you were fired because of your race, fired because of your gender, fired because of your religion,” said Allan Freyer, head of the Workers’ Rights Project at the North Carolina Justice Center in Raleigh, “You no longer have a basic remedy.”
Since Governor Pat McCrory signed HB2 into law last month, well over 1,000 jobs have been moved out of state, and over 100 companies, including Facebook, Apple, Paypal, Pyramid Country and StopPack, have expressed concern or anger, warning they may move or cancel plans to expand, costing the state millions of dollars. In addition to that, by not hosting the 2017 NBA All-Star game, the state stands to lose even more. It is uncertain the exact figure, but in 2014, the All-Star game in New Orleans generated $106.1 Million and in 2015, New York generated approximately $195 million in economic activity.
On Friday, Bruce Springsteen cancelled his concert in Greensboro because of North Carolina’s controversial new LGBT bill stating, “With deepest apologies to our dedicated fans in Greensboro, we have canceled our show scheduled for Sunday, April 10th. Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry — which is happening as I write — is one of them. It is the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards.”
Earlier this week, a women’s advocacy group, UltraViolet, began circulating an online petition urging Nike and PepsiCo — two chief sponsors of previous NBA All-Star weekends — to not support the 2017 event if it is held in Charlotte. There is also a new campaign in North Carolina encouraging people to call McCrory’s office every time they use a public restroom to report on their compliance with the law.
North Carolina has become a fierce battleground for culture war issues. Since the GOP captured the legislature in 2010 and the governorship in 2012, there’s been a steady stream of conservative changes, from much stricter voter laws to looser gun laws to overhauling taxes. The legislature even considered a proposal to establish Christianity as the official state religion.
Marina Mangiaracina, a transgender individual, who is a journalist for SB Nation, does not agree with the new law.
“First of all, no one carries around their birth certificate. How is a cop going to check what gender a person has on that document? Second of all, the policy of refusing to change the gender on your birth certificate until you have sex reassignment surgery is dangerous. Not all trans people need, want, or can afford sexual reassignment surgery. It’s an extremely delicate and risky procedure that costs anywhere from $7,000 to $50,000. Not to mention all of the missed work in the weeks of recovery. Forcing, or even encouraging transgendered people to have that surgery is sickening. If the person wants the surgery, that’s one thing. But not everybody can afford that surgery. It simply discriminates against the poor.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that the new law needs to be repealed.
“This is a ridiculous law that makes absolutely no sense,” Bradley said. “According to the law, a transgender man, a person with a vagina but has male features, such as a beard, now has to go into the women’s bathroom. Then the police get called. How exactly do they verify what’s going on there? Does the transgender man have to drop his pants or is that person required to be carrying their birth certificate at all times? And according to the idiots behind this law, it’s about stopping sexual predators. How? Is it really that hard for a man to put on a wig and a Hillary suit and go into the women’s restroom? No. This law is about bigotry, hate, intolerance and taking away human rights from the LGBT community.”
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, told ABC News that his wife Barbara is transgender.
“Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the surgery my wife Barbara wanted; her name actually used to be Ted,” Mikkleson laughs, “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, look at this article we wrote about Scientology supposedly losing its tax-exempt status. What is the name of the person or website responsible for the hoax? We claim to know it, since we list the website’s disclaimer; but no real information is there. We even go as far as saying the site that started the story spreads malware and viruses, but we don’t say what website it is. I think warning people about a website that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but that’s a lot of work and people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? And lots of people complain, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours.” Mikkelson breaks down in tears, “Anyway, about my transgender wife Barbara; so brave.”
Paul Horner, owner of the Phoenix Suns, told ABC News he approves of the NBA’s decision but believes more should be done.
“I applaud the NBA in taking a stand against this type of discrimination and pulling the All-Star game from Charlotte. Furthermore, I believe it’s time for Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan to take a stand against this law and move the team out of that backwards state.”
At this time, unless the North Carolina legislature repeals HB2, it is unclear where the 2017 All-Star game will be held.",1
"Five Texas prisons have evacuated nearly 6,000 inmates since Saturday due to catastrophic flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey.
At approximately midnight on Tuesday in Fort Bend County, 1,400 inmates at the Jester 3 and Carol S. Vance prison units began boarding buses to be moved out of affected areas. They will be relocated to other Texas Department of Criminal Justice facilities, Robert Hurst, a TDCJ spokesman told NBC News. Fort Bend County is located just southwest of Houston.
Those inmates join an estimated 4,500 others who were evacuated on Saturday from Terrell, Stringfellow and Ramsey prison units in Brazoria County, which is located south of Houston along the Texas coast.
Officials began the evacuations because the five prisons are at risk of flooding due to their proximity to the rising Brazos River, according to the Facebook post.
As of 10 a.m. on Tuesday, it was not immediately clear if the Jester 3 and Carol S. Vance units had finished being evacuated.
“We’re moving them to other facilities where there is not any risk,” Hurst said. “At this time there have been no complications and things are going smoothly.”
Hurst said there have been no issues with overcrowding as the inmates are moved from areas inundated with rain from Harvey to secure locations.
“We are making sure everybody is safe and that it’s a secure operation. We’re not taking any risk with what we’re having to do but at this time things are going smoothly,” Hurst said.
Hurst said the inmates are being transferred to the TDCJ facilities aboard buses used for standard prison situations. The inmates are accompanied by correctional officers during the transport, the TDCJ said on Facebook.
Because of the historic flooding, which has killed at least four people so far and left nearly 300,000 without power, it is not clear when the inmates will be returned to their facilities.
“We’ve got to wait for the storm to pass and wait for other situations to resolve themselves before we look into that,” Hurst said.
On Tuesday, Harris County Sheriff's Office tweeted that their jail hadn't been evacuated. Harris County, which encompasses Houston, has seen some of the most significant flooding from Harvey.
The sheriff's office said that inmates had access to phones in order to check on loved ones.",0
"We can get a sofa made “in time for Christmas” and broadband companies are offering upgrades to cope with Black Friday (God help us). Yes, the hell that is the commercial run-up to Christmas is upon us.
Nothing demonstrates to me the vast gulf between our government and the most impoverished and excluded members of society than its decision to roll out the new six-weeks-in-arrears universal credit benefit exactly now. Did the dreadful timing (rubbing people’s noses in this exclusion) occur to anybody in authority? (Editorial).
I understand the pressure to give your family the best Christmas or, indeed, any Christmas. Parents know how those who don’t get the right – or any – gift can be mocked or bullied by their better-off peers on their return to school. We hear the siren calls of the short-term loan TV ads, featuring interest rates over 1,000%, to “restore some order” to our lives.
Sadly, for far too many, this will not be the happy time it is supposed to be, but a new circle of hell in which they may still be paying for this Christmas by the time the next one comes along.

In drawing timely attention to the effects of an underfunded National Health Service (Editorial), you understandably conclude that “the worst could yet be to come’’. There are, however, welcome signs that local campaigning against the government’s cuts is obliging Conservative MPs to think twice before voting for further austerity.
A positive development is the nationwide Health Campaigns Together conference in London on Saturday 4 November. Mrs May has already been forced once (when meeting the demands of the DUP) to reveal the existence of her “magic money tree’’. We must now all oblige her to shake it again on behalf of the NHS.

It was good to read Will Hutton blazing against Nigel Lawson, now seeking to disinter the putrefied remains of Thatcherism in the context of Brexit. (“They’re back, as wrong as ever. Enough of Lawson and his band of 80s ultras”, Comment). With such zombie acolytes as Redwood, Lilley and Lamont, and in the wider context of cabinet ineptitude, the myth-making sorcerers of the Tory right are again on the rampage.
Draining the lingering Thatcher/Lawson poison from our political and social bloodstream, however, now requires a move beyond the rehearsal of the many individual policy areas through which it has undermined progress and cohesion in our society.
It’s time for these damaging, high social-cost factors to be seen not merely as regrettable elements of policy, but as the inescapable outcomes of the overarching, quasi-religious orthodoxies that have blighted much of our hard-won freedoms since 1979.
Michael Sandel put it most cogently in his 2012 What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets: “As a result, without quite realising it, without ever deciding to do so, we have drifted from having a market economy into being a market society.” We must not allow re-entry to Lawson and his acolytes.

Peter Preston complains that in a recent article I “zealously” pursued “events of 2003-7” and dwelt on “a sleazy episode from a decade ago” (phone hacking) (“Phone hacking was terrible, but there are greater threats online”, Media). This is strange, since the article in question made no reference to either 2003-7 or phone hacking. Instead, it sought to correct several factual errors made just this month by Karen Bradley, the media secretary, as she tried to justify plans to overturn parliament’s backing for the effective, independent regulation of news publishing.
Preston is right about one thing: the future matters most. As it happens, high-standard, truly independent regulation offers the best hope for the future of journalism, counteracting fake news and shoddy practice by making publishers genuinely accountable for inaccuracies, whether in print or online. In this way, it can help rebuild precious trust among readers, something that will never be achieved by sham regulation or by sweeping yesterday’s failures under the carpet.

"Regardless of how old you are, how much money you make or when you plan to retire, the chances are you’re experiencing at least a little stress about saving for retirement. It’s a concern many young people avoid altogether, but as you grow older, it becomes harder to ignore.
About one in three Americans has no retirement savings whatsoever, and 56 percent of Americans have $10,000 or less put away. Since most people would need several hundred thousand dollars or more to retire comfortably, it’s understandable that many are currently stressed.
But let’s take a look at the causes of those stressors, and what you can do — right now — to alleviate your own burden.",0
"Jeanne Brousse said she did not know any Jews before she began rescuing them as a young clerk at her local prefecture in Nazi-occupied France.
“I felt horrified by the atrocious fate likely to befall all these innocent victims whose only ‘mistake’ was to have been born Jewish,” she once told the historian Martin Gilbert. “I was determined to find solutions so that the greatest number of those who came to me could be saved.”
Mrs. Brousse, who in 1973 was named Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, died Oct.19 at a nursing home in Annecy, the Alpine town near the Swiss border where she conducted her lifesaving wartime work. She was 96.
Her son Denis Brousse confirmed her death and said he did not yet know the cause.
As one of the Righteous Among the Nations, Mrs. Brousse was among the more than 26,000 gentiles recognized by Yad Vashem for having risked their safety, while seeking no reward, to save Jewish lives during the Holocaust.
In an account of her deeds, Yad Vashem described Mrs. Brousse as having been “known by Jews living [in] or near Annecy ... as someone to turn to in time of need.” That need became most dire after September1943, when Italy, which had occupied Annecy and had largely refused Nazi demands for the deportation of Jews, abandoned the Axis to join the Allies.
Under German control, the Jews of Annecy and elsewhere in France faced imminent and mortal danger.
Mrs. Brousse, then JeanneMaurier, credited her Catholic faith with giving her the courage to confront her own dangers as a rescuer.
“I was faced with a number of painful, tragic situations,” Gilbert quoted her as saying in his book “The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust.” “Nothing was organized at the beginning. We had to find individual solutions case by case — quickly. It was so risky. My family and I were faced with impossible problems, and we had to think of ideas, subterfuge and ruses.”
Yad Vashem credited Mrs. Brousse with using her access to prefecture materials to provide ration cards and false identification documents for Jews seeking to escape detection by Germans or French collaborators.
Working with the French resistance, she helped find hiding places, particularly for Jewish children. Among those children were Franoise, Nicole and Danielle Schilli, daughters of a French rabbi, Henri Schilli, who survived the war and testified to YadVashem of Mrs. Brousse’s works.
Using her government contacts, she learned and warned Jews of impending roundups and helped them flee to the neutral territory of Switzerland.
Approximately 77,000 Jews residing in French territory died in the Holocaust, most of them at Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp located in occupied Poland, according to the U. S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Gilbert wrote “several dozen families owed their escape” to Mrs. Brousse.
Jeanne Elise Maurier was born in Saint-Pierre-de-Curtille, near Annecy, on April12, 1921.
Her mother was a homemaker, and her father worked at the prefecture.
Jeannette, as she was known, was preparing to enroll in nursing school in Paris when the war broke out. Her son said she began her rescue work when a French Jew approached her, knowing she worked at the prefecture, and with utmost discretion asked for her help.
In 1944, after her region of France was liberated, she married Jean Brousse, also a local government employee.
He died in 2003. Their daughter, Claudie Brousse, died in her teens. Survivors include two sons, Michel Brousse of Lyon, France, and Denis Brousse of Smithville, N. J.; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
Denis Brousse said his mother did not speak about her rescue work until the 1970s, when she received her Yad Vashem recognition. Later in life, she participated in public discussions about the Holocaust and the ongoing threats of anti-Semitism.
“Our first duty consists in overcoming our self-centeredness — to inconvenience oneself, to deprive oneself — when one of our human brethren is in danger,” Mordecai Paldiel, the former director of Yad Vashem’s Department of the Righteous, once quoted her as saying, “whoever he may be, from wherever he may come.”",0
"Should you buy or dump shares of electric-car maker Tesla?
On Wall Street, there's no easy answer. That's because a torrid love-hate relationship currently exists between investors and Tesla (TSLA), the maker of revolutionary electric cars. The stock torments Wall Street analysts for a variety of reasons, one of which is that the company continues to fail to meet its targets or promises, much less analysts' expectations.
Those who are opposed to buying Tesla's stock are rabid and passionate in their criticism, questioning whether the company will be able to profitably build the new, lower-cost Model 3 sedan. The few bulls still standing are adjusting their estimates to reflect delays and Tesla's missed goals, insistently noting that the positive long-term outlook isn't really changing.
That hardly reassures the skeptics.
""Tesla executives' conviction levels concerning the Model 3's production stands in stark contrast to the previous quarter,"" argued Toni Sacconaghi, analyst at Bernstein Securities, one of the most savvy technology analysts on Wall Street. ""Tesla's third-quarter results reinforced our concerns,"" he added.
Its guidance of ""lower auto gross margins in the fourth quarter also was of concern, since the company previously stated that gross margins would improve sequentially in the fourth quarter,"" he added.
So he views Tesla as a ""show me story,"" with its ""low margin visibility, a high rate of cash burn and production concerns."" Sacconaghi has lowered his earnings estimate for Tesla and reiterated his ""market-perform"" rating for its stock, with a price target of $265 a share.
Tesla's stock has been on the ropes despite the stock market's exuberant advance this year. Trading at $383 a share in late June, close to its 52-week high of $389, the stock has tumbled since, currently trading at $306.
""Patience"" is what Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk asks of analysts and shareholders, arguing that the Model 3 production delay ""is a relatively small shift,"" considering that the car ""is a 10-year program, and we are talking about a few months out of a 10-year program.""
That has hardly convinced the doubters, however, and gave more fuel to some of the Tesla bears' negative arguments.
Efraim Levy, equity analyst at CFRA, reiterated his ""sell"" rating on Tesla, noting that the adjusted third-quarter per-share loss was larger than what many analysts had expected and that revenues missed the consensus estimate -- and that Tesla missed his gross margin forecast.
But the dire third-quarter results weren't make or break, Levy pointed out, and he doesn't think that Tesla has been derailed, but only delayed. ""Still, we see greater pressure on Tesla to meet its one-quarter delayed weekly run-rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles produced per week by the end of the first quarter"" of 2018, Levy said.
Levy expects Tesla to continue losing money: For 2017, he forecasts the loss rising to $6.25 a share, up from last year's loss of $4.68. He acknowledges that Tesla's story of ""innovative electric vehicles with industry-leading all-electric driving range and strong safety reviews is appealing."" And that the company's ""unique business model and technological leadership give it a margin advantage over peers."" But that hasn't changed his ""sell"" recommendation on the stock.
Also rating Tesla a ""sell"" is Colin Langan, equity analyst at UBS, who has a price target of $185 a share. He noted in a recent report that Tesla's cash burn has accelerated in the third quarter as the Model 3's production has again suffered delays. Tesla pushed back the Model 3 ramp from the fourth quarter to the end of the first quarter of next year.
So Langan lowered his 2017 earnings estimate from a loss of $6.40 a share to a loss of $8.85 ""to reflect the third-quarter miss and the weak fourth-quarter margin outlook."" He also lowered his estimates for next year ""to reflect weaker margins in the first half [of 2018] with the slower Model 3 ramp.""
The Tesla bulls, however, remain undeterred. There were ""a few Model 3 hiccups, but that's not exactly a shocker,"" said Alexander E. Potter, analyst at Piper Jaffray, who rates the stock as ""overweight,"" with a price target of $362 a share. The third-quarter results ""were a bit choppy,"" is how Potter described them. But that with all the noise, he said, he doesn't believe ""any downward pressure on the stock will be sustained.""
Potter expects gross margins to bounce back to the mid-20s by late 2018, ""once Model 3 production stabilizes,"" he said.
Robert Chira, analyst at Guggenheim Securities, is another bull who rates Tesla a ""buy,"" with a price target of $430 a share. ""One quarter Model 3 push-out should not impact long-term leverage,"" he argued. ""We continue to forecast meaningful scaling of EPS [earnings per share] toward nearly $14 in 2019 and $20 in 2020,"" Chira said. And he continues to ""forecast total vehicle volumes ramping up to 300,000 in 2018, 550,000 in 2019 and 750,000 in 2020.""
But apart from production problems, Tesla also faces many other challenges, including a possible stripping of tax breaks for people buying electric vehicles. For example, the House Republican tax plan includes a provision that repeals the ""Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit.""
However, that's still just a proposal in a tax plan that may possibly change substantially -- or even fail to get passed. Of course, this additional uncertainty doesn't make our original question any easier to answer.",0
"Barely two weeks into his presidency,Emmanuel Macronwas confronted by an angry factory worker on the streets of Bellac in central France.
The man was demanding the government save his job at the GM&S auto components plant in the nearby town of La Souterraine. Such encounters are fast becoming a leitmotif of the Macron era: The worried worker could have come from theWhirlpool plant in Amiens, theSTX shipyard in Saint-Nazaireor the Dunkirk-based maker of construction machinery, Tim SA.
While the president has insisted all along that he has no magic solution to France’s industrial woes, he promised “concrete measures” to help the workers in La Souterraine. Now it’s crunch time. Government aid has kept the plant open and workers paid through the end of August. A court will rule next week on whether to allow the only bidder to take over the factory.
For all the 39-year-old president’s appeals to entrepreneurs and technologists to come and invent the future in France, it’s his ability to deal with the past that may shape his legacy. Even as he promotes France as a “start-up nation,” echoes of the past reverberate across the country, in factories like GM&S where aging workers operate dusty, antiquated machinery, frozen in time by a labor code that was first drawn up over a century ago.
“We are damaged goods,” said 54-year-old Alain Dubois, who’s worked at GM&S since he was a teenager. “Look at us: men over 50 with families, mortgages, and few skills beyond what we’ve learned here, in a small region with few possibilities.”
It’s people in Dubois’s position who encapsulate the dilemma at the heart of Macron’s sometimes contradictory vision for France: the former investment banker wants market forces to drive the euro zone’s second-largest economy up to the same level as Germany; but his government is shielding some workers from the market’s logic, wary of the populist anger that he faced during the presidential election.
While Macron won more than 66 percent against the nationalistMarine Le Penin the final round, many voters abstained or spoiled their ballots in protest at the choice they were offered, a warning of just how many people might line up against the president if he fails to deliver.
Withbusiness confidenceat a six-year high yet hispoll numbers indecline, the youngest French leader since Napoleon is betting he’d lose more from letting plants like GM&S die than by sending mixed signals to investors.
“He knows there is a symbolic dimension to fighting for industries and workers,”Jerome Fourquet, the head of pollster Ifop, said by phone. “It’s part of the French spirit, of its patriotic mythology.”
GM&S Industry was once a buoyant, family-owned metal stamping plant making front bumpers, oil pans and tractor cabins in the hills of central France, where cows outnumber people. With 600 employees in the 1990s, it was the biggest employer in the region of La Creuse and is still the second biggest, though it has less than half the workers. After two decades of revolving door management and little training or machine upgrades, the company is threatened with closure.
“We are not the problem,” says Dubois’s colleague, 50-year-old Fifi Lester. “It’s the failure to anticipate changes that were inevitable for people like us and for industries like ours.”
Macron’s effort to revamp the French economy begins with the labor market. He’s aiming to unveil a planthis week to ease restrictions on working hours, put limits on severance pay and simplify labor relations. At the same time, his 2018 budget will cut public spending by 20 billion euros ($23.6 billion) even as he lowers taxes on business. And for next year he’s slated an overhaul of professional training.
But none of that will help Dubois and his friends. Unemployment across France is above 9 percent and in La Creuse nearly half of job seekers have been out of work for at least a year.
“We are late, so late to put France on the right path,” says Jean-Baptiste Moreau, a lawmaker from Macron’s party who represents the region of 120,000 people in the National Assembly. “Until now we’ve been firefighting, with no overall plan.”
Germany introduced programs to help factory workers upgrade their technological know-how in 2010, bolstering its position as Europe’s leading industrial force as France stagnated. French industry’s share of gross domestic product has dropped to 13 percent from 20 percent in 1980, according to the industry employers group, and the sector has lost more than 330,000 jobs since 2008 alone.
To be sure, French investment in machinery is accelerating, driven by the automotive industry, which now has just over nine robots for every 100 workers—the second-highest ratio in the European Union, according to the International Federation of Robotics. But in Germany there are almost 12, and across manufacturing industry as a whole, France lags its European competitors. Small companies like GM&S don’t have the resources to invest like auto giants PSA and Renault.
There is another side to life in La Creuse that epitomizes the hopes that Macron and Moreau have for the region. From the middle of a cattle field, 37-year-old Caroline Barthelemy runs Nataquashop, an online professional swimwear retailer that she started in 2009. She now has 15 employees and 2 million euros a year in sales, shipping bathing suits around the world.
“It’s not a problem of money in France, but of organization—it’s too complex, too regulated,” said Barthelemy, a mother of twin boys. “What matters more than any reform right now is a change of mindset.”
Macron’s risk is that the shuttering of GM&S, and plants like it, could tear up the social fabric of small towns across France before his economic reforms have a chance to spur more businesses like Barthelemy’s.
The only bidder to emerge for the plant, rival auto-parts maker GMD, is proposing to keep on just 120 of the 277 workers employed there currently, though it has pledged to spend millions refitting the factory. The workers say it needs to diversify beyond the auto industry to prosper.
The Whirlpool plant in Amiens, where Macron faced the acid test of his campaign, offers an encouraging precedent. After the previous owner shifted production of washing machines and dryers to cheaper facilities in Poland, the factory was bought by private investor Nicolas Decayeux, who plans to use it as a testing center for a new wave of domestic products such as Internet-connected fridges. Of the 290 permanent workers in Amiens, 277 will keep their jobs.
“It’s going to be tough,” says Lester, who’s worked alongside Dubois at GM&S since 1987. “Are we really going to reinvent ourselves now? I feel ready to take on a challenge, to learn, though maybe not to move away. But if I can be honest, I am afraid.”",0
"The Israel Security and Intelligence Service (Mossad) has announced the establishment of Libertad - a technology innovation fund.
Libertad, the Technological Innovation Fund of the Israel Security and Intelligence Service, was established to provide an innovative capability for maintaining and developing the Mossad's technological superiority by connecting to cutting-edge civilian tech startups.
For the first time in its history, the Mossad is outsourcing its R&D projects. The covert organization is looking for companies and entrepreneurs in the following areas: robotic technologies in the fields of flexible robotics, biomimetics (the creation of new materials), miniaturized systems, all-terrain capabilities and silencing solutions, for land, sea, and air.
ISRAEL SECURITY CHIEF: TECH PREVENTED MORE THAN 2,000 'LONE-WOLF' TERROR ATTACKS LAST YEAR
The organization released a video that demonstrates how it hopes to integrate innovative technologies such as automatic methods for summarizing documents, cataloging, extracting entities and semantic connections, using techniques such as machine learning, in Hebrew and other languages.
In a statement released Tuesday the organization explained why it chose the name ""Libertad"", as it translates from Latin as ""freedom"". “This is the principle on which the fund we created is based: the freedom of companies and entrepreneurs in the Startup Nation to create innovative and groundbreaking technology with our help, and the Mossad's freedom to realize this bridge with technological innovation,” it said.
According to the statement, anyone can apply for the $500,000 fund. Identity of the applicants and companies will be kept secret. The five companies that will be selected will need to hand over the intellectual property rights during the funded program.
Additional areas of interest of the Mossad will be released from time to time as calls for proposals in the framework of Libertad.",0
"Alicia Munnell wants to make one thing clear. Social Security is not going bankrupt. The program that the economistcalls “the most valuable component of our retirement system” is a sustainable system and can be fixed. Americahas just been avoiding the hard choices it has to make if it wants to keep Social Securityaround for future generations.
Munnell, who worked at theFederal Reserve Bank of Boston for 20 years, the Treasury Department for two years during the Clintonadministration
, and served on a U. S. Social Security Advisory Board in 2015, is director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.She has parsed just about every argument for how to resetSocial Security’s finances. In a recent conversation and paper,Munnell, 74, laid out the stark choices Americans face, and the solutions suggested by two diametrically opposed pieces of legislation.
We all know Social Security has long-term cash-flow issues. How would you describe the challenge?
It’s a very simple system. It’s not like the health-care system, where you have insurance companies and doctors andpatients.This is money in, money out. The recent  Social Security trustee’s report  said the same exact thing it’s said almost every year since 1992 or 1993. Wehave a deficit—it’s a little bigger now than in the past—that’sequivalent to 2percent to 3percent of taxable payrolls, and we need to fix it. Every year the actuaries tell us there’s a deficit;every year as a nation we do nothing. It’s very easy to put off making changes for something that won’t happen. You really won’t see anything until the trust fund actually is exhausted in 2034. At that point, benefits have to be cutor revenueincreased, because the system is not allowed to pay out money that it does not have.By the way, when peopletalk about how the Social Security deficit will lead to big increases in the budget deficit, well, Social Securitycan’t run a deficit. When people say that, either they don’t understand how the law works or are trying to create alarm about the system.
One misperception about Social Security is that itshould be enough to live on, which was never really the intent. How much income does it actually replace for workers?
The current level of tax revenues coming in mean that the replacement rate—benefits relative to preretirement earnings—would drop from 36 percent for the typical 65-year-old worker right before the trust fund is exhausted to about 27 percent by2070. Thats a level we last saw in the 1950s. Right now, the replacement rate is already set to decrease from 39 percent to 36 percentfor those claiming Social Security benefits at age 65. Thats because of the gradual increase in full retirement age, from 65to 67, that was part of the legislation in 1983.
You describe two proposals out there as good “bookends” to consider when looking at ways to get rid of the deficit facing Social Security. Where do you stand on that?I like the proposals as bookends because they areso different,they don’t compromise at all. One is all on the benefit side, just big benefit cuts. The other says it would enhance benefits a little and makebig tax increases. And those are the two ways to go. They highlight the notion that we should really decide politically—and I don’t know quite how we do this—what share of the solution Americans want in benefit cuts, and what share they want in tax increases.It’s not really arguing about the specific provisions—should we change the inflation indexing tothe  Consumer Price Index for the Elderly , the CPI–E [an inflation measure geared to rising costs faced by the elderly, such as medical expenses]. The big question: Is this program important enough to people that we as a nation want to pay upand maintain current benefit levels, or are people willing to split the reform between benefit cuts and tax increases somehow.
Surveys say that Americans want—and this is my instinct—to pretty much maintain current benefit levels. When I look at how much money, or how little money, people have in 401(k) plans, I just don’t see any other sources of retirement income out there. So I’d argue for fixing it on the revenue side. But I do believe in democracy, and if the American people writ large want to do it on the other side, in benefit cuts, we should do it.
The first proposal you analyzed in a recent paper was legislation proposed lastyear by Representative Sam Johnson, a Republican from Texas who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee. What does he propose?The  Johnson proposal  wants to cut benefits sharply so that the reduced benefits match the current income for the program. He would raise the age when you can collect full benefits to 69, cut benefits for above-average income earners, and reduce cost of living adjustments (COLAs) for people making more than $85,000 ($170,000 for couples). For those who would get COLAs, he would use a  chain-weighted  Consumer Price Index. [Thatindex “employs aformula that reflects the effect of substitution that consumers make across item categories in response to changes in relative prices,” according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics website.]
What would the impact of that be on average Americans?
I looked at the ratio of proposed to current benefits at different points on the earnings scale. Since doing away with COLAs has a bigger impact as retirees age, I looked at individuals who were 85 years-old. It has no impact on the benefits of lower earners. But medium earners—which I calculate as having an income of $49,121—would see benefits cut to 77 percent of what they would get under current law. [That would befor someone born in 1995, turning 85 in 2080.] Those making $118,500 would get 34 percent of what they would get under today’s benefit schedule.
What does the other proposal, from Representative John Larson, the Connecticut Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee,suggest?
His proposal, a few years old,has some small enhancements to benefits and two big revenue changes. He would raise the total payroll tax paid by employers and employeesby 0.1 percent a year until it reaches 14.8 percent in 2042.And he would have the payroll tax apply to earnings over $400,000. The current cap on wages that the payroll tax is appliedto is $127,200. [The current gap between $127,000 and $400,000 would not be subject to payroll tax.]
It would also use a different measure of inflation when adjusting benefits—theCPI-E. This rises faster than the inflation measure used now, the CPI-W, the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. Theincome threshold for the taxation of Social Security benefits would be raised. [The threshold at whicha portion of one’s Social Security benefit gets taxed hasn’t been adjusted since 1984. It is $25,000 for singles and $32,000 for married couples.] Larsonwould raise it to $50,000 for singles and $100,000 for marrieds.His proposal would also increase the “special minimum benefit” that goes to long-term low earners or people with sporadic work histories.
Are there proposals out there now that advocate for a middle ground betweenthe two proposals?
No. But you could do it. You just raise payroll taxes by half as much and cuts by half as much. There are infinite ways of doing it, and no new ideas particularly. This is a solvable problem. We can’t solve other things, but this should be easy.",0
"China appears set today to end its controversial, decades-long practice of harvesting organs from the bodies of prisoners executed by the state, according to state-run media.
“Starting from January 1, China will end its reliance on the organs of executed prisoners for transplantation,” the Chinese vice minister of health said in early December in a rare admission of the long-secret practice. ""Organ donations will only come from the public and voluntary organ donations will become the only organ donation source.”
But Sophie Richardson, China Director for Human Rights Watch, was skeptical the Government pronouncement would bring about any real change.
“HRW welcomes this policy, but as is the case with many good-on-paper commitments, regulations, and laws in China, whether it's really upheld remains to be seen,” Richardson told ABC News.
“There are considerable economic interests in the organ trade that are to a large extent unaddressed by this policy, and the government's willingness to discipline those in official positions -- be they prison guards or administrators or doctors -- who violate such policies is scant. And all of this takes place against a backdrop of extremely weak protections for prisoners,” she said.
ABC News’ Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross and producer Rhonda Schwartz first exposed the illegal black market sale of kidneys from executed Chinese prisoners in a hidden camera investigation broadcast on ABC's Prime Time Live in 1997. In that report, a Chinese doctor was caught on camera accepting a cash payment of $5,000 in exchange for helping to arrange a kidney transplant from a prisoner at a Chinese military hospital. The story also included rare, never-before-seen footage of Chinese prisoners executed by a firing squad.
Following the ABC News report, the U. S. government put black market kidney sales on their list of human rights issues cited in their annual report and raised in diplomatic discussions with the Chinese government.
But real progress in stopping both the summary public executions and the subsequent organ transplants has been slow in coming, Richardson said.
Customers for the black market in kidneys came as far as the United States, where the ABC News team found advertisements for kidneys in Chinese language newspapers. But the largest number of customers was believed to come from within China and neighboring Asian countries, according to recent news reports from the region.
In announcing the policy change in early December – to take effect the first day of the Western new year, though the Chinese New Year isn’t until February -- the Chinese government minister also acknowledged a dramatic shortage of donated kidneys available for transplant, according to China Global Times.
Demand for organs in China far exceeds the supply, with the ratio of public organ donations being 0.6 to 100,000 people, said Huang in the Dec. 3 meeting.
According to state media, since 2010 there have only been about 3,000 public organ donations, out of a total of about 8,000 organs. Additionally, there are 300,000 patients on the waiting list for a transplant, while only around 10,000 surgeries take place each year.
Part of the problem, according to experts, could be philosophical.
“Asian cultures, especially Confucian cultures, have a strong cultural bend against donating organs,” said John Kamm, the Executive Director of Dui Hua, a China-focused human rights group based in San Francisco.
Kamm and Paul Goldin, the University of Pennsylvania’s professor of Chinese Thought, said they think that the Chinese government has attempted to control these beliefs and that the younger generations are less traditional, but they could still have an impact.
“The issue with organ donorship [sic] is that it destroys the body and an intact body would be crucial for the afterlife… It could be a more eternal punishment,” Goldin said of the Confucian tradition.
Huang told state media that despite these cultural stigmas, he was optimistic that the increasing number of public organ donations would be enough to satisfy the demand.
Gordon Chang, author of “The Coming Collapse of China,” thinks that this change in policy maybe a result of a shift in the Chinese value system.
“It shows a bottom-up pressure from Chinese society, which has forced the government to take action,” Chang said.

"The highly-politicized climate change debate rages on as we approach the crucial 2016 U. S. presidential election, despite an ever-growing body of evidence revealing the fact that “catastrophic man-made global warming” is nothing more than an elaborate hoax.
And the November election may prove to be a victory for the hoaxers, according to experts who happen to be among those who dare to challenge the spurious climate change narrative.
One of these experts is Weather Channel founder John Coleman, who is now warning that the election could prove to be a “tipping point” in favor of people like Al Gore, who continue to amass vast fortunes based on the global warming scam.
In a recent interview with Climate Depot, Coleman said:
“Al Gore may emerge from the shadows to declare victory in the ‘global warming’ debate if Hillary Clinton moves into the White House. Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.”
Climate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.
Al Gore’s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 – a year that was touted as being “the hottest ever” in the Earth’s history – there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.
On top of those “inconvenient truths,” the White House’s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Severalindependently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the “97 percent” statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.
More objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.
“A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climatemodels to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.”
Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda – even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents.
And, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.
Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth – not human activity.
Al Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoax
But the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you’re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 – largely due to investments in fake “green tech” companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.

"The Trump administration’s single-page tax plan might be light on details, but tax experts say it’s likely that upper-middle-class families, especially those living in blue states, could take a hit, even as the wealthiest Americans get a windfall.
“Nineteen bullet points don’t make a tax plan,” said Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Tax experts echoed the futility of trying to make projections — or, for average Americans, trying to plan their financial futures — without any detailed insight into what parts of the tax code might change.
For instance, Trump’s economic team said it wants to replace the current tax brackets with just three, at 10, 25 and 35 percent, but didn’t provide income parameters.
“Some people will potentially come out ahead, particularly if they didn’t have a lot of deductions,” said Steve Ellis, vice president at Taxpayers for Common Sense. But for families with six-figure incomes who itemize and take a lot of deductions, Trump’s plan might not be the tax cut they were expecting.
Related: Here's What We Know So Far About Trump's Tax Plan
“You’re making lots of guesses,” said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.
Tax experts say even a household with $100,000 in annual income might not wind up in a better position.
“Somebody in that general economic stratum is somebody who almost certainly works for a living,” said Marshall Steinbaum, senior economist and fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. “Their income is going to be drawn from labor,” rather than from investments.
This is significant because Trump’s tax ideas are tilted heavily towards easing the tax burden on business and investment income.
“There’s no doubt that the majority of the benefits will be received by people like Donald Trump himself.”
“Relative to what very high-income people will get from it, a family of four at $100,000 frankly isn’t going to benefit from much of it,” said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “There’s no doubt that the majority of the benefits will be received by people like Donald Trump himself.”
The administration touted its increase of the standard deduction, up to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly, which would likely prompt fewer taxpayers to itemize.
Across all income groups, about 30 percent of taxpayers currently itemize their returns, but that number climbs sharply along with income. Nearly 60 percent of taxpayers with incomes between $75,000 and $100,000 itemize, according to the Tax Foundation, and that figure climbs to nearly 80 percent for those who earn between $100,000 and $200,000.
“Certainly, in many cases, doubling the standard deduction would take people out of being an itemizer,” Ellis said.
This might not help taxpayers who live in states with high state and local taxes. Currently, taxpayers in the bottom half of the top income quintile — that is, those with an average income of $129,000 — pay nearly 11 percent in state and local taxes as a percentage of income, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Under today’s tax code, they can write off state and local taxes on their federal returns; Trump’s plan would eliminate nearly all deductions, save for mortgage interest and charitable donations.
“It’s well known that most states with high state taxes are Democratic ones, so there’s a clear political implication of that,” Kirkegaard said.
Scrapping deductions en masse would affect all sorts of taxpayers. College students and their families would lose the benefit of being able to deduct student loan interest, and there is no word on how or even if higher-education credits that are part of the tax code today would be preserved.
Although the administration specified that retirement savings would be protected, nothing was said about healthcare — either the tax-preferred status of employer-provided plans, or pretax dollars used by the increasing number of high-deductible policyholders for their health savings accounts.
During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump called for eliminating personal exemptions. “That’s an important thing,” Marr said, because this could hurt large families who right now can claim an exemption for each child.
Eliminating head-of-household filing status, another idea Trump embraced during his campaign, also would hurt large families, and single parents, as well.
“The whole plan is aimed at an across-the-board tax break for corporations.”
“Every single mother — and father — in the broad middle would see a tax increase because you have this less favorable filing status, and they’d lose the personal exemptions for themselves and their kids,” Williams said.
Although the proposal was touted as a middle-class tax cut, “if they don’t do it the right way, it won’t be,” Williams said.
Some tax experts were blunter in their assessments. Steinbaum said middle class families would derive little benefit from a tax plan that caters to billionaires and corporations. “The whole plan is aimed at an across-the-board tax break for corporations,” he said.
“It’s not really a proposal. It’s a set of ideas… it’s an ideological direction,” Kirkegaard said. “It goes in a regressive direction and it leaves the future generations to pay most of the bill.”",0
"Rent-to-own retailer BrightHouse has been told to pay 14.8m to 249,000 customers by the financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
BrightHouse will compensate customers who had cancelled agreements after one downpayment but had not been refunded.
It will also make payments to those who signed up to lending agreements that ""may not have been affordable"".
The FCA said BrightHouse had not acted as a ""responsible lender"".
The firm, which lets customers pay for household items such as washing machines and televisions on a weekly basis, has been criticised for its business model.
In 2016 a BBC investigation conducted by Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, highlighted the example of a 358 washing machine that ended up costing more than 1,000.
BrightHouse has apologised to customers about failing to refund them.
There is no need for customers affected to contact BrightHouse. It will write to 213,000 current and former customers by the end of the year, explaining what they are due.
Sasha Rhodes of Sheffield bought a king-size bed from BrightHouse on a two-year contract.
""I don't think they ran enough checks to ensure I was able to make the payments - all they were interested in was my money,"" she says.
""I did not realise how high interest payments were. I stopped payments after 16 months. I think I paid them around 800 in total for what must have been a 400 bed.""
Customers whose deposits BrightHouse failed to refund signed up between April 2010 and April 2017. These customers will receive an average payment of 27.
The second group includes those who took out an agreement between April 2014 and September 2016. They will get an average of 147.
In the case of customers who were not assessed properly at the start of the loan who may have had difficulty making payments, BrightHouse will pay back interest and fees along with compensatory interest of 8% - if they return the goods.
Those who kept the goods will have their balances written off.
FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey told Radio 5 Live the move set a ""very important precedent... BrightHouse did not behave as responsible lenders and they failed to meet our expectations"".
Lois Grant, from York, worked for BrightHouse from 2012 to 2016 as a branch manager in Yorkshire and London but left because of ""unacceptable"" high-pressure sales techniques.
""In the early days, we did not ask people about their expenditure at all. We just checked what their income was. They changed that policy because the FCA came to investigate, asking for more stringent checks.
""I can't remember ever giving any money back to any customer. This is despite one of their policies that said if you cancel within 14 days you would get a refund. I know from several experiences that rarely happened, if ever.""
Citizens Advice said it had helped more than 13,000 people with rent-to-own issues over the past 12 months, many of whom were struggling to make payments on essential goods such as fridges and washing machines.
""We're pleased to see that the FCA are taking action against BrightHouse whose loose lending practices have pushed the very people who can least afford it further into financial difficulty,"" said its chief executive, Gillian Guy.
The charity said it had found one in five rent-to-own customers spent 20% or more of their income on payments, and more than half had to take on other debts to cover the costs.
It is asking that the same conditions apply to all forms of high-cost credit as the payday loans cap - meaning that no one would pay more than what they borrowed in interest and charges.
Separate criticism came from the Financial Inclusion Centre, a think tank that compiled a report into the company last year.
Gareth Evans, a co-director of the think tank, said BrightHouse had made profits at a personal cost for some customers, with some having to prioritise repayments over food or heating.
BrightHouse chief executive Hamish Paton sincerely apologised to those affected: ""We're absolutely determined that this doesn't happen again and have made significant improvements over the last 18 months.""
The firm said it had overhauled its application process to ensure future loans were affordable and that customers were treated fairly during the collections process.
BrightHouse was founded in 1994 as Crazy George and rebranded as BrightHouse in 2002. It is owned by private equity firm Vision Capital and has about 280 stores.

"Irma is moving into the Southeast U. S., bringing torrential rain with it.
The storm made its first Florida landfall in the Keys on Sunday morning. On Sunday afternoon, the eye of the storm came ashore in Marco Island, Fla., around 3:35 p.m.
Irma’s storm surge will be catastrophic in some places.
“Storm surge flooding of 10-15 ft is now expected along the SW Florida coast,” the National Hurricane Center tweeted on Saturday. “This is a dire and life-threatening situation.”
More than half of all hurricane deaths are caused by storm surge.
 Card Sound Bridge through Cape Sable, including the Florida Keys— 5 to 10 feet
Destructive, sustained winds of 60+ mph are expected to begin on the Florida Peninsula on Sunday morning and will spread northward through Monday. Power outages are likely, even away from the coast.
Sustained winds of 100+ mph are likely near the coast. The Naples area may well be hit the by the strongest winds — 115 to 135 mph with higher gusts — which would arrive Sunday morning.
It cannot be understated how dangerous these winds will be.
Rainfall will be torrential in some locations, though it’s impossible to know exactly where the heaviest rain will occur. All inland locations that receive rain from Hurricane Irma or its remnants should be prepared for flash flooding.
As the storm moves north, it will take the flood threat with it. Georgia, South Carolina and western North Carolina should all be prepared for torrential rain and dangerous flash flooding, especially in mountainous areas, early next week.
 The Florida peninsula and southeast Georgia— 8 to 15 inches, isolated 20 inches
 The eastern Florida Panhandle and southern South Carolina— 4 to 8 inches, isolated 10 inches
 Rest of eastern Georgia, western South Carolina, and western North Carolina— 4 to 8 inches
 Western Georgia, eastern and northern Alabama, and southern Tennessee— 2 to 5 inches
Tornadoes are possible in South Florida on Saturday night. The risk spreads north on Sunday. A tornado watch was in effect for South Florida until 12 a.m. Sunday.
The last “major” hurricane — registering as a Category 3 storm or stronger — to make landfall in Florida was Hurricane Wilma in October 2005. Wilma was also the last major hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the United States until Harvey struck Texas late last month.
The Tampa Bay area hasn’t had a direct hit from a hurricane since 1921, but this part of the state is extremely vulnerable to flooding.
Hurricane Irma made landfall at Cudjoe Key, Fla., just east of Key West, at 9:10 a.m. At the time, the storm was crawling to the north-northwest at just 8 mph. It was lashing the Florida Keys with sustained winds over 100 mph and a dangerous storm surge.
Irma has a nearly week-long history in the Caribbean. The storm ravaged the islands of Barbuda and Antigua as well as St. Martin on Tuesday.
Apocalyptic scenes of flattened buildings and ruined airports emerged from the once-lush islands — even as another potent storm, Hurricane Jose, followed fast in Irma’s wake.
About 95 percent of the tiny islands of Barbuda and St. Martin sustained some damage or were outright destroyed, officials and local residents said. Ghastly photos and videos from St. Martin and St. Barthelemy, also known as St. Barts, showed buildings in ruin and cars and trucks almost submerged in the storm surge.
“Everything is a disaster, total devastation,” Dieter Schaede said by telephone from St. Martin, where he lives. “Roofs down, houses totally flown away, wiped out.”
On Wednesday, the storm battered Puerto Rico as the eye tracked to the north of San Juan. Intense wind gusts were reported, including 111 mph on Culebra Island and 131 mph on Buck Island in the U. S. Virgin Islands. More than a million people were left without power in Puerto Rico, and communication channels were sparse.
On Thursday, Irma moved on to the island of Hispaniola, which includes the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Gen. Rafael A. Carrasco, said that at least 2,721 homes have been damaged in the Dominican Republic. The government said nearly 7,000 people had been evacuated from their homes, and 7,400 tourists had been moved from beachside hotels.
The Haiti Civil Protection Agency reported “moderate flooding” in four northern provinces and said a bridge linking Haiti to the Dominican Republic had collapsed in the border city of Ouanaminthe.
Less than a week after Hurricane Harvey dissipated over Texas, another major hurricane threatens the U. S. coast. It is very rare to have back-to-back major hurricanes make landfall on the U.S. mainland.
According to the National Hurricane Center, it’s only happened twice before that we know of:
2004: Hurricane Ivan made landfall on the Gulf Coast as a Category 3, then Hurricane Jeanne made landfall as a Category 3 on Hutchinson Island, Fla., north of Miami.
After a long, restless night, residents of Nuevitas, Cuba, ventured out of their homes Saturday morning to inspect damage. “It’s a total disaster,” said Dianelys Alvarez, who told The Post there was not a single tree still standing. “The streets are full of rubble. There are houses with their roofs ripped off. Even the oldest trees in town have been knocked down,” she said. (The Post’s Nick Miroff)
The Washington Post’s Marc Fisher and Perry Steinoffer a thought-provoking story on the paralyzing fear and anxiety in the world right now — from a nuclear North Korea to a deadly earthquake in Mexico and a catastrophic hurricane season. “Fear is in the water these days, spread with a new and viral efficiency on social media, into everyone’s homes and everyone’s pockets at all hours, every day.”
Hurricane Irma is changing the shape of the ocean. As winds blow into the storm, it’s pushing ocean water along with it. It’s drawing water away from the shorelines in the Bahamas. This video is pretty incredible. (The Post’s Angela Fritz)
Technology is making it easier to stay in touch with loved ones during natural disasters. Zello, a walkie-talkie app, climbed to No. 1 in app stores after Harvey. Now, a communication device that is used by military operators is also gaining traction: goTenna Mesh. (The Post’s Peter Holley)
Sir Richard Branson literally owns an island that just got crushed by Hurricane Irma. The billionaire founder of the Virgin Group rode out the storm in a fortified wine cellar. (The Post’s Amy B. Wang and Alex Horton)
Hurricane Irma had max wind speeds of at least 180 mph for 37 hours, which is a new record for anywhere on Earth.Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) — which devastated the Philippines and killed more than 6,000 people in 2013 — was the previous record-holder at 24 hours. (Capital Weather Gang)
Amid fears of price gouging, JetBlue offered $99 seats on flightsfrom South Florida. One woman’s search for a flight out of Florida yielded a $3,200-dollar one-way fare on Expedia. Delta helped her find a cheaper flight, but Expedia can’t explain why it was selling such expensive tickets. (The Post’s Luz Lazoand Lori Aratani)
On top of all the destruction in the Atlantic, the west coast of Mexico experienced an 8.1-magnitude earthquake on Friday morning. President Enrique Pea Nieto called it the biggest quake in 100 years. Dozens of people are dead and more are injured. Reports continue to flow in. (The Post’s Joshua Partlow)

"For decades now, pickups have been the best-selling vehicles in America, and two of the most popular are the Ford F-150 and the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 . These trucks are modern, comfortable and capable, especially when it comes to towing and hauling. So what sets them apart from the other trucks in their class? And what sets them apart from each other? Let's find out.
On the road, both the Silverado 1500 and the F-150 are comfortable and easy to drive. The Silverado 1500 is a great road-trip vehicle thanks to its quiet cabin, smooth ride and plush seats, while the F-150 feels more nimble in tight spaces and around corners. Maneuverability may not be one of your primary concerns, but it's worth considering if you're going to be using your truck as a daily driver.
Depending on their configurations, both trucks are capable of towing well over 10,000 pounds. The F-150 maxes out at 13,200 pounds, and the Silverado 1500 has a maximum tow rating of 12,800 pounds. That's enough capability to tow all but the heaviest trailers. Take into account that those numbers are for the most powerful engines and highest axle ratios, both of which will put a dent in your mileage numbers.
The maximum payload capacity for the F-150 is 3,270 pounds; for the Silverado 1500, it is 2,250 pounds. There's a big difference there, so if you plan on carrying heavy items in the bed, the Ford offers a significant advantage. Again, like the towing numbers, these payload capacities are heavily influenced by other factors such as the engine, transmission and axle ratio, so keep that in mind when comparing trucks side by side.
The F-150 has an edge in this category since two of its available V6 engines offer up to 22 mpg in combined driving, according to the EPA. The most fuel-efficient Silverado 1500 is the base V6 that delivers 20 mpg combined. But when it comes to the midrange V8s, it's an even match: Both the F-150 and Silverado are rated at 19 mpg in combined driving. The numbers again tip in the Ford's favor when you consider the higher-horsepower engines. Chevrolet's 6.2-liter V8 is rated at 17 mpg combined in most configurations, while the optional twin-turbocharged V6 in the F-150 delivers up to 21 mpg combined.
Both trucks can be equipped with active safety features such as forward collision mitigation and lane departure warning to help avoid accidents. The F-150 also offers an optional trailer-backup assistance system to guide you down a boat ramp as well as adaptive cruise control for reduced fatigue on long highway drives. When it comes to high-tech features, both trucks are available with onboard Wi-Fi as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for easy cellphone integration. We like Ford's Sync 3 user interface for its lightning-fast responses and crisp graphics. Chevrolet's MyLink system isn't far behind, but certain elements of its design look a bit dated in comparison.
Pricing is one area in which the Ford and Chevy are closely matched, at least on the bottom end. Both start out at around $27,000 in basic work-truck form, which means a regular cab with minimal amenities. As you step up to more popular trim levels, prices work their way past $40,000 up to the high $50,000s. The F-150's top Limited trim level has an eye-watering MSRP of $63,845, which is significantly more expensive than the priciest Silverado 1500, the High Country ($55,075 MSRP). Keep in mind that the 2018 Ford F-150 received several upgrades this year, so there might be fewer on dealer lots and they'll command higher prices. The Silverado is due for a redesign for the 2019 model year, so the current model will be readily available and may have incentives on the hood as well.
The refreshed F-150 offers more ultimate capability and higher fuel economy numbers and is more rewarding to drive in a spirited fashion. The Silverado 1500 isn't far behind in any of those categories, plus it has a forgiving highway ride, a quiet cabin, and plush seats that make it comfortable for the long haul. Deciding which truck is right for you depends on what features and capabilities you use most often. For now, we prefer the Ford's blend of efficiency, power and technology, but expect to see a much-improved Silverado come next year.

"Every beneficiary of a botched energy scheme that could cost taxpayers 400m will be inspected to check for abuse of public money, Arlene Foster has said.
The first minister was in charge of a Stormont department that set up the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) in 2012.
But serious flaws, including an overgenerous subsidy offer, meant the scheme went far beyond its budget.
Mrs Foster told the BBC she wants to see the publication of a full list of names of those availing of the scheme.
* 1,946 applications were approved under the non-domestic RHI scheme - a 98% approval rate
* 984 were received in just three months - September to November 2015 - after officials announced plans to cut the subsidy but before the change took effect
* The assembly's Public Accounts Committee was told that a subsequent independent audit had found issues at half of the 300 installations inspected
* 14 of those fell into the most serious category where fraud was suspected
* Payments to five of these 14 sites have been suspended
Officials from the Northern Ireland Executive will inspect all non-domestic claimants of the scheme and will write to them to seek permission for their names to be made public in a bid to restore public confidence.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader also said she has ""nothing to hide"" over her role in the scheme, and her party added that neither she ""or members of her immediate family have benefitted"" from it.
The RHI scheme was set up by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Deti) to encourage businesses and other non-domestic users to switch to biomass heating systems, mostly burning wood pellets.
But it paid out subsidies that were greater than the cost of the pellets, leaving the scheme open to abuse as users could earn more cash the more fuel they burned.
During her time as enterprise minister, Mrs Foster was told about the flaw by a whistleblower, although the concerns were ignored by Deti officials.
Mrs Foster said civil servants did not inform her of any issues arising from the whistleblower's alert.
She said she regretted that the set-up of the scheme was flawed, and she did not rule out appearing before Stormont's Public Accounts Committee, which is investigating it.
""I want to help in any legitimate way and I will look at all of the requests that come in to me,"" she said.
""I have nothing to fear from any of this because there's nothing there - I have no difficulty in answering questions.
""I brought forward the policy but unfortunately the implementation of it has gone askew.""
Mrs Foster said action had to be taken ""to make sure that we right that wrong"", and that would involve inspections of all RHI installations ""to make sure they are doing what they are supposed to be doing"".
""There's a very small minority of people abusing the scheme - already abuses have been identified from the initial inspections,"" she added.
""It's important that we know what is the uptake of the scheme [and] how is it working, to get back public confidence.
""And we'll be writing to all of those in receipt of RHI money and asking them for their consent to put their name forward.""
Political opponents accused Mrs Foster of shirking responsibility on the issue.
Ulster Unionist Party leader Mr Nesbitt said she was ""in denial"" and her interview with the BBC was ""all about blaming everyone but herself"".
And Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood said her ""credibility is draining away by the hour"", adding that the public would not be ""satisfied with her answers or her attitude"".
""Her interview was seeped with the arrogant belief that she has nothing to answer for,"" he added.
""That attitude was vividly revealed when she didn't even show the decency of offering the whistleblower a proper apology.""
Mrs Foster said Stephen Brimstone, a former special advisor to her Executive Office department, is a claimant of the RHI scheme.
But his departure from the role last month was not connected to the emergence of the energy scandal, she added.
Other participants in the scheme have said they entered it fairly and are in legitimate receipt of subsidy payments.
The News Letter reported that DUP MLA Mervyn Storey is an elder at a County Antrim church that is benefitting from the scheme.
Mr Storey said he had no role in drawing up Hebron Free Presbyterian Church's application to the scheme.
Rev David Park, the minister at the Ballymoney-based church, said it is giving ""surplus money"" it makes from the scheme to charity.
He added that ""at least 5,000"" each year for the next 20 years would be donated, amounting to a total of 100,000.
Car dealership Charles Hurst said it would be ""undertaking a review of how [the scheme] applies to our business"" due to the controversy surrounding it.
The firm said it applied ""entirely in good faith"", and at no stage did it ""seek to disadvantage taxpayers"".
Mrs Foster said names of claimants were ""being plucked out... and being publicly exposed"".
""A lot of these people actually applied to the scheme in a very legitimate way,"" she added.
The first minister also said the cost to the public purse would ultimately be ""significantly less"" than the projected 400m over 20 years.

"Jim Marrs, the author who wrote the bookCrossfire: The Plot to Kill Kennedy, died of a heart attack Wednesday at his Wise County home. His death comes just months before the CIA is set to declassify documents about the death of President John F. Kennedy.
Marrs’ book helped inspire the Oliver Stone movieJFK, and he is well known as a “conspiracy theorist,” the title given to anyone who questions the government’s official story on any topic. In fact, Marrs was considered the leading expert on JFK conspiracy theories. Given the timing of Marrs’ death, and the government’s (specifically the CIA) ability to make an assassination look like a heart attack, many are adjusting their tin foil hats accordingly.
The CIA does, indeed, have an assassination weapon that makes a murder look like a heart attack, allowing them to avoid blame.Whistleblower Mary Embree said of the “heart attack gun”: “The poison was frozen into some sort of dart and then it was shot at very high speed into the person. When it reached the person it would melt inside them, and there would be a tiny red dot on their body, which was hard to detect. There wouldn’t be a needle or anything like that left in the person.”
The last of the JFK files that are still classifiedarescheduled for declassification in October of this year. Their contents are unknown and could range from mundane to shocking in nature. But with Marrs’ untimely death, many believe they are about to be a little more revealing than the government desires. If nothing else, the fact that the government possesses this “assassination weapon” should raise so many red flags one would think they were drowning in a Bloody Mary cocktail.
The remaining classified records consist of 3,000 sealed documents and 34,000 previously redacted files. After Congress passed the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act in 1992, federal agencies transferred all custody of relevant files to the National Archives – roughly 5 million pages. The only thing that can now stop the declassification of these documents, is president Donald Trump.
Which brings us back to Marrs’ death, the timing of which is highly suspicious. Especially considering Marrs didn’t just write books, and remember, he died of a heart attack. He taught courses on the JFK assassination and UFOs at the University of Texas at Arlington before retiring in 2007. In a 2003 Star-Telegram article, Marrs said lawyers, teachers, even an official with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had taken his classes.
Marrs’ also wrote other books that probably have put him firmly in the “conspiracy” category by those who seek censorship to protect the government. In addition to“Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy,” which reached The New York Times paperback nonfiction bestseller list, other titles include: “Alien Agenda” (1997); “Rule by Secrecy” (2000); “The Terror Conspiracy Revisited” (2007); “The Rise of the Fourth Reich” (2008); “The Trillion-Dollar Conspiracy” (2010); “Our Occulted History” (2013); “Population Control” (2015); and his last book, “The Illuminati” (2017). The titles of the books alone aren’t comforting to anyone with any faith at all left in the government, and the descriptions are even less settling.
Historians and government officials continue to balk at the thought of people questioning their official story of the JFK assassination. Perhaps if the government would stop telling obvious lies in order to control the dialogue around issues in the name of “controlling the herd” via propaganda, we could stop looking for the truth. The fact is, the government has lied and covered up enough that questioning their actions and motives has become second nature for most. The only question that comes to mind now is:

"LOS ANGELES — Here's a great way to make a quick buck: stand on line for hours at an Apple Store, pick up two new iPhones X's, then jump onto eBay or Craigslist, mark them up and wait for the profits to pour in.
The idea is that a busy person who doesn't want to wait on line will spend the extra money, just to get ahold ofthe new iPhone now.
The new iPhone X starts at $999, but ""I've seen prices like $2,000,"" on sites like eBay, Jeoung An told us Friday, after putting in several hours on the Apple Store line at a local shopping mall. He planned to buy two unitsand raise enough money to buy a 15-inch MacBook Pro, which starts at $2,400.
In fact, prices on re-sale sites are all over the map, as low as $1,450 for opening bid prices on eBay, to as high as $6, 710, for both the entry level model with 64 GB of storage, and the 256 GB editions.
That doesn't mean the re-sellers will get those prices, but on eBay at least, there are no models listed at regular prices.
Sellers are hoping to attract customers who couldn't spend the time to wait in lineand didn't want to wait for an online order to deliver the phone to their doorstep. OnFriday, expected wait times for iPhone Xwas three to four weeks.
On the Letgo app, which looks to take on Craigslist with a more mobile friendly interface, prices for the iPhone X are just as steep, with several models for $1,200, $1450 and even $5,000.
David Azed was at the Westfield Century City mall Friday hoping to buy two iPhone X models for re-sale, which would join the other model he purchasedin the initial pre-order last week.
He owns an iPhone 6S from 2015 and sees no reason to upgrade. ""I'll buy a new phone next year."" For now, it's about raising quick money.
""I think Apple intentionally made demand scarce,"" he says. ""To build hype. It’s probably a smart thing to do.""
With 400 people joining him on the line Friday, he may be onto something.",0

"GLEN ELLEN, Calif. -- The cost of the deadliest wildfires in California history is rising. Forty-two people were killed, and on Monday, authorities said flames destroyed at least 8,400 homes and buildings -- a significant jump.
That's not all that went up in smoke.
The fires that burned through California's wine country destroyed most of the crop Erich Pearson had just harvested -- no, not grapes, but marijuana.
""This was a 40,000 square foot barn, which is about an acre in size,"" Pearson said. ""There's processing and packaging for cannabis in here.""
In September, Pearson began picking a bumper crop, the first harvest since marijuana for recreational use became legal in California.
""Long days of hard work but it's very exciting,"" said Pearson, who is CEO of Sparc, a company that has been running medical marijuana dispensaries since 2009.
He had hoped to capture some of the $5 billion dollars expected to be spent annually on legal marijuana in California. Last month, CBS News toured Sparc's new Sonoma facility where marijuana was being processed and prepared for retail sale. Cases of marijuana were stacked along the wall.
But then, wine countrywent up in flames.
""If it wasn't metal, it's not here anymore. I mean, there were plastic trays, containers and things. The fire was so hot you can't even see that stuff anymore.""
Many of the marijuana plants survived. But damaged by smoke and ash, they will lose much of their value in the retail market.
Pearson said he couldn't say how much he lost at this point.
And he's not alone. There are at least 3,000 marijuana farming operations nearby. The Growers Association estimates tens of millions have been lost.
""It's a setback, but on the other hand we are trying to make lemonade out of lemons,"" he said, admitting that they'll find a way to survive.
Growing marijuana already faced a troubling reality: the federal government still considers the harvest a crime, so there is no insurance coverage for marijuana.",0

President Trump on Oct. 31 held a meeting on tax reform at the White House. (The Washington Post)   House Republican leaders on Thursday proposed an overhaul of the U. S. tax code, introducing legislation that would sharply cut tax rates for corporations and individuals while scrapping or scaling back numerous tax breaks Americans and businesses have used for decades. The bill, unveiled by GOP leaders at an elaborate rollout news conference Thursday morning at the Capitol, would slash the corporate tax rate from 35percent to 20percent and reduce income-tax rates for families and individuals. As a counterbalance, it would eliminate tax deductions businesses and households have relied on. In a number of cases, the plan cuts back on tax benefits for families and individuals while expanding benefits for companies. In total, the plan contains $1trillion in total tax cuts over 10 years for businesses and $300billion for individuals and families, as well as $200billion in tax cuts — almost all of which will accrue among the wealthiest families — by repealing the estate tax, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The bill’s net effect on middle- and working-class households, however, remains difficult to discern — the trade-off between reduced rates and eliminated deductions means its impact will vary widely from one family to another depending on circumstances and geography. For Republicans, the tax push represents another opportunity, possibly their last, to pass a major piece of legislation before next November’s elections, when their majorities in the House and Senate will be challenged. President Trump has put changing the tax code at the center of his domestic agenda, and the party holds enough seats in the House and Senate to pass the bill into law without support from a single Democratic lawmaker. But to succeed, GOP lawmakers will have to avoid the internal divisions that have undermined other major legislative efforts, including multiple failed attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Trump praised House lawmakers for introducing the bill and predicted some iteration of the tax cut plan will be signed into law by year’s end. “We are giving them a big, beautiful Christmas present in the form of a tremendous tax cut,” he said in brief remarks from the White House. The bill introduced Thursday is the result of months of negotiation among Trump administration officials and many Republican lawmakers. And while it contains long-held conservative goals, including cutting rates and simplifying the tax code, it also includes provisions that are the result of compromises with some of the party’s less conservative members.      All your major questions about the GOP tax plan, answered     All your major questions about the GOP tax plan, answered  For individuals and families, income-tax rates would go down. Presently, families have to pay a tax rate of 39.6percent on income above $470,700. The House Republican bill would apply that tax rate only to income above $1 million for families. Rates further down the income spectrum would be cut as well. “It’s an awesome tax cut,” said Rep. Bill Flores (R-Tex.). “I mean, it rebuilds working-class America — great for jobs, great for the economy. It’s going to be huge.” The bill would seek to balance revenue lost to the rate cuts, however, by scrapping numerous tax breaks, some of which are used by tens of millions of Americans and have large-scale support. The legislation would slash the popular mortgage interest deduction. Under current tax law, Americans can deduct interest payments made on their first $1million worth of home loans. The bill would allow existing mortgages to keep the current rules, but for new mortgages, home buyers would be able to deduct interest payments made only on their first $500,000 worth of loans. The bill would also scale back a deduction that, under current law, allows Americans to deduct taxes they pay to state and local governments from their federal tax bill. Republicans initially proposed eliminating that deduction entirely, but after a revolt from GOP lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and other high-tax states, the bill introduced Thursday contained a compromise. The bill would allow people to deduct their local property taxes from their taxable income, but only up to the first $10,000. And Americans would no longer be able to deduct their medical expenses or property and casualty losses, according to a document outlining the plan. Tax credits for electric cars would be eliminated. Americans would no longer be able to deduct moving expenses or alimony payments. Large college endowments would pay taxes on their income in a way that treats them more like private foundations. Some deductions would be expanded. The bill would nearly double the standard deduction that many Americans claim on their taxes, raising it from $12,700 to $24,000 per family. But this benefit would be partially offset by the elimination of the personal exemption many Americans can claim, which can be large for families with multiple children. The legislation would create a new “Family Flexibility Credit” of $300 for parents and non-child dependents, but this credit would be eliminated in five years, and it would increase the child tax credit from $1,000 per child to $1,600. That credit would phase out once a family earns more than $230,000 a year, more than double the current $110,000 threshold.    A look at what President Trump has promised Americans as it relates to his tax reform plan. (Joyce Koh/The Washington Post)   The bill would add up to $1.5trillion over 10 years to the national deficit, a move that contrasts with Republicans’ efforts under President Barack Obama to block legislation that could have expanded the deficit.  With legislation introduced, the GOP tax effort moves into a new and perilous phase, with party leaders working to unify their caucus behind the measure while individual lawmakers seek changes that match their ideologies or the preferences of their constituents and donors — all while Democrats pound the measure and attempt to rally the public against it. Party leaders are setting an ambitious timeline, with the House and Senate hoping to pass legislation before Thanksgiving. A Senate bill has not yet been introduced. The GOP effort will also be tested by what House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) warned would be an “army of lobbyists” that would push Congress to make changes on behalf of their client industries and interest groups. At least one major industry group, the National Association of Home Builders, announced days before the bill was released that the group would not support it, and others joined the attack within minutes of the measure’s unveiling. The powerful National Federation of Independent Businesses said it was also not backing the effort, saying the legislation “leaves too many small businesses behind.” Other business groups lauded the bill and are expected to try to help it win passage. “In terms of a legislative text that addresses the core issues that must be addressed if we are going to grow our economy faster and raise wages for families, this is a home run,” said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   Which tax breaks are for you?  Among lobbying groups, the change to the mortgage interest deduction has proved particularly contentious. Some budget experts have said this change is necessary because otherwise the tax code essentially subsidizes the purchase of large homes in the wealthiest parts of the country. But housing groups have long fought off such a change, as the median home price in numerous parts of the country can be very high. Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders, said his group would fight the bill “tooth and nail,” claiming that it could lead to a decline in home prices and a housing recession. “This now is a direct assault on the American dream of homeownership,” he said in an interview. Republicans said these changes are necessary to allow them to lower tax rates for all taxpayers. But many Democrats signaled opposition, vowing to fight its passage even while in the political minority. “It raises taxes on the middle class — millions of middle-class families across the country — borrows trillions from the future, from our children’s future, to give tax cuts to the wealthiest,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The bill would not make changes to popular retirement plans such as 401(k)s, though. It also would not attempt to repeal provisions of the Affordable Care Act, though Republicans have said they might try to change the bill later for these purposes. The legislative fight over the tax bill has become the Trump administration’s biggest political goal after failed attempts to repeal the ACA. Trump wants the legislation to pass the House and the Senate by the end of the year, though they must resolve numerous differences. Other changes in the bill would be far reaching. It would, for example, make changes to college savings programs and have new requirements for tax-exempt organizations such as churches and charities. Republican supporters of the measure said Americans will see a number of changes if the tax plan is signed into law, but they argued that the final result would be a major tax cut. “They’re interested in tax relief,” said Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.). “They’re not particularly interested in the formula by which that relief gets to them.”

"Eight Things Maserati Has to Do to Make the Quattroporte Better
People love Maserati for its looks and its history. But at $110,600, the brand’s mega-sedan has some flaws.
Brits love Maserati. At least, the two Brits I had dinner with Wednesday night in L. A. do. They were so excited to see the latest car I was testing that they waited outside on the sidewalk after the meal while I pulled it out of parking, then climbed all over the front and back excited to be even just sitting in the “MAZZ-uh,” as they called it. The enthusiasm speaks to the legend and heritage of the brand that has borne the trident logo since 1914. It has created lifelong devotees with such hits as the 1960s-era Ghibli coupe and 3500 GT. I wish its current big sedan, the Quattroporte, were on apar with those icons. The top-line Maserati Quattroporte GTS has a twin-turbo V8 530-hp Ferrari-made engine. The S Q4 version has a V6, 404-hp engine.
Unfortunately, there are a few other contenders (BMW 7-Series; Porsche Panamera) more deserving of your hard-earned money than this one, at least for now. While the latest Quattroporte sports some significant improvements over last year, such asnoticeable exterior restyling,a redesigned infotainment system and center console,and bolstered engine specs, it remains far from perfect. Here are eight things Maserati has to change to make its Quattroporte better. The car starts at $147,000 for the high-end GTS version. The base version costs $104,400.The $110,600 Quattroporte S Q4 I drove all over Los Angeles, Joshua Tree, and Yucca Valley in central California featured a twin-turbo V6404-hp Ferrari-made engine. It also has an all-wheel drive capable of peak torque at 406 pound-feet and a top speed of 176mph. (This top speed is an improvement over the previous generation.) Zero to 60 mph is 4.8seconds. These specifications roughly match other entries in this category, but the ZF eight-speed automatic transmission and electronically controlled shock absorbers were so delayed in their response to any press of the gas pedal that the numbers might as well have been slower. Driving down Highway 10 past Palm Springs felt like heavy lifting—there was noticeable time lapse between pushing the accelerator and gathering speed to blitz past slower traffic, and the transition between gears—especially the lower ones--should have been much smoother than it was. Maserati says the Quattroporte has an “ideal 50:50 weight distribution” in its body and features much aluminum in the chassis, body, and suspension so that “performance and comfort are again unparalleled.” But this is not the case. The curved mountain road to Idyllwild from L.A. is fraught with tight, steep turns and abrupt corners. This isn’t a sport coupe—I don’t expect it to be. But the way the hips lagged behind the car, then lumbered and fell forward when they finally caught up to the rest of the car as it gained momentum around turns quickly became taxing. Stepping out after an hour of quick driving on a technical, hairpin-turn road felt like stepping outside the ring after a heavy sparring session. The stick to shift in the Quattroporte requires the driver to push a button along the front of it to move from park, reverse, neutral and drive. It’s hard to tell what you’re doing, though; often I found myself accidentally shifting into reverse when I wanted neutral, or park when I wanted reverse. It was a constant battle to make sure I was in the correct gear before getting out or, even worse, reversing. It shouldn’t take careful consideration of the shifter knob and indicators to move a luxury car into neutral or drive, but that was the case here on a repeated basis. That has to change. The interior is covered in carbon fiber and high-quality leather.The new central console has a MTC 8.4-inch touchscreen with central control knob, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and available, excellent Bowers & Wilkins Premium Sound.
Another design quibble that, like the shifter, sounds like a small thing on paper but actually dominated much of the driving experience on a sizable daytrip like the one I did: The paddle shifters here are much longer than they are in, say, a BMW 7-Series or Porsche Panamera, and they are situated close to the steering wheel. That means my fingers got tangled sometimes between the shifter paddles, the turning indicators, and the windshield wipers (yes, I drove through fog and rain up in the hills outside Idyllwild). Still, I give Maserati high marks for making said shifters pure carbon fiber. That touch is par for the course these days in this segment, and I’m happy Maserati recognized it as such.The Quattroporte has AWD available in some models and RWD in the QuattroporteGTS version.The sound of an engine should not play a role in ultimate judgment of how that engine performs. I’ve said before that complaints about an engine’s particular tone will likely continue to fade as new generations adopt electric and autonomous technology in totality. And I’m a big fan of Formula E—the argument that it doesn’t “sound” like “real” Formula racing misses the whole point of the series. Still, we live in 2017, when combustion engines are still much the kings of the road. And this one sounded far from regal. When I did notice the muffled pop of the engine, it often seemed unrelated to anything actually happening under the hood, like a random sound unrelated to what I was doing behind the wheel. Most of the time it sounded phlegmy, like someone with egg caught in the back of his throat. Where Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz stand out as excellent in the engine note category (manufactured as those notes may be), this sits on the other end of the sound spectrum. Maserati started making luxury sedans in 1963 by putting a racing engine into an executive luxury car.Call me crazy, but I believe that if you pay upwards of $120,000 after options for a big black sedan, it should include such niceties as aheads-up display and a big, if not panoramic, sunroof. The Quattroporte I drove had neither. Yes, it comes with a new infotainment system with a high-resolution, 8.4” capacitive touch screen and a redesigned central console with rotary knob, but those already feel out of date. (That size of screen is relatively small when considering the 10- and 12-inch screens from others in the field, and the rotary knob felt thin and small compared with BMW’s iDrive and Merc’s futuristic knobs.) Remove the Bulge From the Foot WellsNew this year are a restyled front grille and LED light clusters at the rear.Here’s what driving a car for eight or 10 hours at a time will tell you that driving a car for an hour or less will not: Seemingly inconsequential design elements, such as the bulge along the bottom of the center console that juts out on either side of the center of the interior of the car into the foot wells—imagine them shaped like a lower-case “d”—can make you very uncomfortable over hours of driving. The Quattroporte has these, and their small protrusion disrupts the natural line of your leg as you sit. The result is you have to twist your hips and knees slightly to force your left leg (if you’re riding shotgun) unnaturally. It feels like when you sit in an economy airplane seat, and the carry-on bag under the seat in front of you prevents you from stretching your legs even to a simple straight line. Super irritating.Here’s another space-related note: It would be great if the seats were able to drop lower into the car. I had people in the Maserati who were 6’1’’ or so, and the extra headroom for those that height was minimal. The signature gills on the sides remain.The official word from Maserati is that the Quattroporte S Q4gets a combined 18mpg on the highway. (The company doesn’t list the city/highway mpg breakdown.) According to my readings over four days of heavy driving, the car I had averaged 14 mpg per day. When every brand is shifting to turbo-charging, smaller engines, and hybrid electric energy to comply with federal efficiency policies, this is not anywhere good enough. The disparity speaks to the broader issue here, which I believe the good folks at Maserati already know and are striving toward (after all, these things take time):In technology, engineering, and design, the brand needs to get with the program in a real way. Five operating modes (Auto Normal, Auto Sport, Manual Normal, Manual Sport, and Increased Control & Efficiency, or I.C.E.) allow for max control in any weather conditions.The car comes standard with blind-spot detection and collision warning systems. Lane departure and adaptive cruise control are optional on most models.

"Havana (AP) -- Powerful waves and storm surge from Hurricane Irma topped Havana's iconic Malecon seawall and left thousands of homes, businesses and hotels swamped Sunday, even as the storm moved away from the island.
There were no immediate reports of fatalities in Cuba, where the government prides itself on disaster preparedness and said it had evacuated more than 1 million people.
Authorities warned that the floodwaters could linger for more than a day, and there was as-yet uncalculated damage to sugarcane and banana fields in central Cuba and to northern cays studded with all-inclusive resorts, potentially dealing a major blow to the country's key tourism industry.
The storm ripped roofs off homes, collapsed buildings and caused floods along hundreds of miles of coast after cutting a trail of destruction across the Caribbean. Irma has killed at least 24 people in the region, leaving officials scrambling to bring aid to shattered communities.
In Havana, home to some 2 million residents, central neighborhoods along the coast between the Almendares River and Havana harbor suffered the brunt of the flooding, with seawater penetrating as much as a half-kilometer (one-third of a mile) inland in places.
Waves as high as 20 feet (6 meters) continued to pound Havana, with the spray topping the lighthouse at the Morro fortress on the entrance to the bay, and Civil Defense Col. Luis Angel Macareno warned that the flooding would persist into Monday.
Emergency workers and residents boated and waded through streets littered with toppled trees, downed electrical lines, roofs torn off by the winds and cement water tanks that fell from atop homes.
Elena Villar and her mother spent the night huddling in the lobby of a building on higher ground as her home of 30 years filled with more than 6 feet (2 meters) of water.
""I have lost everything,"" she said, on the edge of tears.
Floodwaters entered the high-end Melia Cohiba and Riviera hotels, where the storm damaged the buildings, landscaping and roofing.
Water and wind damaged the seaside U. S. Embassy, tossing around shipping containers that sit on the compound, smashing parts of its black perimeter fence, ripping exterior panels from the building and breaking windows and doors. The embassy's flag was in tatters fluttering from its staff Sunday.
Hector Pulpito recounted a harrowing night at his job as night custodian of a parking lot that flooded five blocks from the sea in the Vedado neighborhood.
""I felt great fear. This was the worst of the storms I have been through, and the sea rose much higher,"" Pulpito said. ""The trees were shaking. Metal roofs went flying.""
State television reported severe damage to hotels on the northern cays off Ciego de Avila and Camaguey provinces.
Witnesses said a provincial museum near the eye of the storm was in ruins, and authorities in the city of Santa Clara said 39 buildings collapsed.
The Communist Party newspaper Granma reported that the Jardines del Rey airport serving the northern cays was destroyed and posted photos to Twitter showing the shattered terminal hall littered with debris.
In Caibarien, a small coastal city about 200 miles (320 kilometers) east of Havana where many residents stayed put to ride out the storm, winds downed power lines and neighborhoods were under water.
In the well-known resort enclave of Varadero, on Cuba's north coast about two hours' drive east of Havana, hotels experienced only minor damage to structures such as windows and roofs, tourism official Ivis Fernandez told reporters.
Fernandez added that 17,000 tourists rode out the storm there, including more than 3,000 who were part of an evacuation of keys farther to the east that took a direct blow from Irma.
Similar scenes played out across the Caribbean, where the storm devastated islands before setting its sights on Florida.
In St. Martin, formerly lush green hills were stripped to a brown stubble and the smell of rotting debris spread across the French Caribbean territory of 40,000 people. Irma passed through earlier in the week as a Category 5 storm.
A truck drove through damaged neighborhoods distributing water, and authorities expected to set up distribution points Monday. Plans to do so were initially delayed by Hurricane Jose, which roared toward the region as a Category 4 storm Saturday but turned north without doing much further harm.
""Everything has been destroyed where I work. There's nothing there,"" Manon Brunet-Vita said as she walked through the streets of Grand Case. ""When I got to this neighborhood, I cried.""
More than 1,000 tons of water and 85 tons of food have been shipped to the French Caribbean territories of St. Martin and St. Barts, and additional deliveries are expected, according to government officials in the nearby island of Guadeloupe.
Authorities announced the reopening of St. Martin's Marigot port and said a boat was expected to dock by Monday with a 5-ton crane capable of unloading large containers of aid.
More police and soldiers were patrolling the streets following reports of looting, and authorities set up 1,500 emergency shelters.
On the Dutch side of St. Martin, an island divided between French and Dutch control, an estimated 70 percent of all homes were destroyed by Irma.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Sunday that the death toll in his country's territory had risen to four after the bodies of two unidentified people washed up on the island.
""Unfortunately, there are more victims to mourn,"" Rutte said.
With power out to much of the French Caribbean region, France's main electricity provider, EDF, said it has flown 140 tons of generators, pumps and other equipment to help St. Martin and St. Barts.
On St. Thomas in the U. S. Virgin islands, a convoy of FEMA trucks carrying water rumbled past damaged homes with sirens blaring.
William Mills, a security worker, said he waited in a mile-long line for gas. He said many were seeking to leave St. Thomas, but that was not an option for him.
""I'm going to stay here and tough it out,"" Mills said.

"TAPRON SPRING, Fla. -- Anthony Stansbury propped his rusty bike against a live oak tree and cast his fishing line into the rushing waters of Florida's Anclote River.
When he bought a house down the street last year, Stansbury says he wasn't told that his slice of paradise had a hidden problem. The neighborhood is adjacent to the Stauffer Chemical Co. Superfund site, a former chemical manufacturing plant that is on the list of the nation's most polluted places. That 130-acre lot on the river's edge is also located in a flood zone.
""Me and my kids fish here a couple times a week. Everyone who lives on this coast right here, they fish on this water daily,"" said the 39-year-old father of three.
Stansbury is among nearly 2 million people in the U. S. who live within a mile of 327 Superfund sites in areas prone to flooding or vulnerable to sea-level rise caused by climate change, according to an Associated Press analysis of flood zone maps, census data and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency records.
This year's historic hurricane season exposed a little-known public health threat: Highly polluted sites that can be inundated by floodwaters, potentially spreading toxic contamination.
In Houston, more than a dozen Superfund sites were flooded by Hurricane Harvey, with breaches reported at two. In the Southeast and Puerto Rico, Superfund sites were battered by driving rains and winds from Irma and Maria.
The vulnerable sites highlighted by the AP's review are scattered across the nation, but Florida, New Jersey and California have the most, and the most people living near them. They are in largely low-income, heavily minority neighborhoods, the data show.
Many of the 327 sites have had at least some work done to help mitigate the threat to public health, including fencing them off and covering them in plastic sheeting to help keep out rain water.
The Obama administration assessed some of these at-risk places and planned to gird them from harsher weather and rising seas. EPA's 2014 Climate Adaptation Plan said prolonged flooding at low-lying Superfund sites could cause extensive erosion, carrying away contaminants as waters recede.
President Trump, however, has called climate change a hoax, and his administration has worked to remove references from federal reports and websites linking carbon emissions to the warming planet.
""Site managers had started reviewing climate and environmental trends for each Superfund site, including the potential for flooding,"" said Phyllis Anderson, who worked for 30 years as an EPA attorney and associate director of the division that manages Superfund cleanups until her retirement in 2013. ""The current administration appears to be trying to erase these efforts in their climate change denials, which is a shame.""
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has said he intends to focus on cleaning up Superfund sites, and he appointed a task force that developed a list of sites considered the highest priority. The Stauffer site in Florida is not on it.
Like Mr. Trump, Pruitt rejects the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are driving global warming. His task force's 34-page report makes no mention of the flood risk to Superfund sites from stronger storms or rising seas, but eight of the 21 sites on EPA's priority list are in areas of flood risk.
Despite EPA's announced emphasis on expediting cleanups, the Trump administration's proposed spending plan for the current 2018 fiscal year seeks to slash Superfund program funding by nearly one-third. Congress has not yet approved new spending plans for the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.
Pruitt's office declined to comment this week on the key findings of AP's analysis or why the agency appears to no longer recognize an increasing flood risk to toxic sites posed by the changing climate.
However, Jahan Wilcox, an EPA spokesman, said, ""Despite fear-mongering from the Associated Press, not a single dollar has actually been eliminated, as Congress still hasn't passed a budget.""
Many flood-prone Superfund sites identified through AP's analysis are located in low-lying, densely populated urban areas. In New Jersey, several polluted sites have more than 50,000 people living within one mile.
In Hoboken, across the Hudson River from New York City, the site of a former manufacturing plant for mercury vapor lamps sits within a mile of almost 100,000 residents, including 7,000 children under 5.
The Martin Aaron Inc. Superfund site is in the heart of Camden's Waterfront South, a low-income neighborhood of crumbling row houses and industrial facilities stretching along the Delaware River.
The 2.5-acre lot, which takes up most of a city block, has been home to a succession of factories dating back to 1886 that included a leather tannery. The air around the fenced site hangs heavy with the nose-stinging odor of solvents. Testing found that soil and groundwater under the site contained a witch's brew of highly toxic chemicals, including PCBs and pesticides.
Earlier this month, workers used heavy machinery to remove contaminated soil and to pump polluted water from deep underground. Long range plans approved by EPA call for eventually covering the land and restricting its future use.
Just around the corner, Mark Skinner and his niece Cherise Skinner pushed her 1-year-old son in a stroller in front of their rented row house. Mark Skinner shrugged when asked about the work at the former industrial site.
""It's really contaminated, there's a lot of stuff in the ground, but I don't know what all it is,"" said Skinner, 53, who works at a nearby scrap metal yard and has lived in Waterfront South since he was a teenager.
Foul-smelling water filled the streets there during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, flooding many basements, long-time residents said. Census data show about 17,250 people live within a mile of the Martin Aaron site - 65 percent are black and 36 percent are Latino.
Across the nation, more than 800,000 homes are located near flood-prone toxic sites. Houses are at risk of contamination if intense flooding brings water into them, and many more people could be affected if the contamination seeps into the ground, finding its way into drinking water.
Mustafa Ali, who resigned in March as EPA's senior adviser and assistant associate administrator for environmental justice, said it's no accident that many of the nation's most polluted sites are also located in some of the poorest neighborhoods.
""We place the things that are most dangerous in sacrifice zones, which in many instances are communities of color where we haven't placed as much value on their lives,"" said Ali, who worked at EPA for 24 years.
The Stauffer site in Florida is a scrubby green field along the Anclote River, ringed on its other three sides by chain-link fences with ""No Trespassing"" signs. Testing showed the 130-acre lot's soils were contaminated with radium, the long-banned pesticide DDT, arsenic, lead and other pollutants that over the years have fouled the area's groundwater and the river.
Environmental regulators say the site now poses no threat to people or the environment because the current owner, the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, paid to treat contaminated soils, and cover the pollution with a ""cap"" of clean earth and grass. Still, residential development and use of groundwater on the site are prohibited because of the legacy pollution.
Covering toxic waste is often a cheaper option than completely removing the pollutants, but the installations are not always as long-lasting as the chemicals buried beneath them, said Jeff Cunningham, a civil engineering professor at the University of South Florida.
""As a long-term strategy, capping only works if the contaminants degrade to safe levels before the capping system eventually fails. What if it takes centuries for some of these contaminants to degrade to safe levels?"" Cunningham said.
Damage to a protective cap from storm-fueled flooding has already occurred at least once this year.
In October, the EPA said dioxins from the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund site near Houston were released after the cap was damaged by Harvey-related flooding. Tests afterward measured the toxins at 2,300 times the level that would normally trigger a new cleanup. Pruitt has since ordered an accelerated cleanup of the site.
Seventy-six-year-old Tony Leisner has lived near Florida's Stauffer chemical site all his life. He told the AP he is seeing damage to docks and riverside properties from the ever-rising waters in the neighborhood, and is concerned about what more flooding could mean for the Superfund lot. Although monitoring wells do test local groundwater for contamination from the site, some in Leisner's neighborhood said they're fearful enough to drink only bottled water.
The Anclote River is listed as an ""impaired waterway"" because it fails to meet state clean water criteria, though how much of that is due to the Stauffer site's legacy is unclear. The state has issued a warning about eating bass out of the river, but there are no signs at the popular fishing spot warning anglers even though tests show heightened levels of mercury in fish.
Leisner said barrels of chemicals at the Stauffer site self-ignited while crews were working. He said he's disappointed neither the company nor EPA removed the pollutants, especially since rising waters are already threatening the neighborhood.
""Burying things rarely helps. And if you've got a chemical that is that toxic ... I think you need to find a way to reuse, recycle and remove (it), to a place where it's not going to contaminate groundwater,"" he said.",0

Storm flooding destroyed hundreds of thousands of cars in a city that relies heavily on them            Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost.

The historic Harvey rains are gone. But it’s still hard to get from here to there on roads and rails in Beaumont and Port Arthur, Tex. (Lee Powell/The Washington Post)       Every single mode of transportation Katrina Chadbourne’s family owned was swallowed in Hurricane Harvey’s flooding. “My husband’s truck is gone,” Chadbourne said. “My daughter’s Lexus is gone. My husband’s Harley is gone.” A pair of water scooters went under as the flood climbed her front steps, and then a kayak was lost in a failed attempt to save the scooters. Her “baby,” a red 2015 Mustang GT, was the last hope, and it was sitting at the McRee Ford dealership 20 miles southeast of Houston, where it was receiving new tires on a service lot. But that, too, was a goner; the dealership was among the hardest hit in the region, losing 700 vehicles to the murky floodwaters. Harvey appears to be the most destructive event for cars in the nation’s history, based on early estimates, with floodwaters destroying hundreds of thousands of vehicles in a sprawling city that relies on them for much of its transportation. The loss is having an immediate impact, preventing many people from being able to return to work, sending craftsmen scrambling for new vehicles as they hope to rebuild the region, and leaving auto dealers who face millions of dollars in losses racing to restock amid unprecedented demand.  [Here’s how to deal with flooded cars]  “They say 500,000 total in Houston,” said Mitchell Dale, who owns McRee Ford, referring to initial estimates of how many cars were destroyed last week in the Houston area. Dale said his own automotive stock was worth about $28million, and almost all of it is destined for the crusher. “We’re looking at, probably, unrecoverable uninsured losses of somewhere between $1million and $1.5 million.”
Water-damaged vehicles on the sales lot at McRee Ford in Dickinson, Tex. on Friday. (John Taggart/For The Washington Post)  Harvey’s financial toll has drawn comparisons to Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, but because Houston is larger than New Orleans and the city’s storm was more brutal than Sandy, the region’s cars appear to have taken a bigger hit. Sandy destroyed about 250,000 vehicles and Katrina claimed about 200,000, according to estimates. Harvey ruined 300,000 to 500,000 cars and perhaps far more, early analysis indicates, leaving as much as $2.7billion to $4.9billion worth of automotive damage in its wake, according to Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.  [Trump administration wants to tie Harvey recovery aid to debt-ceiling legislation]  Houston is a metropolis crisscrossed by some of the nation’s widest freeways, plagued by some of the nation’s longest commutes and home to a culture that treats driving like a constitutional right. Driving here is not just a choice but a way of life. Not being able to drive is an extremely disruptive aspect of the widespread flooding here, keeping families at home, workers from their jobs, and much of the city’s recovery in limbo. For countless Houstonians like Chadbourne, 42, a crane operator who has no reliable way to get to work without her Mustang, the immediate outlook is dour. But for Chadbourne’s family, it’s perhaps even dangerous. Her 18-year-old daughter underwent a heart transplant and has a suppressed immune system, she said. The last time they had to call an ambulance, it took an hour to get to the hospital and the girl nearly died. “It’s all right,” Chadbourne said, steadying herself. “We’re alive.” While people wait for insurance money, the search to find a working car can be a desperate pursuit. Carolyn and Glen Roberts — who lost their house and three cars to Harvey — raced to an Enterprise rental car outlet in Port Arthur but found it flooded and closed. They tried another and scored a working car for the next week — a red Hyundai Sonata. “You can’t do anything without your car,” Carolyn Roberts said. But they were the lucky ones. Enterprise had more than 2,500 active reservation requests in this region alone. On a normal day, it might have 30. Workers for the rental agency said they were struggling to bring in more cars on trucks from branches across the country.    In an auto-dependent community where hundreds of thousands of residents are suddenly lacking transportation, how does the nation’s fourth-largest city get back on the road? Insurance claims take time, and auto dealerships have to get back up and running to meet demand. And with a vehicle ownership rate of 94.4percent, Smoke said, the metro Houston area is second only to Dallas-Fort Worth, which is a speck higher at 94.9percent. The parts of New York where Sandy hit has a vehicle ownership rate of 71percent. “Vehicles are a necessity in Texas,” said Marc Cannon, the executive vice president of AutoNation, home to 17 dealerships in Houston that reopened last week with minimal damage. “I don’t think we’ve ever seen a storm like this with the magnitude of the rain.” At McRee Ford, the week was a complete disaster, beginning with an early morning call on Aug.27 as floodwaters rose. “The night watchman called me at 6 a.m. and told me every vehicle in the lot was flooded and water was in the building,” Dale said. A neighbor took Dale and his son out on an airboat the next morning to see what had become of the business, which the family has operated for 70 years.  They drifted past rows of new pickups, some in water that reached the roof. The same was true for the used cars, as well as the customers’ cars in the service lot, one of which was Chadbourne’s Mustang. “I walked on the show floor,” Dale recalled. “I just said a prayer.” By Friday, as floodwaters had begun to retreat, insurance adjusters had arrived and they were eyeing the mud-streaked vehicles. The situation was bad: Cars that looked okay were useless under the hood because of destroyed electrical systems. Even with repairs, managers said, the vehicles would be unsafe to drive. Luis Sahagun, a spokesman for Farmers Insurance, said the company had received 9,000 auto claims at the end of last week. Asked to describe a typical payout after a flood, Sahagun said he couldn’t answer. “A car could be in six inches of water with minimal damage or six feet of water, where it’s a total loss,” he said. “There are so many variations in miles and models and conditions, as well. Each case is unique.” Jim Camoriano, a spokesman for State Farm, said the insurance giant had received 28,600 auto claims in Texas related to Harvey as of Saturday. An additional 910 claims had arrived from Louisiana and states as far away as North Carolina, he said, noting that 80 to 85percent of the Harvey claims are “total losses” and 75percent of the affected vehicles are no longer drivable. “We’ve got 10 catastrophe response vehicles on the ground and 1,000 people we’ve brought into our offices this weekend to process claims,” Camoriano said. “The way the storm just hovered over the Houston area for a few days, creating those massive rainfall totals, has made this a very significant event.”
The McRee Ford dealership in Dickinson, Tex., was hit hard by the storm. (John Taggart/For The Washington Post)   Houstonians need cars, and as residents begin to assess damage to their homes and vehicles, automakers are rushing to restock their inventory, experts said. They’re expecting another flood, they said, this one made up of customers browsing their lots with insurance money in hand. Some are comparing the post-Harvey “mad rush” to tax refund season. Dale said his managers were trying to restock through auctions, but there is no timeline: “We have no idea when we’ll be fully functional.” At AutoNation, while the company was still checking portions of its inventory for damage Friday, the sales force was back in business. “We’ve already sold 40 vehicles at AutoNation Ford of Katy in the last 24 hours,” Cannon said. “A lot of the people showing up are craftsmen who need to get back to work and they’re buying trucks and SUVs. They want to get Houston rebuilt.” The phones were still down at Philpott Motors in Port Arthur three days after the hurricane, but Mark Fiorenza, a sales consultant, was well aware that people all over Southeast Texas are “desperate for vehicles.” He said customers were calling and hearing a busy signal and figured the dealership was closed, so Philpott staff went on Facebook Live on Friday and encouraged people to contact them through social media or on cellphones to buy new cars and trucks. Fiorenza noticed something about customers since the hurricane: No one wants a car. “Everybody coming out wants a Jeep or truck,” Fiorenza said, noting that the problem is the dealership needs more trucks to sell. “We need them bad.”    Damaged cars at the McRee Ford lot. (John Taggart/For The Washington Post)  Phillip Sommer, the owner of Texas Auto, a used-car dealership with two locations in Houston, said the impending buying frenzy comes with some downsides. Dealerships are going to sell a lot of vehicles, he said, but the lack of inventory is going to drive prices up by several thousand dollars. Higher prices mean more challenges for buyers as they try to get auto loans, which are determined by blue-book value, not retail prices, he said. “Dealers are essentially going to be fighting to buy inventory at auctions, increasing the price,” Sommer said. “A lot of people assume that when prices are high dealers are making a killing, but we’re actually making less money.” The higher prices will create another obstacle for buyers, Sommer said: to stand out from the pack, some dealerships will be tempted to offer customers a deal by quietly hawking storm-salvaged vehicles full of hidden kinks.. “In this price-driven economy, people will be tempted to take the cheapest deal available and they’re going to get what they pay for,” he added. After Hurricane Katrina, the National Insurance Crime Bureau partnered with Louisiana state police to catalogue tens of thousands of damaged vehicles littering the Gulf Coast before they could reenter the auto market. Despite their exhaustive work, damaged Katrina vehicles were found in 26 states outside of the Gulf region within months of the storm, some as far away as New York and California, with snakes and alligators inside, according to the bureau. In Dickinson last week, Chadbourne found her baby — the red Mustang — and realized she’d have to say goodbye to it. A technician tried to open her car but gave up on getting the key to work. The car’s electrical system was fried and the door wouldn’t open. She decided she’d have to come back later to get CDs she’d left inside.

Many flood-damaged cars have ruined interiors and faulty electrical systems. (John Taggart/For The Washington Post)    Read more: With floodwaters rising and a rescue boat waiting, the urgent question: What to bring?   An adrenaline-driven mission on the dark, watery streets of Texas    Here’s how you can help people affected by Harvey  Frankel reported from Lake Charles, La., and Port Arthur, Tex. Holley reported from Washington.",0
"Fact: The total energy released through cloud and rain formation in an average hurricane is equivalent to 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity.
This astonishing fact comes by way of Christopher Landsea, a hurricane expert with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But how can atmospheric scientists possibly know how much energy a hurricane gives off? Obviously there's no thermometer big enough to measure the heat energy of a urikan, or ""big wind,"" as the Carib Indians who gave us the word knew them.
First you have to know how much rain comes down in your average hurricane (never mind why for the moment). For over 2,000 years, people measured rainfall with rain gauges. But bowls placed in the rain won't cut it for a hurricane. Fortunately, weather radars can. By bouncing electromagnetic radiation off rain or ice and calculating how much energy is returned, radars can give fairly accurate estimates of rainfall rates. A weather radar aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite can now do this across an entire hurricane.
Now for a few calculations. In 1981, William Gray, the nation's leading hurricane forecaster, published a paper stating that an average hurricane produces a little over half an inch of rain a day within a circular area 825 miles across. If you convert this to a volume of rain, Landsea notes, you get about 1.3 x 1015 cubic inches a day. That's enough rain to fill over 22 million Olympic-sized swimming pools!
Now, to figure how much energy is discharged when all that rain is produced, you have to use the so-called ""latent heat of condensation."" When water vapor cools sufficiently, it condenses into water droplets. Think of a cold can of soda on a hot day: water droplets appear on the outside because the thin layer of air surrounding the can is being cooled enough that all the water vapor in that layer condenses out. During that condensation process, it turns out, latent (stored) heat is given off.
When tropical meteorologists calculate using the latent heat of condensation, they find that the condensation of those 22 million Olympic pools worth of rain results in the release of 600 trillion watts of heat energy—or 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity as of January 1, 1996, according to U. S. Department of Energy figures.
Fortunately for those in the path of hurricanes, most of this energy goes into generating the storm's rising motions or gets expelled as a kind of ""cold exhaust"" in the upper layers of the atmosphere, some eight or ten miles up. Only a tiny portion of that total energy goes into cooking up the ferocious winds. ""A hurricane is a pretty inefficient heat engine,"" Landsea says. ""Only about a half percent of all the energy that's being released is actually captured by the hurricane to warm the air locally, lower the pressure, and spin the winds out.""
Yet as people in, say, Florida know all too well, that half percent still packs a wallop. Like 1,500,000,000,000 watts in the average hurricane—or fully half of the global electrical output.

"A Facebook user, Serena Kristiana Teakell, posted a copy of the video to her page alerting people to the graphic nature of the attack on the dog. The post was eventually deleted by Facebook but not before it received over 2,000,000 views, nearly 10,000 reactions and nearly 28,000 shares.
In her post, she said, “I’d like to introduce you to a little boy from the Waco area.” She continued saying she would like to “show you all what he and his friends think is cool to do to a dogs body. I have no idea how the dog died or who this kid is, but since he found it so funny and cool to post on this Snapchat, I figured he wouldn’t mind if I shared it with Facebook.”
After she received what was apparently some negative feedback about the post, she responded with her reasoning for why she offered it.
“I posted it because, as it goes with all things, when the public is outraged they can not turn a blind eye to the subject,” she wrote. At the very least, he will be shamed publicly and at the very least, everyone will be aware of his deep seeded psychological issues.”
She said the person who posted the video is not a kid. “He is an 18-year-old adult. I condescendingly called him a kid because his behavior is that of a young bratty sadistic child. He needs punishment and therapy,” she concluded.
The owner of thenearly 1-year- old pupnamed Elliesaid the dog went missing on Friday but he didn’t know what happened to her until she came across the video on Facebook in an interview with KVUE.
“A friend of mine posted a video on Facebook,” James Plant said to Rogers in the interview. Rogers said he clicked on the video and they showed the face of the dog. “I automatically knew offhand because of her eyes. She had one blue eye and one brown eye.” He said that distinctive eye color mismatch is not that common in her breed of dog.
“I froze up,” Plant said of his reaction to the video. He said his girlfriend had to take his phone away so he could not watch any more of the video.
“I was definitely horrified, to say the least,” a very emotional Plant said. Rogers asked Plant what might lead someone to do something like this. “Honestly, I don’t know what it is, but whatever it is, that person needs help,” he replied. “They need help bad because you shouldn’t do stufflike that–not to anything, ever.”
Ellie would have turned one-year-old in November.
This case is being investigated by detectives from the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office.",1

Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain.
No. 1: Rick Pitino, Louisville: $7,769,200 –
Pitino’s pay is boosted by more than $2.7 million in self-reported outside income that included $2.25 million from a personal services contract with Adidas. He’ll also get a $750,000 retention payment for remaining the school’s head coach on March 31.
No. 2: John Calipari, Kentucky: $7,435,376 – Calipari’s basic compensation from the school increased from last season by a previously scheduled $600,000. It is set to go up by another $350,000 next season. He reported nearly $300,000 in outside income.
No. 3: Mike Krzyzewski, Duke: $5,550,475 – Because Duke is a private school, Krzyzewski’s total is the one reported on the school’s most recently available federal income tax return, which covers pay for the 2014 calendar year, including benefits and bonuses. Duke’s return stated that $492,500 of Krzyzewski’s total had been reported as deferred compensation on prior years’ returns.
No. 4: Bill Self, Kansas: $4,932,626 – Self’s compensation has been virtually unchanged since 2012, when he received a roughly $1.3 million increase.
No. 5: Tom Izzo, Michigan State: $4,251,751 – Slight rises in both his pay from the school and from outside sources are resulting in Izzo’s total compensation increasing by about $100,000 compared to what he made last season. At his pay level, that’s an increase of slightly less than 2.5%.
No. 6: Bob Huggins, West Virginia: $3,590,000 – Huggins’ pay increased from last season’s by a previously scheduled $250,000. It’s set to go up by another $175,000 during his 2017-18 contract year. He remains eligible for a $25,000 bonus for a regular-season win over Kansas – which he’s gotten four times.
No. 7 John Beilein, Michigan: $3,370,000 – The terms of a new agreement that began in October 2015 are taking full effect during a contract year that ends April 15. The result is a pay increase from the school of nearly $530,000 over what Beilein received in 2015-16.
No. 8: Gregg Marshall, Wichita State: $3,035,500 – Working under a seven-year, rolling contract, Marshall saw his outside income decline by about $95,000 in the past year. But he’ll make that up soon, as his basic pay from the school is set to increase by $500,000 not long after the 2017-18 season.
No. 9: Scott Drew, Baylor: $2,818,811 – According to the private school’s most recently available tax records, Drew received more than $2.55 million in base compensation and $163,000 in bonus pay during the 2014 calendar year.
No. 10: Buzz Williams, Virginia Tech: $2,655,000 –  The school’s huge investment in Williams began paying dividends this season as the Hokies made the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2007. Williams’ predecessor, James Johnson, was making less than $640,000 from the school in his final season, 2013-14.
No. 11: Dana Altman, Oregon: $2,651,000 – Altman received a new seven-year contract and a $650,000 raise after leading the Ducks to the Elite Eight last season. This season, they reached the Final Four for the first time since 1939.
No. 12: Steve Alford, UCLA: $2,644,000 –
After last season, when the Bruins went 15-17, Alford renounced a one-year contract extension, through April 2021, that he’d been given in September 2014. He is not scheduled for any future pay increases.
No. 13: Sean Miller, Arizona: $2,610,000 – Miller’s compensation for this contract year is more than $2 million lower than it was for last year because he is not vesting further in a lucrative longevity fund. However, that vesting is scheduled to resume during his 2017-18 contract year.
No. 14: Mark Turgeon, Maryland: $2,577,054 – Turgeon received a new seven-year contract that was announced in late October 2016, months after the Terrapins’ first NCAA tournament round-of-16 appearance since 2003. The deal resulted in a pay increase of more than $200,000 and it calls for annual increases of 5%.
No. 15: Jay Wright, Villanova: $2,540,958 – The private school’s most recently available tax records showed that $2.47 million of Wright’s compensation for the 2014 calendar year was reported as base compensation.

"It’s a fair statement to say that at any one time, a large percentage of us are trying to lose weight. As a registered dietitian, I see this in my own practice — at least 50 percent or more of the individuals who come in to see me are doing so with the hopes of dropping at least 20 pounds.
It’s not easy, and many fall short of their goals. Their failures are not due to a lack of motivation or willpower; it’s often because they tried to make too many big changes all at once. Even their goals were too big. In fact, one study found making smaller and easier changes to eating habits on a regular basis was more likely to yield success in weight loss.
Almost everyone can make one small change every day. One major way you can push forward with weight loss is to cut calories. Here are my top swaps that have helped take my patients to the next level in their weight-loss goals:
Instead of having a high-calorie, high-sugar caramel latte, consider a coffee with unsweetened almond milk and cinnamon instead. You can whip up the almond milk and add tons of yummy flavors with the cinnamon, all while saving you over 1,600 calories a week, which could amount to over 20 pounds lost in one year!
This is an obvious one, but probably one of the most challenging to implement. We still are drowning in soda, and it’s costing us our health. But giving up a 12-ounce can of cola (140 calories) for water, or a naturally flavored seltzer water, can help you lose up to 14 pounds a year. Just make sure you resist the urge to cut calories by incorporating a diet version of your favorite cola. Artificial sweeteners may have consequences to your weight as well, according to several recent studies.
Eating zucchini noodles instead of pasta, just once a week, can help you lose over 2 pounds in a year — and making it all the time can lead to even further weight loss. This habit can be especially helpful for individuals with diabetes or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by decreasing the reliance on insulin.
Alcohol can be a real challenge when you’re trying to lose weight, but it can be the kiss of death if your alcohol of choice tends to be one that’s potentially loaded with sugar. Daiquiris, pia coladas and margaritas all fall into this category. Consider swapping your margarita for a 5-ounce glass or red or white wine just three nights a week and you can save you up to 1,000 calories a week, or 15 pounds in one year.
Swap high-calorie dressings for an amazing oil and balsamic vinegar combination to shave off about 3 pounds per year (that’s a lot to the serial dieter always looking to lose the last 5 pounds).
Think an oil and balsamic combo is boring? Think again. My view of salads and what goes on them completely changed when I found a specialty oil and vinegar store near my house. Now I whip up delicious masterpieces like blueberry balsamic paired with lemon olive oil, and quince balsamic paired with lime olive oil. I’ve fallen back in love with salads that were getting boring, and I fit better in my jeans because of it.
If I told you to swap your mid-afternoon bag of potato chips for some celery and hummus, you’d probably think I was crazy. So instead of having potato chips every afternoon, swap them for crunchy Parmesan crisps that you either make you or buy. While calories may differ by brands, some popular options I looked at showed a serving of potato chips running about 140 calories, while a serving of Parmesan chips having only 100 calories — and almost no carbs! That’s a potential savings of over 250 calories a week.
Cauliflower rice is found nationwide in either fresh or frozen versions and is easy to prepare. Plus, cauliflower is one of the best vegetables to consume if you’re interested in reducing your risk of cancer. If that doesn’t motivate you, then how about this: Cauliflower rice has 40 calories in one cup, while white rice has 170. That’s a saving of 130 calories! If you make that change just three times a week, you can save about 20,000 calories in a year.
Remember, weight loss is based on many variables — calories are only part of the equation. Genetics, activity level, gender, age and disease status all are factored into your ability to lose, or maintain weight. Despite this, small lifestyle changes, like swapping some of the foods suggested here, may help to move you in the right direction.

"A man who helped himself to cocaine that had washed up on a beach has been given a two year suspended sentence.
James Underhill, 34, of Charles Close, Caister, Norfolk, described the 50m find in a text message as ""Willy Wonka's golden ticket"".
The drugs haul was one of the largest ever found washed up on the UK coast.
Underhill admitted at an earlier hearing to being concerned in the supply of cocaine and possession of cannabis with intent to supply.
About 794lb (360kg) of cocaine washed up in holdalls on beaches at Caister-on-Sea and Hopton-on-Sea in February 2017, Norwich Crown Court heard.
Martin Ivory, prosecuting, said Underhill claimed to have found two one-kilo packages, each of which had already been broken into before he found them.
""The defendant, in his text messages to another individual, effectively said he had stumbled upon what he described as Willy Wonka's golden ticket and speculated he could be 20,000 to 30,000 better-off, based on what he found on the beach,"" he said.
Underhill used some of the cocaine himself, supplied some to others and was also found to have 5,000 of cannabis in a safe.
Judge Maureen Bacon QC sentenced Underhill to two years in prison suspended for two years and ordered he take part in a drug rehabilitation programme.
She described Underhill's actions as ""opportunistic"" and that the amount of cocaine he had was ""perhaps not as high as a whole kilogram"".
Andrew Oliver, mitigating, described Underhill as a ""somewhat pathetic and heavy user of cannabis and crack cocaine"" who happened upon an undetermined quantity of cocaine and supplied some of it and consumed some of it.",0
"IRBIL, Iraq — U. S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter spent a second day in Iraq Sunday, this time assuring Kurdish leaders that the coalition will provide the necessary air resources to help their forces liberate Mosul — while also warning that the international community needs to be prepared to reconstruct the Iraq's second largest city.
""We need to make sure that the non-military campaign doesn't lag behind the coalition,"" said Carter, who added that he's ""encouraged by the progress"" of the military campaign. ""My mind is already thinking ahead to the desperate need for stabilization and reconstruction.""
While in Irbil, roughly 24 miles from the front lines, Carter told the prime minister of the Kurdish Regional Government, Necheran Barzani, on Sunday that the coalition will provide the necessary air resources to take back Mosul.
Related: Mosul: Who Are Key Players Trying to Recapture ISIS Stronghold?
The Iraq-led offensive against ISIS in Mosul is entering its seventh day, with Iraqi counter terrorism units and the Kurdish peshmerga encountering increased resistance from as many as 7,000 fighters.
Coalition forces could face fiercer combat as they get closer to the city's center, where U. S. officials expect an estimated 1,000 foreign fighters to mount a last stand.
Carter is also focusing his attention on how to defend Europe and America from potential counter-strikes by the group, also known as the Islamic State in Iraq, as the territory they control in the Middle East shrinks.
""I am very watchful about attacks on the homeland,"" Carter said in Baghdad Saturday. ""My job is to make sure Americans sleep at night and that is what keeps me up at night.""
Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the U. S.commander of the coalition in Baghdad, said that the resistance has ""stiffened in the last couple of days."" He added on Sunday that Barzani and his own sources reported that the peshmerga had ""considerable success"" in recapturing Bashiqa, a town near Mosul.
Nonetheless, Townsend said that ISIS is attempting to direct the attention of coalition forces away from the campaign on Mosul. ""We have seen a complex attack on Rutbah,"" he said, referring to the city about 265 miles west of Baghdad. The assault follows a similar attack recently on the city of Kirkuk.
As an example of the ISIS' unconventional tactics, U. S. officials cited a sulfur factory north of U.S. military staging positions that the terrorist group set on fire earlier this week. When the wind shifted to the south on Saturday, hazardous fumes blew towards a a coalition base, known as Q-West, south of Mosul.
Almost 1,000 people suffered from breathing problems related to toxic gases from the fire, Reuters reported, with victims arriving for treatment as early as Friday. Some soldiers donned gas masks, while air samples were sent the U. S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency for analysis.
Some Kurdish combat forces had complained that they were not receiving the air support that they expected from the coalition, but a Kurdish official said Sunday that the situation had improved. ""Now we have good support,"" said Kurdish Brig. Gen. Halgord Hekmet.
""Our number one request is armored vehicles,"" he said. ""Most peshmerga got killed because they are riding in normal cars."" Twenty five peshmerga have been killed since the operation began, Hekmet added.
While officials insist that Iraqi forces are taking the lead, more Americans are in harm's way. On Thursday, Navy Chief Petty Officer Jason Finan, a 34-year old from Anaheim, California, was the first to American to be killed since the campaign began.
His death ""underscores a fact, which is what we are doing over here and what you are doing, is serious business,"" Carter said. ""It's not a game.""
Between 100 and 200 U. S. special forces are working to help the advance of Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Approximately 5,000 American military personnel are in the country, with roughly 500 outside of U.S. bases.
As Iraqi and Kurdish forces fight through the outer ring of ISIS' defense in Mosul, facing vehicle-borne suicide bombers and burning trenches of oil, U. S. military planners are confident of victory and already looking towards toppling Raqqa, the ISIS' capital in Syria.
Meanwhile, Carter has also been attempting to mediate a dispute between Turkey and Iraq on how involved Turkish forces will be in Mosul. After meeting with Turkey's president in Anakara on Friday, Carter said that he had ""an agreement in principle"" on Turkey's role in the campaign.
But in Baghdad, he appeared to dial down those aspirations and said the Iraqi government essentially had vetoed Turkish participation. ""I also affirmed to you today the vital importance of every country operating with full respect to Iraqi sovereignty,"" Carter said after meeting with Prime Minister Haider al-Badi.",0
"House Representative Charles Rangel has introducedHR 748that will “require all persons in the United States between the ages of 18 and 25 to perform national service, either as a member of the uniformed services or as civilian service in a Federal, State, or local government program or with a community-based agency or community-based entity, to authorize the induction of persons in the uniformed services during wartime to meet end-strength requirements of the uniformed services, to provide for the registration of women under the Military Selective Service Act, and for other purposes.”
HR 748 has been brought forth to theHouse Armed Services Committee(HASC) areinstrumentalin the implementation of the annual defense authorization bill; as well as the functionality of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Energy (DoE).
Mainstream propaganda supports the idea of national service byadmonishingAmericans that if our Constitutional Republic is to survive we need to give our consent to the government to govern us and actively participate in our freedom in order to remain free.
The connotation is the “diversity seems to breed distrust and disengagement” which is the antithesis of a communal foundation. The answer “is universal national service . . . that is in our enlightened self-interest as a nation.”
By devoting “a year or more to national service, whether military or civilian, should become a countrywide rite of passage, the common expectation and widespread experience of virtually every young American.” In this way, every American “can harness the spirit of volunteerism that already exists and make it a permanent part of American culture.”
Senator John McCain supports the idea of national service. McCain explains: “National service is an issue that has been largely identified with the Democratic Party and the left of the political spectrum. That is unfortunate, because duty, honor and country are values that transcend ideology…National service is a crucial means of making our patriotism real, to the benefit of both ourselves and our country.”
National service could be implemented with a 10-point plan that would include:
A federal government investment of funds to every American born that could be collected after a year of national military service.
Presidential oversight of theCorporation for National and Community Service(CNCS) to make sure all Americans participate by the year 2016.
Expansion of national-service programs in public schools to coerce younger generations to serve their country as a part of national patriotism.
Create an Education Corps to oversee public schools and encourage national service.
Devise a Summer of Service program to engage youth to participate in national service events and keep them nationalized.
Enroll all participants in a government-sponsoredhealth insuranceprogram to assist healthcare professionals and caseworkers in servicing communities.
Revive FDR’sCivilian Conservation Corps(CCC) under a Green Corps (GC) initiative to improve infrastructure and combat climate change as a national issue.
Create a Rapid-Response Corps to assist the National Guard during disasters regarding preparedness and emergencies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) could oversee this endeavor.
Create aNational-Service Academythat would educate American youth on federalist ideals with a focus on expanding the philosophy that national service to a nation is necessary for its continuation.
TheEdward M. Kennedy Serve America Act of 2009(EKSAA) is the stratagem that is the basis of volunteerism that is government mandated. When Obama signed the EKSAA, he expected Americans to take communitarianism to heart and act accordingly. Obama said: “We need your service, right now, at this moment in history. . . I’m asking you to stand up and play your part. I’m asking you to help change history’s course. Put your shoulder up against the wheel. And if you do, I promise you – your life will be richer, our country will be stronger, and someday, years from now, you may remember it as the moment when your own story and the American story converged, when they came together, and we met the challenges of our new century.”
This initiative employs citizen battalions of government trained Americans, ages 18 – 24, to serve with the federal government in a new generation of emergency managers.
In 2009, President Obamasaidthat: “We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we’ve set. We’ve got to have a civilian national security force that’s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.”
Intimating that the internal affairs of the US necessitate a civilian army because America’s security was threatened from within harkens to dictators of the past that created their own youth groups of trained citizens that were brainwashed into believing that continuity of government supersede basic adherence to fundamental human rights, i.e. Hitler’s Youth Group.
In developing a civilian corps, the US government created theCommunity Emergency Response Teams(CERT) that take neighborhood watches and regular citizens and turn them into basic responders to disaster scenarios with workshops and training exercises.
This concept was beta-tested by the Los Angeles City Fire Department (LAFD) in 1985. After the Whittier Narrows earthquake in 1987, the LAFD decided to train citizens and government employees in disaster response training. FEMA and other agencies of the US government have taken this concept into their own hands by creating a federalized and state-controlled version to set clear priories and dispense responders in any given disaster situation.
Under CERT, citizens are trained and approved by FEMA to access the resources of any given community, partner with local law enforcement, recruit participants and infiltrate community groups to further indoctrinate the public as to knowing specifically how the federal government wants Americans to respond during a disaster.
Last year FEMA Corps released 231graduatesthat were trained by CNCS to conduct community relations and Disaster Recovery Center Support in cities all across the nation.
These graduates were educated on how to utilize local communities for the sake of public-private partnerships to rework the structure of those communities to serve the needs of the federal government. By implanting pro-government propaganda, using rural resources for the benefit of private sector corporations under the guise of “fostering civic engagement”, the CNCS revisions the American landscape to reflect their agendas as directed by the US government.",1
"Too often, it seems, rappers make headlines for their bad behavior. So let's have a look at 10 hip-hop stars who have used their influence to make the world a little nicer.

2 Chainz hosts the annual ugly sweater contest, on ""Good Morning America,"" in December 2015.
No lie, Atlanta's Titi Boi is a serious philanthropist. Not only did he reportedly raise $2 million in 2015 through sales of his ""Dabbin' Santa"" ugly Christmas sweaters, but he announced that he was looking for needy families to spend it on.
Some of that money went to buying furniture and paying a year's worth of rent for an unemployed single mother and disabled veteran from his hometown of College Park, Georgia. He also bought a minivan for a family who lost their home in a fire and provided a five-bedroom home for a year to a family of 11.
2 Chainz has attributed his charitable nature to never forgetting the hardships he endured as a kid: ""I remember when we didn't have hot water and I didn't want my friends to know, so I told them it was something wrong with that bathroom and they couldn't use my mommas, i remember using the oven to heat the house, I would stand in the kitchen for hours to stay warm.""

In what might have been a little charitable ... gamesmanship, Los Angeles' The Game last year mocked singer Madonna's and comedian Jimmy Fallon's $10,000 donations to help with the Flint, Michigan, water crisis. He then showed ""How We Do"" by vowing via Instagram to donate $1 million worth of water and posted a wire receipt showing he had already handed over half that amount.
The 37-year-old's The Robin Hood Project has been helping people ever since The Game encountered a Nigerian man in Australia sharing a one-bedroom apartment with 20 people. He wanted to help the gentleman, but had only 20 Australian dollars on him at the time.
""So, I gave him the 20 and for the next week I couldn't sleep,"" he said. ""I just wanted to help, you know? I wanted to do more. So, I came up with the idea of The Robin Hood Project.""

During a 2006 telethon for hurricane relief, she kicked in $100,000 to help victims of Katrina.
In addition to contributing to LGBT, senior citizen, civil rights and anti-bullying efforts, Latifah's helped a variety of other groups, including veterans. In June 2015, she gifted the version of national anthem that she performed a few months earlier at the NBA All-Star Game to Fisher House, which provides ""comfort homes"" to the families of hospitalized veterans. The organization sold the single for download and streaming and used the proceeds to help military families.

The ""Born Sinner"" certainly atones with generosity. Though he moved to New York after high school, J. Cole never forgets his hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina.
Prior to the 2013 school year, he kicked off a tradition of donating school supplies -- including backpacks, notebooks and pens -- and he announced that his old Fayetteville home, made famous on the cover of his album, ""Forest Hills Drive,"" would serve as rent-free transitional housing for single mothers in the Cackalack.
The 32-year-old's annual Dreamville Weekend focuses on uplifting the Fayetteville community with an appreciate dinner, a career panel of African-American professionals and events honoring community leaders. It's all part of the effort to help urban youth ""have a dream, believe in their dream and achieve their dream.""

The ""Get Back"" rapper gives back, that's for sure. When flooding hit Atlanta in 2009, he donated to recovery efforts and handed out more than 500 coats to students who had found their homes and school underwater. When he learned Venetian Hills Elementary School had gone years without a playground, he helped build one. After Typhoon Haiyan, he gave generously to the United Nations agency scurrying to feed the battered Philippines.
""We were put on this Earth to help others. All you blessed people go bless someone else,"" the three-time Grammy winner has said. Through his eponymous charity and other outlets, Luda has followed up on those words, taking on a litany of causes, including cancer, the environment, at-risk youth, AIDS, human trafficking, poverty and literacy.

Not many rappers have been called a ""humanitarian genius"" in the UN Dispatch. But Fitty earned the moniker in 2012 after announcing he would donate a billion meals to the UN World Food Program. At 10 cents a meal, that meant $100 million, which the rapper said would come from sales of his Street King energy drinks. He even visited Kenya and Somalia to better understand the hunger problems facing those countries.
Back home, the Queens native's G-Unity Foundation has worked to lift up impoverished Americans, while the rapper has teamed up with Feeding America to deliver food to hungry children.
Last year, he fell out of many fans' good graces when he filmed himself teasing an autistic janitor he thought was stoned. He issued an apology, as well as a $100,000 check to Autism Speaks.

Oh, where to begin with Sean Combs? There's the time he pulled the Boys & Girls Club of Harlem from insolvency with a $60,000 donation. Or perhaps the time he raised $2 million for children's charities running the New York Marathon. How about when he gave his alma mater, Howard University, $1 million for business scholarship and internships?
He also sits on the board of the Hip-Hop Action Summit, and has been quick to ""Blow a Check"" on a variety of charities, including the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship and the i.am Scholarship fund. After a superstorm slammed the northeast United States in 2013, Combs co-hosted the Superstars for Sandy Relief party, which raised $524,742.",0
"Businesses hired at a brisk pace in November, adding 228,000 jobs, the Labor Department reported Friday. It's a sign of the economy's continued strength in its eighth year of expansion. The unemployment rate was unchanged, at 4.1 percent.
Some 46,000 jobs were added in the professional and business services sector, and manufacturing was surprisingly strong, producing 31,000 new jobs. Health care added 30,000 jobs, on par with its monthly average this year.
The year has seen an average of 174,000 new jobs created every month, down from 187,000 the year before.
Hourly earnings grew 2.5 percent year-over-year, a slightly faster pace than in prior months but still more slowly than would be typical during an economic expansion at this stage. The last time unemployment was this low, wages were rising at a 4 percent rate.
""Given that the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent and the expansion is more than eight years old, it's disappointing that wage growth isn't stronger,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist with PNC Financial Services Group, in a note.
One reason could be that labor turnover is lower than it's been in the past--muting the effects of high employment.
""Though we've been getting people into jobs, once they get here, there's not moving around as much,"" said Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. ""The issue is, you really need competition over talent to drive wages up.""
Other figures suggest workers are still in demand, said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide. ""Increases in temporary workers rose to the highest level of the year, while average weekly hours worked rose to 34.5 – both suggesting that the demand for workers continues to rise,"" he said in a statement.
The economy is expanding at a healthy pace, and in many cases employers are scrambling to hire enough qualified workers. Over the past six months, growth has exceeded an annual rate of 3 percent, the first time that's happened since 2014. Consumer confidence has reached its highest level since 2000.
The White House took credit for the strong figures and promised more boom times ahead, saying ""President Trump's bold economic vision continues to pay off.""
""With tax reform moving quickly through Congress, confidence in the strength of our economy remains high and families around the country are reaping the benefits,"" said Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in a statement. ""As we continue to unleash the American economy from unnecessary regulation and taxes, we look forward to seeing more reports like this, showing a healthy and thriving jobs market for the American people.""
How much influence the president really has on the economy is a matter of debate. While the prospect of corporate and individual tax cuts has bolstered stock prices, the broader economic picture depends much more on factors including Federal Reserve policy and the global economy than by the occupant of the White House.
November's solid job figures keeps the Federal Reserve on track to raise its benchmark interest rate at its policy meeting next week. The central bank is widely expected to continue raising short-term rates despite inflation remaining below its 2 percent target.
""Given the potential impacts of the tax bill and the already established momentum of the economy, accelerating in recent months, there may well be a price to be paid in the form of rising interest rates at the hand of the Federal Reserve,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economist at Bankrate, in a note. ""The central bank has been eager to continue along the path of normalization and the case is made all the more pressing with the rise in stock and home prices.""

"A Florida woman recently thought that she had come up with the perfect form of discipline to punish her much younger, 9-year-old cousin. Unfortunately for the obese woman, things went horribly wrong— and now, she’s going to jail for murdering an innocent little girl.
All hell broke loose on Saturday as police received a call about an unresponsive child in a Pensacola home. However, when first responders arrived, they were horrified by what they saw after entering the residence.
As it turns out, a 9-year-old girl named Derickawas dead on the floor. Even worse yet, the girl’s cousin admitted that she lost consciousness during a bit of “discipline.” According to Mail Online, Veronica Green Posey, the girl’s 64-year-old cousin, was tired of the girl’s “misbehaving” and sought to correct it with a horrid form of punishment.
After questioning everyone involved, police quickly pieced together what happened, leading up to the final moments of Dericka’s short life. In fact, Pensacola News Journal reports that the 9-year-old child was first chased around the house with a ruler before being struck with it.
Posey then grabbed a metal pipe and began to beat her much younger cousin with it as well, until the child fled and eventually sought refuge on a nearby armchair. Little did she know, her 325-pound cousin wasn’t done with her yet and continued the pursuit until she eventually caught up to the child – but that’s when things took a turn.
In a horrific act, the massive woman decided that the best form of punishment for Dericka was for the obese adult woman to sit on the young child. Just like that, Posey plopped down right on top of the girl, putting a severe amount of strain all across her little torso with the older woman’s massive amount of weight.
Although the girl was able to deal with the punishment for a few minutes, Posey states that after about 10 minutes, her niece began to complain of difficulty breathing. Despite this reality, the fat woman stayed seated for an additional two minutes before getting up and finding Dericka unresponsive.
Making matters worse, the two people listed as Dericka’s parents — Grace JoanSmith, 69, and James Edmund Smith, 62 – were there the entire time. Rather than put an end to the abuse, the two reportedly just sat and watched as their purported daughter was murdered right in front of them by another family member.
Now, Posey is being charged with homicide and cruelty toward a child while Dericka’s parents, the Smiths, have each been slapped with a child neglect charge as well. Posey’s bond was set at $125,000, and she has been released. Grace Smith’s bond was set at $75,000, and James Smith’s bond was set at $50,000. As of 3 p.m. Monday, jail records showed the two were still in jail.I hate to say it, but it is times like this that I wish people would be put to death in the same way they killed someone else.
Of course, you have to address the elephant in the room — and we’re not talking about Posey. The last time someone died similarly to this, chants of “black lives matter” filled the air. This time, there are no protests for Dericka who also died while struggling to breathe. Then again, the previous incident involved cops and a resisting criminal, so it had political currency. This case, on the other hand, involved a black woman killing a black child, and sadly, it becomes clear those same people aren’t chanting for her life, which definitely did matter.
The BLM types are all sitting comfortably at home since they can’t try to capitalize on any of this. It just doesn’t fit their narrative. Of course, all that does is prove that the so-called “movement” is nothing more than a farce and a crutch meant to blame whitey and law enforcement for everything. Maybe if black activists actually showed that they cared about black lives, they’d try to do something about all the people within their communities who clearly don’t value other black lives.That would be a great place to start to make real change that matters.",1
"Vivid, detailed maps created during the unsuccessful hunt for MH370 have been published by investigators to shed light on the depths of remote and previously unexplored parts of the ocean.
The maps reveal the location and scale of under-sea volcanoes, ridges, mountains and shipwrecks found on the floor of the Indian Ocean.
A painstaking two-year search of the sea bed ended in January without finding the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, which vanished in March 2014 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board.
But data gathered during surveys of some 46,000 square miles of the waters west of Australia could provide oceanographers and geologists with unprecedented insight.
Among the information released to the public Wednesday by Geoscience Australia is an interactive map of suspected debris from the doomed jet and the location where it was found.
The data also includes three-dimensional models of undersea landforms as well as raw bathymetric survey information. A further tranche of data is due to be published next year.
“It is estimated that only 10 to 15 percent of the world's oceans have been surveyed with the kind of technology used in the search for MH370, making this remote part of the Indian Ocean among the most thoroughly-mapped regions of the deep ocean on the planet,"" Stuart Minchin, chief of Geoscience Australia's environmental geoscience division, said in a news release.
The information should also give insight to deep-sea fishermen into the region, said Charitha Pattiaratchi, professor of coastal oceanography at the University of Western Australia, told Reuters.
""There are the locations of seamounts which will attract a lot of international deep sea fishermen to the area,"" Pattiaratchi said.
High-priced fish such as tuna, toothfish, orange roughy, alfonsino and trevally are known to gather near the seamounts, where plankton swirl in the currents.
Australia has not ruled out resuming the search for MH370 but officials have said that would depend on finding ""credible new evidence"" about the plane's whereabouts.
""No new information has been discovered to determine the specific location of the aircraft and the underwater search remains suspended,"" Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester said in a statement Wednesday.",0
"Hundreds of thousands of young people are in the process of applying to university, in time for a 2018 start. Their choices can make a huge difference to future earnings.
For most university graduates, having a degree pays.
Over the course of a lifetime, estimates suggest women can expect to earn about 250,000 more if they have a degree, while the figure is roughly 170,000 for men.
In England, higher tuition fees mean that, on average, students graduate with debts of more than 50,000 - much more than their counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
But repayments are only one of many factors which affect how much money graduates will have in their pockets in years to come.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, there are big differences in the earnings of graduates from different universities.
Five years after graduation, average annual earnings for students who were taught at the London School of Economics, Imperial College London and University of Oxford are more than 40,000.
Graduates of the 24 Russell Group universities earn an average of 33,500 after five years - about 40% more than those who studied at other universities.
At the other end of the scale, there are several institutions - many of them dance and drama colleges - where average earnings after five years are closer to 15,000.
Importantly, many of the differences here are not down to the universities themselves.
They have different average earnings partly because students aren't all the same - they have different abilities and interests.
Entrants to Oxford, LSE and Russell Group universities start their degrees, on average, with better exam grades, for example.
The big decision about what to study at university can be very important for future earnings.
Five years after graduation, the income gap between students who studied the subjects that attract the highest and lowest salaries can be considerable.
Graduates of medicine and dentistry earn an average of 46,700, while those who studied economics take home 40,000.
These figures are about double the average wages of creative arts (20,100), agriculture (22,000) and mass communication (22,300) graduates.
Crucially, these differences are smaller, but remain significant, even when students with similar A-level grades are compared.
As careers progress the gaps get bigger, with graduates of the high-earning subjects pulling even further away.
For example, students of law, economics and management subjects at the London School of Economics do extremely well, with 10% of male graduates earning more than 300,000 by the time they are in their early 30s.
A number of factors influence graduate earnings long before they get as far as choosing which course to study, or which university to attend.
In particular, the reality is that male graduates earn more than female graduates.
The gap can already be seen only one year after graduation, when men earn an average of 1,500 (8%) more than women per year.
After five years, the gap has increased to around 3,500, or 14%.
This is likely to continue to increase with age, but it should be noted that that this gap is less than half that experienced by non-graduates.
Some - but by no means all - of this difference can be explained by differences in subject choices, with women more likely to choose courses with low earnings potential.
For example, creative arts, nursing, psychology and social science all have far more female than male students, while the opposite is true for architecture, computing and engineering.
However, a large part of this difference cannot be explained away by personal choice.
The social background of students also matters.
Those from better off households are much more likely to go to university.
They are also much more likely to go to more selective universities.
That is a large part of the reason why male graduates from households with incomes above 50,000 earn about 20% (7,000) more than their university peers from lower income households, by the time they are in their early 30s.
Among women, there is a 16% (4,000) gap between these households.
Remarkably though, even when comparing students who did the same subject at the same university, those from the richest households still earn around 10% more than their peers from less affluent backgrounds.
This suggests improving access to university alone is not enough to address issues of social mobility.
The increase in tuition fees to 9,250 per year in England has significantly increased the level of debt students graduate with - and the repayments many will make over their careers.
Most will in fact not pay back all of the cost of their tuition, with the taxpayer picking up the difference.
Recent changes have offered some respite to those who go on to have low earnings.
Graduates only ever have to pay 9% of their income above a given threshold, regardless of the size of their debts.
The threshold will rise from 21,000 to 25,000 in April 2018, putting more money in the pockets of significant numbers of graduates.
Over the course of their working lives, this could save graduates up to 15,700 in student loan repayments.
It also means that more than 40% of graduates are now expected to repay less than they would have had there been no changes to the student loan system since 2011.
And, for eight out of 10 graduates, it is likely that they will get to the end of their working lives having never paid off that loan.

"A study of almost 600,000 people has found that some have natural born ‘superhero DNA’ that enables their bodies to cancel out genetic disease.
Out of the 600,000 people who took part in the study, 13 of them were found resistant to debilitating diseases.
Experts said the approach, published in Nature Biotechnology, was “fascinating” but that it was still early days.
Errors in our code of life – our DNA – can cause disease.
Large numbers of studies have tried to understand these mutations by looking at people who become ill.
But the international team of researchers tried the opposite approach – searching for people harbouring damaging mutations but who remain healthy.
“Millions of years of evolution have produced far more protective mechanisms than we currently understand,” said Dr Eric Schadt from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.
He added: “Most genomic studies focus on finding the cause of a disease, but we see tremendous opportunity in figuring out what keeps people healthy.”
The researchers scoured DNA databases containing information on 589,306 people.
They found 13 healthy people who should have developed one of eight genetic diseases: cystic fibrosis, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, familial dysautonomia, epidermolysis bullosa simplex, Pfeiffer syndrome, autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome, acampomelic campomelic dysplasia and atelosteogenesis.
The report said the diseases were so severe that it was “highly unlikely that such an individual would have manifested the disease without it being clearly annotated in their health records”.
Prof Stephen Friend, from the Icahn School of Medicine, said: “Finding these individuals is a starting point to searching for the other changes, eg in the genome, that might give us clues to develop therapies.
“Study the healthy, don’t just study the sick.”
However, this is where the tantalising story ends. The scientists were unable to go out and find the lucky 13 because of the consent rules signed when their DNA sample was taken.
It means they do not know what is protecting them against disease.
It also leaves the team unable to prove that errors in testing, bad record keeping or mosaicism – in which the genetic defect affects only some cells in the body – are not behind their findings.
“Because of the inability to confirm the source or validity of the variants and the inability to recontact the individuals, this paper does not constitute a proof of principle,” Dr Ada Hamosh, from Johns Hopkins University, argued.
And while Dr Scott Hebbring, from the University of Wisconsin, described the study as “fascinating” he also cautioned that diseases can present very differently even between patients that have same mutations.
Some may have few symptoms at all.
The research group is aiming to do a new study from scratch where patients can be traced. It also argues that other forms of protection – from infections to dementia – could be detected through this approach.
Dr Daniel MacArthur, from the Massachusetts General Hospital, said: “Finding genetic superheroes will require other kinds of heroism – a willingness of participants to donate their genomic and clinical data and a commitment by researchers and regulators to overcome the daunting obstacles to data sharing on a global scale.”
Dr Matthew Hurles, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said the study “exemplifies the often unforeseen benefits that can be achieved from responsible sharing of anonymised genetic and clinical data”.
However, he added: “The full benefits of such altruistic data sharing is only fully realised when it becomes possible to go back to the resilient individual to try to understand how their resilience is achieved.
“This poses research and ethical questions. Personally, if I were that individual, I’d happily share my genome if it could help someone else who had been dealt a less favourable genetic hand.”",1
"America’s most influential pro-Israel lobby group, AIPAC is hosting its annual policy conference in Washington next week.
All the presidential candidates were invited and all will be attending, except for one: Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who also happens to be the only Jewish candidate ever to win a presidential primary.
Mr Sanders said he would be unable to attend because of his campaign schedule.
“I would very much have enjoyed speaking at the AIPAC conference,” Sanders said in a letter released to AIPAC’s President Robert Cohen on Friday.
His decision not to attend happened to follow a petition campaign which was endorsed by Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters, although the Sanders campaign did not say whether it had responded to the petition
Prominent journalist Max Blumenthal, who specializes in Israel-Palestine, created a petition calling on Sanders to reject AIPAC’s invitation to its conference.
“As the main arm of the pro-Israel lobby in the United States, AIPAC has sworn to promote the racist, militaristic, and anti-democratic policies of the most right-wing government in Israel’s history,” Blumenthal wrote in a description accompanying the petition. “Its conference this year will feature Islamophobes, anti-immigrant activists, and religious extremists.”
“With his promise to seek a “level playing field” on Israel-Palestine, Berniedoes not belong on the same stage as these figures,” Blumenthal added.
As of Friday, the petition had more than 5,000 signatures. Musician Roger Waters, formerly of band Pink Floyd, endorsed it. Waters has established himself as a leading activist on behalf of Palestinian human rights.
The group RootsAction also disseminated the petition, and got an additional 14,000 signatures.
Salon reached out to Blumenthal, who characterized Sanders’ decision as a victory for the Palestinian human rights movement.
He emphasized the importance of garnering almost 20,000 petitions in a brief period of time, “with little media coverage, and on an issue that has been little-discussed in the debates.”
“Regardless of any spin he’s offering, I think Sanders recognized that sharing a stage with bigots at AIPAC and apartheid lobbyists would be anathema to his hardcore base of support,” Blumenthal explained.
“This is a demonstration of the growing grassroots impact of Palestine solidarity and a sign of things to come in the future: self-styled progressive politicians will be punished for supporting Israeli apartheid,” he added.",1
"One of the 520 victims injured in Sunday’s Las Vegas massacre has lost her right eye and is in a coma in a hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU). Tina Frost, who was attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival with her boyfriend when a gunman opened fire on the crowd from his 32nd floor hotel room at Mandalay Bay, is listed as critically stable, and is currently on a ventilator.
“Tina is out of surgery and her vitals are stable,” Mary Watson Moreland, the 27-year-old woman’s mother, said, according to a GoFundMe page. “They removed her right eye, where the bullet was lodged, and there is an implant there now to keep the space open. She has sight in her left eye but will never see from the right again.”
DURING LAS VEGAS SHOOTING, HEROES RISKED LIVES TO SAVE OTHERS IN 'KILL ZONE'
Moreland said doctors were forced to remove a bone from her daughter’s forehead to relieve brain swelling, and that they plan to see how she responds to simulation over the next few days to assess brain damage. The GoFundMe page, which was set up on Monday, raised more than $100,000 in just 19 hours, quickly surpassing the $50,000 goal.
The Maryland native had moved to San Diego and drove to the concert with boyfriend Austin Hughes, who was uninjured. According to The Baltimore Sun, the couple was separated after Frost was taken to a nearby hospital. Once he learned that she was in surgery, Hughes kept the family updated on her status until they were able to fly to Las Vegas.
“Please pray for our oldest, Tina Frost, who is halfway through a projected 2 hour operation, for a bullet shot to the head above her right eye in Las Vegas,” Rich Frost, the woman’s father, posted to Facebook early Monday. “Her boyfriend Austin who was with her at the concert, is safe and in the hospital waiting room, providing us with updates.
FULL COVERAGE OF MASSACRE ON THE STRIP
A follow up post on Tuesday said Frost’s vitals and responses were good, and that she had not developed a fever.
“When they have to move her, she sits up on her own, rolls herself and pushes the nurses away,” Rich wrote. “She calms down when we say ‘easy Tina.’ Her eye is swollen shut and she is on the ventilator and still in her coma, but it is encouraging.”
Another GoFundMe page set up on behalf of Jonathan Smith described his heroic actions before he was wounded while at the concert to celebrate his brother’s birthday.
“Jonathan was shot during the Las Vegas massacre while trying to secure the safety of others,” Tiffany Jones, the man’s sister-in-law, wrote on the GoFundMe. “He was there celebrating his brother’s 43rd birthday when shots were fired. According to witnesses, he helped save dozens of lives ushering people to safety before he too was shot and wounded.”
The page, which doubled its $7,000 goal within 17 hours, was updated to include that Smith had returned home and was recovering with his three children.
In addition to 520 wounded, 59 were killed in the most deadly shooting in modern U. S. history.",0
"According to new research the gap between Britain’srichest and poorest has significantly increased over the last decade, with the rich 64% richer and the poor 57% poorer than before.
According to new research the gap between Britain’srichest and poorest has significantly increased over the last decade, with the rich 64% richer and the poor 57% poorer than before.
Younger workers have fallen behind older people while homeowners – particularly those who have paid off their mortgages – have become increasingly affluent compared with their neighbours who are paying rent.
Evidence of Britain’s rapidly growing wealth gap was revealed by the Social Market Foundation (SMF), which analysed the changing incomes and savings of thousands of people. Its findings will be seized on by Labour as evidence that any recovery from the downturn is uneven and not shared across all income groups. However, the trends uncovered by the SMF began before the Coalition came to power, underlining the huge impact of the credit crunch on levels of affluence.
It found that the average wealth of the best-off one-fifth of families rose by 64 per cent between 2005 and 2012-13 as they put more money aside as a buffer against future shocks. They have average savings and investments of around 10,000 compared with 6,000 seven years earlier.
The proportion of people in this group with debts (apart from mortgages) dropped from 43 per cent to less than one-third. However, the SMF found the poorest 20 per cent are less financially secure than they were in 2005, with their net wealth falling by 57 per cent and levels of debt and use of overdrafts increasing.
Homeowners have raced ahead of people in rented accommodation, largely due to low-interest mortgage rates compared to higher renting costs. Homeowners who paid off their mortgages between 2005 and 2012 find themselves 2,500 better off. These gains are above and beyond the rise in property values over the period, the SMF said.
Meanwhile, the inter-generational gap in incomes and wealth has widened significantly. The wages of those aged 26 to 35 fell steeply and they are far less likely to be property owners, with the proportion in this age bracket who are buying a home falling from nearly three-quarters in 2005 to just over half in 2012-13.
On average, they have less than a week’s income in savings, owe 45 per cent more money than they did in 2005 and are increasingly running up overdrafts to pay their bills.
“There is a need to support those on the lower incomes and younger age groups to save more. But this will be challenging, especially for those with little income to spare once necessities have been paid for,” said the SMF report Wealth in the Downturn: Winners and Losers. “The process of repairing personal finances will most likely only begin once the expected growth in wages materialises.”
It said the declining financial health of younger workers and people on low incomes limited the economy’s ability to rely for growth on consumer spending among all income levels. And it warned that these groups are ill-prepared for future financial shocks or rises in interest rates.
Nida Broughton, the SMF’s chief economist and the report’s co-author, said: “Our findings show the wealth gap between rich and poor and young and old increased during the downturn. The economic uncertainty… prompted many to pay their debts and build up their savings. But the young and those on low incomes missed out.”",1
"The global ransomware cyberattack known as “WannaCry” has paralyzed computers running Britain’s hospital network, Germany’s national railway and other companies and government agencies worldwide in what may be the largest online extortion scheme ever.
Ransomware is software that infects a computer and then demands the user pay to have their information restored. ""WannaCry"" infected computers are frozen and display a big message in red informing users, “Oops, your files have been encrypted!” and demanding about $300 in online bitcoin payment. (Bitcoin in a type of digital currency widely used online.) Victims have only hours to pay the ransom, which rises to $600 before the files are destroyed.
Twitter users around the world posted complaints about their computers shutting down and posted photos of the ransom demands on their computer screens.
Money has been trickling in, according to a Twitter account monitoring bitcoin wallets linked to the attacks, with victims paying nearly $39,000 by Monday afternoon in Asia.
Cybersecurity experts say the worm affects computers using Microsoft operating systems and takes advantage of a vulnerability in the software to spread the infection. “WannaCry” is particularly malicious because it takes just one person to click on an infected link or email attachment to cause the virus to spread to other machines on the same network.
Eiichi Moriya, a cybersecurity expert and professor at Meiji University, noted that many payments already were being made, but warned that paying the ransom did not ensure any fix, and suggested people keep data backups as the attack causes
encryptions.
“You are dealing with a criminal,” he said. “It’s like after a robber enters your home. You can change the locks but what has happened cannot be undone. If someone kidnaps your child, you may pay your ransom but there is no guarantee your child will return.”

They sold their house in California to prepare for the cost of care and moved to Minnesota to live with one of Thorsen’s daughters. Davis planned their finances methodically; once Thorsen’s long-term care insurance ran out, the daunting $98,000 bill for her nursing home would be manageable — because they could deduct medical expenses from their tax bill. But as the Republican tax plan took shape, Davis felt as though the rug was being pulled out from under them. He plugged numbers into a spreadsheet as details of the plan emerged, finally arriving at the conclusion that after all his budgeting to avoid digging into savings, he would need to withdraw about $24,000 next year. “I kind of had everything all planned out. I had it planned out to where I really wasn’t spending any time worrying about the finances,” Davis said. “It’s kind of a kick in the stomach to have it all figured out and then to have it kind of all start falling apart.”  [Share your story: Will the Republican tax plan help or hurt your family?]  In their plan to cut taxes and declutter the tax code, Republicans have proposed repealing all but a small handful of tax breaks. But people rely on those tax breaks in budgeting for medical expenses, adopting children, replacing stolen or disaster-damaged property, and even paying for business expenses. These credits and deductions don’t feel like loopholes to the people who depend on them. Those tax breaks have shaped people’s financial lives in fundamental ways, providing relief from taxes on spending that isn’t optional. “As soon as they talked about eliminating these deductions, that’s when it caught my attention: Uh-oh, I’m in trouble now,” Davis said. “It’s going to throw out of whack all the projections I’ve made for what we’ll have available in 2018.”     House Republican leaders on Thursday, Nov. 2 proposed legislation that would overhaul the U. S. tax code. Here's what you need to know about it. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   The Republican tax plan aims to do away with itemization for most people by doubling the standard deduction to $24,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The plan preserves some of the most popular deductions — for mortgage interest, property taxes and charitable contributions — but it imposes new limits. For new home loans, interest payments can be deducted only for the first $500,000, and only up to $10,000 in property taxes can be deducted.  But the medical expense deduction, taken on about 8.8million tax returns in 2015, is one of the many being repealed. It isn’t the most common tax break — in part because it requires a person’s medical expenses to be greater than 10percent of their adjusted gross income. But for those who do take it, the deduction can be crucial. The most obvious scenarios include an older person with a pension who would otherwise owe tax, or a family that paysto care for an older parent in a nursing home. But it isn’t just older people, several tax specialists said. Eliminating the medical deduction could affect parents of children with special needs, who might use the tax break to deduct expenses not covered by insurance. Working-age people with a serious illness such as cancer might also use it in the face ofhigh out-of-pocket medical costs and earnings that are lower because they can’t work. “I just don’t see why these people should lose their deductions, just like that,” said Steven Kronzek, a certified public accountant based in the District. “It’s mostly elderly, it’s not wealthy people, and there’s no lobbyists running around to look out for these people.” Republicans have argued that their proposed revisions would make the tax code simpler and result in savings for families. “Our bill lowers the tax rates and increases the standard deduction so people can immediately keep more of their paychecks — instead of having to rely on a myriad of provisions that many will never use and others may use only once in their lifetime,” said House Ways and Means Committee spokeswoman Lauren Aronson. “This tax relief will give families the flexibility to use their paychecks for what’s most important to them — whether for home repairs, different medical expenses, or other unique expenses that come up at different stages of life.” Tax preparers are still reviewing the bill to see whether itcould have consequences for their clients. But Leon LaBrecque, chief executive of LJPR Financial Advisors in Michigan, said that given the current complicated system, simplifying the tax code might have a number of unintended consequences. “What I call the slightly disingenuous version is that everyone gets a tax cut. It’s way too complicated a system,” LaBrecque said. He listed off people who might be losing a valuable deduction: salespeople who deduct big unreimbursed business expenses, as well as police, firefighters and others who deduct union dues. In a year marked by major natural disasters such as hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and devastating wildfires in California, some tax preparers raised concerns about eliminating tax deductions for casualty losses, such as major property damage due to storms. “It definitely provides a huge benefit, particularly for those who are in our area who unfortunately did not have flood insurance,” said Jason Sanders, the tax department head at Briggs & Veselka, a certified public accounting firm in Houston. “If the bill were to pass as it stands now, the casualty loss deduction would be repealed and we would just have to rely on Congress to bring it back in the case of a disaster-type situation.”  [The country’s flood insurance program is sinking. Rescuing it won’t be easy.]  Congress recognized the importance of the tax break for disaster recovery after this year’s hurricanes, taking steps to waive limits on the casualty loss deduction. The tax bill would not interfere with that legislation, and Sanders said he was hopeful that Congress would act to reinstate the deduction in the case of future disasters, even if the tax plan passed. The plan also strikes the adoption tax credit, worth up to $13,570 per child in 2017, even though Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), the chief writer of the tax plan, is father to two adopted sons. The credit is used to help families with adoption expenses, which can include legal fees, court costs and travel. The credit was taken on nearly 64,000 returns in 2015, according to Internal Revenue Service data, and its removal could discourage adoptions,advocates warned. How or whether individuals will be affected by the loss of deductions will depend on their personal circumstances, but even provisions that may have a relatively modest effect on an individual’s tax bill could be significant in the message they send. “What is the biggest piece of growth in the individual debt? When you look at that pie, these days it’s student loan debt — more than atrillion dollars now. So, hey, congratulations, millennials!” said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. “The modest benefit you got from deducting that interest? That’s going away.” But those with very large medical expenses may be in the most difficult position of all, and it might lead to difficult choices — pushing some families to put parents on Medicaid rather than pay for the nursing home.
Diane Thorsen and Richard Davis, at Thorsen’s nursing home, are able to deduct facility costs as medical expenses under current tax law. (Jenn Ackerman for The Washington Post)  Davis knows there are families in worse situations; he and Thorsen are fortunate to have pensions, savings and family support. They met at work in Santa Cruz, Calif., nearly three decades ago. He worked as a supervisor at the data center, she as a computer programmer. They got to know each other playing beach volleyball and softball, and they loved being active, skiing at Lake Tahoe and playing with their dogs. But they knew what might loom in their future. Thorsen’s mother had an early-onset form of Alzheimer’s, and her father suffered from it later in life. They bought long-term care insurance when they were in their 40s. Anticipation doesn’t make the relentless disease any easier to cope with; it’s painful to see Thorsen, who enjoyed socializing with friends and going out dancing, slowly vanish. But Davis visits her often and says that some of the important pieces are still there, even if Thorsen can’t put them together. Once when he was sitting with her and had a book in her lap, he was surprised to realize she could still read. And she knows the names of family members, although he isn’t sure sheknows who they are when they visit. The disease is overwhelming on its own. To think about carefully laid financial plans crumbling — he anticipates his tax bill will jump by about $20,000 in a year — makes it harder. “It entails dipping into savings. There’s no getting around that,” Davis said. “If it ever got to a point where it becomes too unmanageable — where we would see the end of the road in our savings — there is an end to the road.”

"A breakthrough cancer therapy that can wipe out leukemia in some deathly ill children and young adults comes with an expensive, long-lasting side effect. The blood cancer treatment, called CAR-T, is made byNovartis AG and is on the brink of approval after a panel of advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration backed it Wednesday in a 10-0 vote. It’s highly effective: In a clinical trial of patients who’d mostly run out of treatment options, 83 percent of patients who took it saw their disease go into remission.Yet it also causes collateral damage. Novartis’s therapy commandeers the body’s immune system to destroy the cells where the blood cancer begins. Those cells, however, also make antibodies that fight off other diseases. Every patient whose cancer was wiped out in the study also contracted a condition called B-cell aplasia, which must be treated with drugs that can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year.
“The therapy is being given to people who would be dead if they didn’t receive it, and they would be dead within a pretty short period of time,” said Edmund Waller, director of Emory University’s stem cell and immune therapy division. The patients now have chronic immune system conditions, he said, “but they are happy to be alive.”Neither the cancer therapy nor the follow-up is cheap. CAR-T treatments under development by Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis and several other companies are expected to cost $500,000 or more, partly because they’re tailored for each patient, genetically manipulating their infection-fighting T-cells to destroy acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a form of blood cancer.To prop up the patient’s crippled immune system, an injection of immune-boosting immunoglobulin is needed every three to four weeks as long as the altered cells remain in the body, Novartis said in a statement. Those treatments can cost as much as $10,000 a dose, and may be needed for life.
Immunoglobulin is already a big business generating about $8 billion in sales a year for drugmakers including Shire Plc,CSL Ltd., and Grifols SA. The antibodies are spun out of donated blood, and infused into patients, whose risk of infection quickly returns to normal levels.Read More: Sophie’s Choice for Oncologists: Who Gets New Life-Saving Drug
Insurance companies said their decision to cover Novartis’s treatment and any follow-up therapy will be based on the clinical results of the drug.“While CAR-T is a promising new type of immunotherapy, it is not commercially available and we have yet to complete our evaluation,” said T.J. Crawford, a spokesman for Aetna Inc. “Coverage determination will be made on clinical grounds.”There is little dispute among experts over the therapy’s promise.“This is probably the most exciting thing I have seen in my lifetime,” said Tim Cripe, chief of hematology and oncology at Ohio State University’s Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Cripe was a member of the FDA advisory panel that voted Wednesday to support the drug’s approval.Panel members did raise questions about the long-term safety and potential complications, including infections and new cancers that could arise years after treatment. Novartis has pledged to track patients for 15 years for any safety issues.Novertis’s CAR-T would be used in patients age 25 and under whose cancer comes back after chemotherapy -- about 600 people a year in the U.S. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common cancer in children. About 85 percent are cured by chemotherapy, but those whose cancer returns have few options.Novartis shares fell 0.6 percent to 80 Swiss francs at 2:38 p.m. in Zurich.
The most important business stories of the day.
The complication doesn’t apply universally across all CAR-T products, and newer generations now in development appear able to avoid the permanent destruction of B cells. Kite Pharma Inc., which has already applied for FDA approval of its rival therapy to treat a more common cancer known as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, said it hasn’t been an issue. The company hasn’t disclosed how many patients in its trials needed immunoglobulin after treatment.Makers of immunoglobulin are reluctant to talk about the issue, since their products aren’t approved for patients who develop secondary immune deficiencies that are a complication of another medical condition or treatment. The production process is complex, and shortages can develop. That could create problems if demand surges because of Novartis’s cancer treatment.“It is not uncommon for the companies who make these products to manage supply closely,” said Elizabeth Kalina, a spokeswoman for Shire, which is building a new manufacturing facility that’s slated to open in Georgia in 2018. “Shire continues to explore ways to address patient demand today and as it looks toward the future.”Immunoglobulins like Gammagard, made by Shire’s subsidiary Baxalta, can cost $1,000 to $10,000 per injection, based on a patient’s weight.While the permanence of the manipulated cancer killers is good for eliminating the blood malignancy, it’s bad for the immune system.“Even if there was disease that pops up later, the CAR-T cell could still eliminate it. But the normal B cells are also being eliminated,” said Emory’s Waller. “It’s bad that it might be permanent.”Kite’s therapy also hurt the antibody-producing B cells, but they came back. The company said that in its clinical trials, it was able to detect CAR-T cells in patients who respond to therapy for as long as six months, with recovery of normal B cells taking from a few months to more than one year, said Christine Cassiano, a spokeswoman for the Santa Monica, California-based company. The recovery of B cells may occur in patients who continue to respond to therapy, even after their CAR-T cells have declined, she said.

"Tom Vilsack, who stepped down as agriculture secretary last week, will spend his next professional chapter as cheerleader in chief for U. S. dairy exporters.
The longest-serving member of Barack Obama’s cabinet is set to begin his new job as president and CEO of the U. S. Dairy Export Council on Feb. 1, Vilsack confirmed in an exclusive interview with POLITICO. It’s a high-profile hire aimed at boosting dairy sales abroad as many U.S. producers struggle to stay in business because of low prices stemming from a global market flooded with milk.
“There are tremendous opportunities,” Vilsack said, pointing to Mexico, Central America, Asia and North Africa as prime markets for expansion.
“It’s a tough industry, but we’ve seen a remarkable growth in exports over the years,” he said.
When the U. S. Dairy Export Council launched in 1995, dairy exports accounted for roughly 5 percent of the U.S. dairy industry's production. Since then, that percentage has nearly tripled to 15 percent, the result of a sustained, global promotion effort. In 2016, dairy exports were up as a percentage of volume, but their overall value dropped to an estimated $4.7 billion, down from a high of almost $6.8 billion in 2014.
“There are some who don’t see why we can’t get to 17 to 20 percent,” Vilsack said, when asked about whether there’s a goal, in terms of percentage of production.
“It’s a tough market,” he said. “Our producers continue to be efficient and continue to figure out ways to produce more and do it in a sustainable way.”
Vilsack is taking over the reins at USDEC from Tom Suber, who retired last year after leading the organization since it was first established by Dairy Management Inc., the industry’s checkoff program. The checkoff has funded campaigns like “Got Milk?” to encourage consumption of dairy products, along with other research and market development programs over the years.
Dairy producers and importers pay 15 and 7.5 cents, respectively, for every hundred pounds of milk they sell into a generic fund aimed at promoting dairy products, raising more than $140 million annually for the dairy checkoff program, about $20 million of which is used to support the USDEC’s activities and employee salaries. Most of the executives listed on financial disclosures pull mid to high six-figures in annual compensation.
Vilsack is seen as a “ready-made expert” on boosting sales of U. S. farm products abroad given his track record as agriculture secretary, said Tom Gallagher, Dairy Management Inc.'s CEO.
“I don’t think there’s been anybody in agriculture that is more passionate about standing up for U. S. farmers and ranchers,” Gallagher said. “And I think he can continue his experience as an executive in this new role.”
Having such a tireless advocate for U. S. farmers and rural America also is “an emotional shot in the arm” for many industry leaders, who are feeling hopeful that Vilsack can help turn around the slumping dairy economy, Gallagher added. Many U.S. dairy farmers are barely breaking even now that milk prices have dropped nearly 40 percent over the last two years due to overproduction in the United States and European Union and slowing demand from China.
But the hire is not without its critics. After Agri-Pulse reported earlier this month that Vilsack was likely headed to USDEC, Tom Philpott at Mother Jones wrote that the move would “represent quite a swish through the revolving door separating government agencies and the industries they regulate.”
With the move, Vilsack is undoubtedly getting a huge pay bump — something that’s common for outgoing cabinet officials. Vilsack was making roughly $205,000 leading USDA. According to the most recent tax filing available, Suber’s base compensation in 2014 was $355,000, but with bonus and everything else factored in, his compensation totaled just over $875,000.
When asked about the revolving door criticism, Vilsack pointed to the ethics restrictions in place and said he intends to follow them “to the letter.” It's unlawful for commodity checkoffs to fund lobbying efforts aimed at influencing legislation or administrative activities.
“I think it’s important for people to understand the very severe ethical restrictions that are placed on a retiring secretary of agriculture,” Vilsack said, explaining that he cannot have direct contact with any USDA officials. “No one,"" he said. “The only one I can contact is the ethics officer.”
“There’s a very bright line that’s drawn in terms of access and approach and communication with people at USDA, and I think that’s important for folks to know,” he added. “There’s also a fairly restrictive approach in terms of federal agencies in the exec branch of government. I think if people understood that they’d be less concerned.”
In his new gig, Vilsack is expected to spend the first several months traveling around the country to hear from dairy farmers and USDEC members, gathering input to help formulate a vision for the next five to seven years.
Over the long term, the focus will be on tackling trade barriers, opening up new markets, and spurring demand, while also promoting efficiency and sustainability advancements domestically, Vilsack said.
The former agriculture secretary is taking the helm at an uncertain time for free trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership promised to expand market access for U. S. dairy products in countries like Japan, Vietnam and Malaysia. But President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to withdraw the U.S. from the TPP and has yet to lay out a specific agenda for international trade.
“We really don’t know what the policies are going to be and we really won’t know for a while,” Vilsack said, adding that the political appointees by the incoming administration will be key for deciphering the policy direction.
In addition to promoting demand, there are also serious trade barriers that must be tackled, whether they’re sanitary and phytosanitary issues or geographical indications, Vilsack added.
“These are threats to the industry that have to be dealt with,” he said.
In interviews, both Vilsack and Gallagher named a long list of countries and regions that are considered top priorities, including some of the 12 involved in the TPP.
“You have to go where the people are,” Vilsack said, pointing to China, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. “I think there are opportunities in Africa that will no doubt expand over time. And there’s no reason why we can’t be competitive in Latin America.”
In the context of global trade, Vilsack said he views his future work as having an impact far beyond dairy.
“I think my focus is primarily on how we export the American brand,” Vilsack recently told POLITICO. “It’s a chance for us to not only sell more milk and dairy products, but it’s also a chance for us to emphasize the American brand of quality and innovation.”",0
"From how to charge them to whether they are really better for the environment
From how to charge them to whether they are really better for the environment
The first generation of electric-car buyers have been people with homes where it is easy to plug one in. “The vast majority of Nissan Leaf customers are [families with] 2.4 children, mums and dads, with off-street parking,” said Gareth Dunsmore of Nissan Europe. “Tomorrow that won’t be the case.”
Dunsmore envisages charging points becoming ubiquitous at workplaces, and at shopping centres, railway stations, hotels and cinemas. For longer journeys, rapid chargers that can recharge a car’s battery in 30 minutes will increasingly proliferate across motorway service stations and at conventional refuelling stations.
For drivers living on terraced streets, the answers are not so simple but solutions are beginning to emerge. For example, Kensington and Chelsea council is running a trial with a UK energy company and German firm to add charging sockets to street lamps.
Most mass market electric cars today have a range of 100-150 miles before the battery runs flat. Some of the top-end cars, such as Tesla’s electric sports cars, can run for 334 miles before needing a plug socket.
While that may not sound much compared to the 400-500 miles or more that a petrol or diesel car can manage before refilling, most car journeys in the UK would easily be accomplished in an electric car. Half of journeys are one to five miles; 38% are for five to 25 miles and only 2% are for 50 miles and more.
Of course, some people will need to go much further – and that’s where plug-in hybrids come in, using a petrol engine to run an electric motor after the battery runs out.
Improving battery technology is expected to extend even pure electric cars’ ranges to about 400 miles within a decade.
Londoners in an electric car can already enter the congestion charge zone for free. If the government’s anti-pollution drive leads to more towns and cities imposing an air quality zone, that could lead to more tolls, from which electric cars are likely to be exempt.
In terms of upfront costs, electric cars are still clearly more expensive than conventional ones – but companies like Renault and Nissan are getting around that with deals where buyers lease the battery. For example, the UK’s best-selling electric, the Nissan Leaf, is 16,680 with the battery on lease for a monthly fee, rising to 21,680 if you buy the battery outright.
Electricity is certainly cheaper than petrol or diesel. Travelling 100 miles in an electric car will cost 3-4 depending on energy tariffs, compared with 15 in a petrol car.
Affordability is a key issue. When Volvo announced all its new car launches would by electric or hybrid from 2019, it stressed that they would be premium models, ie expensive.
Jack Cousens of the AA said: “Buying a car is an important financial decision, and families on low incomes will need government assistance and incentives to make the change to electric vehicles.”
Makers of electric cars sell their models with a warranty for the battery, which will lose capacity over time. In the case of the Nissan Leaf, it’s covered for five years or 60,000 miles, rising to eight years or 100,000 miles for the version with a bigger battery. But yes, eventually you will need to either buy a new battery – by which time their cost should have fallen – or sell the car on.
Electric cars have been around long enough in the UK for a second-hand battery market to be emerging. One energy company, Eaton, is already selling used electric batteries for reuse as household batteries.
Probably, yes. One car-buying website says bad headlines for diesels, which on average sell for 7,000 used, are causing prices to fall faster in value than before. Motorway.co.uk predicts that over the next year the average price of used diesel cars could fall as much as 15% compared to their current depreciation rate.
There are 8,476 filling stations across the UK. Energy analysts Wood Mackenzie say they are closing at a rate of about 100 a year and, with the rise of an electrified fleet, there will probably be no more than 6,000 sites by 2035. Numbers will probably continue to fall, although some may be converted to fast-charging sites
Yes, even with fossil fuels in the power mix. In the UK, 50% of power is now generated from low carbon sources, and with that share growing rapidly in the next decade, emissions from electric cars will fall too.
Analysts are expecting a 100-fold increase in the production of lithium, the key material in electric cars’ batteries. Much of that will come from South America, particularly Chile and Bolivia, which claims to have 70% of the world’s lithium reserves. China and Australia also provide lithium.",0
"Student loans have grown to become the second-largest source of consumer debt in the U. S. behind only home mortgages, surpassing credit card debt since the financial crisis.
And there is little relief in sight. Grads must repay loans even if they drop out of college or can't find a job. That could leave 2014's graduating class, which the Wall Street Journal called ""the most indebted ever,"" wondering whether the education was worth the average $33,000 in loans they took home with their diplomas.
What to do about that financial albatross?
There are income-based repayment plans—which President Obama has been pushing in an effort to lessen the debt load as wages continue to stagnate and job opportunities remain scarce—and deferment is an option if you lose your job or experience another kind of financial hardship. Refinancing student loans may also lower your payments. But most student-loan holders have to pay the piper eventually—except for those who may qualify for true student loan forgiveness.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau revealed last year that many of the estimated 25 percent of the U. S. workforce employed by a public service employer ""may be eligible for existing student loan repayment benefits.""
It pays to understand the circumstances that might lead to your loans being classified by the federal government as eligible for being forgiven, canceled or discharged.
The most important thing to know is this: Student loan forgiveness programs cover many types of federal student loans—including Direct Loans, Perkins Loans and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans, such as the Stafford loans—but there is no dedicated student loan forgiveness program for private student loans. In addition, the forgiveness programs vary depending on the type of federal loan—some apply only to Direct loans and others only to Perkins loans, for example.
The U. S. Department of Education provides a reference chart covering all of the conditions that may lead to cancellation of a loan and covering all the types of federal loans, as well as links to the applications that must be completed.
Here are the basics:
For the Direct Loan, FFEL program and Perkins loans, the following conditions can result in 100 percent student loan forgiveness:
* Total or permanent disability or death (also referred to as discharge rather than forgiveness).
* Bankruptcy (though only in rare cases).
The most certain way to qualify for student loan forgiveness is to work as a teacher, in the public service sector or for a nonprofit organization.
If you are a full-time teacher for five consecutive years in a designated elementary or secondary school or educational service agency serving students from low-income families, you can qualify for up to $5,000 (up to $17,500 for elementary/secondary special education teachers and secondary math and science teachers) of the total loan amount outstanding after completion of the fifth year of teaching.
Though note that graduate students and parents of students who hold PLUS Loans do not qualify. Loans with balances taken out prior to October 1998 are not eligible, and your five years of consecutive teaching must have commenced after October 1998.
The teacher loan-forgiveness application is available here.
For Perkins loans holders, cancellation of up to 100 percent of a loan may be granted if you have served full-time in a public or nonprofit elementary or secondary school system as a teacher in a school serving students from low-income families; or are a special education teacher, including teachers of infants, toddlers, children, or youth with disabilities; or a teacher in the fields of mathematics, science, foreign languages or bilingual education, or in any other field of expertise determined by a state education agency to have a shortage of qualified teachers in that state. The following formula applies to the cancellation scheduled:
* 15 percent canceled per year for the first and second years of service.
* 20 percent canceled for the third and fourth years.
* 30 percent canceled for the fifth year.
For public-service employees generally, the main loan program considered for forgiveness is the Direct Loans. Perkins or FFEL loan holders who work in the public sector and want to qualify would need to consolidate their loans in the Direct Loans program first. PLUS loans for parents and graduate students and/or professional students are part of the Direct Loans program.
Full-time employment with a federal, state or local government agency, entity or organization, or a not-for-profit organization that has been designated as tax-exempt by the Internal Revenue Service, may qualify you for this program. A private not-for-profit employer that is not a tax-exempt organization can also qualify if they serve the public interest and have no affiliate with labor unions or partisan politics.
The basic factors to qualify are:
* Making 120 on-time, full, scheduled, monthly payments on your Direct Loans. Only payments made after October 1, 2007, qualify. (Perkins or FFEL loan holders who consolidate into the Direct loan program must start the 120-payment cycle once the loans are consolidated.)
* When you make each of those payments, you must be working full-time at a qualifying public-service organization.
You must complete the employer certification form and send it to the federal loan servicing agency. The first forgiveness-of-loan balances as of October 1, 2007, will not be granted until October 2017.
For Perkins loan holders, a chart of the specific public service sector positions that qualify for cancellation—and to what percentage of total loan balance—is available from the Department of Education.
The authoritative source for all information related to federal student loan forgiveness programs and the criteria considered in applications is the U. S. Department of Education's web site section devoted to the details.
Applying for student loan forgiveness does not mean it will be granted, and it pays to be very careful in completing the necessary forms.
A negative decision on student loan forgiveness cannot be appealed, except for in the cases of false certification and forged signature discharges, for which the U. S. Department of Education may review the case.
If the basis for a request for loan forgiveness was a school closing before a student could compete his degree, other options if it is rejected include:
* Contacting the state licensing agency to see if there is a tuition recovery fund or performance bond that will cover damages based on the school closure.
* Claiming a loss in a bankruptcy proceeding if the school filed bankruptcy.
Students can also consult the federal rating on higher-education institutions' financial strength when deciding where to attend school. It is not a guarantee of financial stability or that a school will go bankrupt, either, but it is a resource to consult in analyzing an institution's financial situation before taking out loans to attend it.",0
"ETHIOPIA'S flagship social-housing programme is probably the most ambitious in Africa. But for most locals the houses are still barely affordable. The poor cannot afford the down payment for even the most subsidised units. And those who can often struggle to meet repayments, opting instead to rent out the houses and move elsewhere. In this respect, though, Ethiopia is hardly alone in Africa. Take Angola, where a recent $3.5bn social-housing project on the outskirts of Luanda, the capital, offered apartments from $84,000, in a country where incomes per person are just over $4,000. Or Cameroon, where the government’s social-housing scheme is out of reach to 80% of the population, according to the World Bank. In Ethiopia the state has spent over a decade building cheap homes on an almost unprecedented scale, but supply still fails to match demand. Why?
High costs and expanding populations mostly put an end to the kind of government housing provision that was common in much of Africa during the early post-colonial years. With its state provision, Ethiopia is an outlier. The majority of countries rely instead on a subsidised private sector to deliver cheap homes. But across the continent governments and builders are hobbled by the wider construction industry. This is often underdeveloped and uncompetitive, constrained by poor infrastructure and a lack of both skilled labour and cheap materials. Cement in Africa is typically around three times the world price. Construction can be painfully slow. The largest house-building firm in Ghana claims to have finished a mere 3,500 units in the past decade.
Inappropriate regulations drive up costs further. Local materials are often prohibited in favour of more expensive imports. In some countries strict minimum-lot sizes—many dating back to the pre-independence era, when urban populations were smaller and the average inhabitant wealthier—price all but the richest out of the formal market. Most urban Africans simply build for themselves, which means the vast majority languish in informal slums. In Malawi, the least expensive formal house is almost 60 times more expensive than the typical informal alternative.
Look more closely, though, and the problem is a more fundamental one: land. Urban land markets in Africa are thin—only 10% of the continent’s land is registered and marketable—and prices are often wildly inflated. For example, in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, a 99-year lease in the commercial centre can now cost as much as $15,000 per square metre. Private developers thus cater almost exclusively to the rich. So do banks. The lack of secure and enforceable land rights crimps the market for cheap housing finance, hurting both firms and households. “Affordable” mortgages in Africa typically have interest rates of more than 20%, which puts formal housing even further out of reach for the average city-dweller.",0

"UNITED NATIONS — More than 13 million people inside Syria still need humanitarian assistance and nearly half are in ""acute need"" as a result of having fled their homes, of hostilities, and of limited access to food, health care and other basic needs, the U. N. humanitarian chief said Monday.
Mark Lowcock told the Security Council the number of Syrians who have been displaced within the country for a long time has dropped from 6.3 million to 6.1 million. But he said ""levels of new displacement remain high,"" with 1.8 million people reportedly forced to leave between January and September.
Since just the offensive began in November 2016 that ousted the Islamic State extremist group from the city of Raqqa, its self-proclaimed capital, airstrikes and clashes resulted in over 436,000 people being displaced to 60 different locations, Lowcock said, speaking via video conference from Amman, Jordan.
In the eastern province of Deir el-Zour, he said, heavy fighting and airstrikes continue to cause civilian deaths and injuries as well as large-scale displacement. The International Organization for Migration reported some 350,000 people forced to flee since August, including more than 250,000 in October, he said.
Lowcock said airstrikes on the city of Al Mayadin in Deir el-Zour in mid-October left hospitals and medical facilities ""inoperable,"" depriving about 15,000 people of health care. He said the U. N. children's agency UNICEF and the World Health Organization reported that the attacks destroyed a cold room where at least 140,000 doses of U.N. provided measles and polio vaccines were destroyed.
""This is a particular setback for efforts to check one of the world's largest polio outbreaks in recent memory, an outbreak which continues to plague Deir el-Zour in particular, with new cases continuing to be reported,"" Lowcock said.
He said nearly 3 million people continue to live in besieged and hard-to-reach areas where the U. N. faces ""considerable challenges"" in meeting humanitarian needs.
Lowcock said there was an expectation that progress in de-escalating fighting would result in increased humanitarian access but ""this has yet to materialize.""
On average, he said, only 10 percent of people in besieged locations were reached with U. N. assistance every month this year.
In the eastern Ghouta suburbs of Damascus, ""one of the four de-escalated areas where nearly 95 percent of Syria's besieged population lives,"" shelling has been reported in recent weeks and humanitarian access has been severely curtailed for months, Lowcock said.
""Since the start of the year, 110,000 people have received food assistance, out of an estimated population of nearly 400,000,"" he said. ""Today, the U. N. and partners delivered food, nutrition and health assistance to 40,000 people.""
Lowcock said ""an alarming number of child malnutrition cases"" have been reported in eastern Ghouta and more than 400 people with health problems need medical evacuation.
Britain's U. N. ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, called the situation in eastern Ghouta ""atrocious,"" saying de-escalation should not mean bombardment.
""What we fear is that the de-escalation zone is becoming a starvation zone,"" Rycroft said. ""So we call on the Syrian regime and their allies to lift the blockade to allow humanitarian aid to get through.""",0
"Another new trial of an Ebola vaccine has started, this time in Baltimore. It’s part of a flurry of efforts to kick-start stalled Ebola vaccine trials in the hope of using some soon to fight the exploding epidemic in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
The University of Maryland school of medicine is running the trial, which uses the same GlaxoSmithKline vaccine that the university is helping to test in Mali. The vaccine, which uses a common cold virus genetically engineered with a tiny piece of Ebola virus, is also being tested in Britain and Switzerland.
So far, 20 people have been vaccinated in the latest trial. First results could be back within a month or two. “The study will provide important results about the safety of the different doses and their ability to stimulate immune responses,” the school said in a statement.
“This is a key step in the accelerated Ebola vaccine testing process,” said Dr. Myron Levine, who’s helping lead the efforts. The vaccine was developed at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.
Ebola’s spread continues to worsen across Sierra Leone and Guinea, and it’s still raging in Liberia also. Worse, health officials fear an outbreak may be under way in Mali, with five out of six confirmed cases there fatal and hundreds of people exposed. So far, Ebola has infected more than 15,000 people and killed at least 5,000 of them.",0
"(Natural News) On March 11, 2011, terror struck northeastern Japan in the form of a massive magnitude-9 earthquake, which in turn unleashed a devastating tsunami that wiped out virtually everything in the city of Sukuiso. The effects of the earthquake were felt around the entire world, and even years later, the people of Japan were still finding debris washing up on shore. According to the Japanese government, the total damage caused by the earthquake cost the country an astonishing 25 trillion yen, the equivalent of roughly 300 billion U. S. dollars.
A few years later, it was discovered that radioactive water was being leaked from theFukushima power plant, which experienced a level 7 nuclear meltdown following the tsunami. According to Japan’s Reconstruction Agency, as of 2015, 230,000 people whose homes were destroyed in 2011 were still living in temporary housing. Also as of 2015, according to Japan’s National Police Agency, a total of 15,891 people were confirmed dead.
But perhaps one of the most devastating long-term consequences of the earthquake and the tsunami that followed was, and continues to be, the cooling system failure at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. Even two years after the event, the Tokyo Electric Power Company admitted that an astonishing 300 tons of radioactive water was flowing into the Pacific Ocean every single day. “Fukushima was created by the tsunami. The earthquake was not a factor,” explained Vasily Titov, director of the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration’s Center for Tsunami Research, based in Seattle, Washington. “Fukushima was designed for a tsunami smaller than the one we saw.” (RELATED:Read about the brutally honest way this nuclear engineer describes Fukushima).
Incredibly, small amounts of radioactive chemicals have even been discovered along the western coasts of the United States and Canada. In 2014 and 2015, trace amounts of Cesium-134 and Cesium-137 were collected from the ocean.
But even after all of this, Japan’s problems may still be far from over. Neil Hyatt, a professor of nuclear materials chemistry, claims that the cleanup process at Fukushima could take generations. “Somewhere between 40 and 100 years for the Fukushima cleanup and complete decommissioning is probably a reasonable estimate,” he predicts during an interview withTRT World, a government funded public broadcaster of Turkey. Hyatt goes on to say, “So right now work is proceeding to target and to plan, and they have an ambitious goal to retrieve some of the core material by 2020. They have a lot of different approaches to doing that.”(RELATED:Read about the unimaginable levels of radiation detected at Fukushima)
“One concern is there could be a resumption of the nuclear chain reaction and there are systems in place that would allow us to detect that,” Professor Hyatt added.
While the threat of a nuclear chain reaction is certainly legitimate, Tokyo Electric is still working tirelessly to reach the cores of the nuclear reactors. The problem they are having, however, is getting past a lethal wave of radiation that has the ability to kill a human in less than one minute. In order to get around this, Tokyo Electric pumps 400 tons of water nonstop each day through the reactors in order to cool melted fuel that is too radioactive to move. The water passes through into storage tanks, which Tokyo Electric has to continuously build as the amount of stored water accumulates. Currently, a total of 1,000 tanks hold a total of 920,000 tons of contaminated water. A new problem may soon be appearing over the horizon, however, as the workers are quickly running out of room to build new storage tanks.
It’s clear that the Japanese certainly have their hands full, and it is unfortunate that they may be forced to continue the cleanup process over the course of the next century. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of them. Stay informed aboutradiation effects at Radiation.news.",1
"BMW says it will make electric version of Mini car in U. K.
Amazon announces it will boost size of its new London office
Follow @Brexit for all the latest news, and sign up to our daily Brexit Bulletin newsletter.BMW AG and Amazon.com Inc. gave a vote of confidence in the U.K. economy, in contrast to banks and other businesses increasingly preparing to shift some operations to the European Union as Brexit nears.BMW said on Tuesday it will build an electric version of the iconic Mini compact car in Britain, hours after Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, announced it will expand the size of its new London headquarters.
The decisions will be welcomed by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government after a series of banks and businesses activated plans to protect themselves against possible fallout from Britain’s leaving of the EU, its biggest market.
The most important business stories of the day.
This month alone, Deutsche Bank AG said it will shift staff and money to Frankfurt, while EasyJet Plc revealed it will create a new airline based in Vienna to shield its routes within the EU. The Confederation of British Industry said on Monday that members are growing concerned about the risk that the U.K. will fail to secure a trade deal with the EU, resulting in tariffs and regulations being slapped on firms.BMW chose the U.K. over plants in Germany and the Netherlands to manufacture the battery-powered Mini even though a failure by May to strike a long-term trade accord with the EU could inflict tariffs on imported components.But the carmaker couldn’t delay a decision until March 2019, when Britain is set to leave the EU, and assigning the model to Mini’s main plant in Oxford, England, will likely ease tensions with U.K. officials keen for the marquee project.The company has owned the British nameplate for about two decades and since 2000 has invested about 1.75 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in its U.K. manufacturing operations. Including the Rolls-Royce marque, BMW employs about 18,000 people across the U.K. and exports 2.4 billion pounds of vehicles and parts from the country annually.

The additional space will house 450 new research and development recruits for its on-demand movie service.“The U.K. is a fantastic place to find talent and we feel good about building a global R&D center here,"" Doug Gurr, head of Amazon’s U.K. business, said at the opening of the site. “We’re very confident we’ll be able to recruit everyone we need.""Amazon joins a list of large U.S. tech firms, including Snap Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google, in doubling down on London expansion plans despite Brexit.London office vacancies climbed to 5.8 percent at the end of the first quarter from 3.9 percent a year earlier, the biggest increase since 2009, according to Deloitte LLP.The U.K. is among Amazon’s largest international markets with more than 22,000 full-time staff based in the country. Amazon plans to have at least 24,000 by the end of the year, double the number it had at the end of 2015.

To Protect Rhinos, This National Park Just Shoots People (50 Poachers Killed So Far)
Kaziranga National Park is a story of success when it comes to conservation of rhinos – but what they’ve done to achieve it is allowing its workers to shoot and even kill potential poachers. So far, the park has killed 50 people.
Rhinos are safe there – a century ago, there was only a handful of Indian one-horned rhinoceros. Now, the park hosts more than 2,400, which is two-thirds of the world’s population. However, little is talked about the fact that in 2015, more people were shot dead by park guards then the number of rhinos killed by poachers.
These people all went after rhino horn, as they could be sold for as much as $6,000 for 100g and are considerably more expensive than gold. They are mostly marketed as a miracle cure for everything from cancer to erectile dysfunction.
So yes, rhinos do need protection, but this has gone too far. National park’s workers can kill a person and get away with impunity. The question is, could this kind of punishment ever be justified? And how many innocent people were killed?

"Monarch Butterflies Rapidly Disappearing from Western North America – More Than the East
Something is causing monarch butterflies to disappear at a dramatically higherrate in Western North Americathan in the Eastern regions of the U. S.
In the early 1990s, people in the Coastal areas of California noticed a disconcerting decline of the monarch. It turns out they were correct. While scientists have focused on the problems of butterflies in the Eastern region, a new study uses citizen science monitoring over the decades to see a dramatic decline at Western clusters.
Cheryl Schultz, an associate professor at Washington State University Vancouver and lead author ofa new study, said:
Western monarchs are faring worse than their eastern counterparts…
In the 1980s, 10 million monarchs spent the winter in coastal California. Today there are barely 300,000.
And it’s not just that there are fewer monarch butterflies then there were decades ago…
[The study] also tells us that, if things stay the same, western monarchs probably won’t be around as we know them in another 35 years.
What Schultzis emphasizing is that if something isn’t done right now to stop the decline, butterflies as we know them won’t be around for our children.Current trends indicate an extinction risk of 72% in 20years and 86% in 50years, according to their analysis.
Emma Pelton, endangered species conservation biologist at the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation and co-author of the study, said:
Scientists, policy makers and the public have been focused on the dramatic declines in the well-known eastern population, yet this study reveals that western monarchs are even more at risk of extinction.
We will need significant conservation action to save monarch butterflies in the West.
Like eastern monarchs, which overwinter in Mexico, western monarchs have a spectacular migration. They overwinter in forested groves along coastal California, then fan out in the spring to lay their eggs on milkweed and drink nectar from flowers in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Utah. They return to their coastal overwintering sites in the fall.
What has disrupted this part of their life cycle?
Since the trend started three decades ago, the scientists surmise that the modification of habitat and increasing pesticide use are likely culprits. Even the USDA scrutinizes pesticides for killing off butterfly populations. It wouldn’t be a true environmental study without also pointing fingers at climate change. However, they admit that we don’t really know what’s going on.
The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which funded the study, is now considering whether to list the monarch butterfly as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.
See:Iowa City Carves 1000 Acres To Seed Habitat Rescue For Bees And Butterflies
The research concludes that to get populations back up, “managers could target historic abundance and high enough growth rates to avoid near-term extinction.”
With hope, there will be souls out there to help replenish populations or else will we have to contend withRobo Butterflies, too?

CREDIT WHERE IT’S DUE: House Republicans said they would pass a tax bill by Thanksgiving — and not only does that look like it’s going to happen, it looks like it might happen without a lot of drama.
That’s quite the contrast from the House GOP’s efforts on health care, in which Republicans pushed a bill across the finish line on the second try, and speaks to the GOP’s belief that enacting a tax cut is a must-do ahead of the 2018 elections. “There was little arm-twisting over the weekend, multiple sources close to leadership told POLITICO. And unlike with the Obamacare repeal effort earlier this year, when leaders made final-hour tweaks to win over resistant members, Speaker Paul Ryan’s team doesn’t intend to make significant changes to the legislation before the vote this time,” Rachael Bade writes.
To Rep. Pete King (R-N. Y.), that’s a sign that GOP leaders think they have 218 votes all but lined up. But that doesn’t mean this week will be drama-free. Rep. Darrell Issa’s defection last week could inspire other California Republicans to follow suit. And don’t forget, even if the House does pass a bill this week, it appears at the very least there’s still quite a debate over the state and local tax deduction.
ON TO THE SENATE: The Senate Finance Committee starts considering its tax bill this afternoon, and it’s fair to say the chamber’s tax writers are in for some long days. The Finance Committee’s website lists more than 350 potential amendments for this week’s markup — including the first and most important of all, the as-yet-unreleased changes that would allow the Senate tax bill to meet budget rules that require that a reconciliation measure not add to deficits outside the 10-year budget window. Other interesting items that could be up for discussion: proposals to force more retirement contributions into Roth-style accounts, and to ease the double taxation of corporate income — a pet project of Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). Democrats are proposing to claw back some of the bill’s benefits for the wealthy, in keeping with a broader point that Republicans couldn’t find a way to give tax relief to everyone even while working with $1.5 trillion.
Republicans only have a 14-12 advantage on the Finance Committee, and Democrats are expected to be fairly united against the GOP tax bill. So it remains an open question how much this pile of amendments — many of which would need offsets — will complicate matters for Hatch and GOP leaders.
How the bill stands now: The Senate bill is on average a tax cut for every income group for the next decade, the Joint Committee on Taxation found. And the Senate plan appears to best the House proposals when it comes to offering more permanent assistance to the middle class, as Pro Tax’s Brian Faler notes. But if you drill down a little more, JCT also found that close to one in 10 taxpayers would see tax hike of at least $100 in 2019. Almost 15 percent of returns with between $75,000 and $100,000 in income would get a tax increase, though the biggest loser would be the group making between $200,000 and $500,000 a year. Almost a quarter of them would see a tax hike.
Just over 30 percent of taxpayers — including virtually all making under $10,000 a year, and the majority of those making between $10,000 and $30,000 — would see basically no change in their taxes. And the rest — around 60 percent — would see a tax cut of at least $100, with the group making between a half-million and $1 million a year the most likely to benefit.
The findings came as both House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) walked back comments suggesting that everyone would get a tax cut under the GOP plans.
SURVIVE AND ADVANCE: Make no mistake — the momentum on taxes in both the House and the Senate is real. But the potential for a spat between the two chambers over the state and local deduction is pretty genuine, too.
House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) insisted on “Fox News Sunday” that the House wouldn’t accept a full repeal of the deduction, after objections from GOP lawmakers from New Jersey and New York led to the House keeping a local property tax deduction of up to $10,000. There’s still a ways to go until the House and Senate would be trying to hash out a final bill. But it’s also hard to overstate just how central full repeal of the state and local deduction is to the Senate plan, given that it accounts for 99 percent of its reductions of deductions and exclusions.
Also of note: House Republicans like Mark Meadows (R-N. C.), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, aren’t keen on the Senate’s one-year delay in cutting the corporate rate to 20 percent.

HEY, REMEMBER DYNAMIC SCORING? Republicans changed congressional budget rules three years ago to give themselves broader latitude to count economic growth from tax changes, as part of their preparation for tax reform. And now when the time comes, as Brian reports, it turns out dynamic scoring hasn’t been that easy to use. Part of the reason is the speed with which the GOP is moving, to try to keep the opposition at bay, and there’s also parliamentary questions and tax writers’ habit of changing the bill up until the last minute. But keep in mind: The reason Republicans allowed themselves $1.5 trillion in tax cuts is that’s the amount of growth they say would be spurred by overhauling the system.
AND YET … : Lots of analyses project that the GOP plans would in fact fall short of making up $1.5 trillion, The New York Times’ Jim Tankersley reports. “The disconnect is prompting House and Senate Republican leaders and the Trump administration to hunt down — and promote — more optimistic forecasts, even if they exclude large parts of the tax bills from their analyses or assume growth-boosting features that are not, in fact, in the bills.”
The Penn Wharton Budget Model, for instance, found that the latest House GOP bill would reduce revenues by as much as $1.7 trillion over a decade even after including the measure’s impact on growth.

SOME MORE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS … : Daniel Shaviro of the New York University Law School says there could be unintended consequences if Congress waits a year to cut the corporate tax rate but immediately allows for full expensing of business investments — as the Senate currently proposes. “This combination of timing approaches strongly encourages taxpayers to make negative-value (on a pretax basis) investments, such as expensing $100 in 2018 when the rate is 35%, in order to earn $90 in 2019 when the tax rate is 20%, thereby converting a $10 pretax loss into a $7 after-tax gain,” Shaviro writes.
And: Rebecca Kysar of Brooklyn Law School has some questions about the Senate’s 12.5 percent minimum tax on foreign intangible income — which she says very well might be a violation of World Trade Organization rules. This special rate for domestic intellectual property was put in to induce companies to keep their intellectual property in the U. S., but it also represents yet another chapter in the U.S.’s longstanding attempts to subsidize exports in violation of WTO rules.
MORE FROM THE CAVALRY: The American Action Network’s Middle-Class Growth Initiative is out with another advertisement supporting the GOP’s efforts at tax reform, this time with a $1.5 million campaign aimed at those high-tax places where the state and local deduction is most prized — California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The campaign will hit around two dozen GOP districts — including Issa’s.

"Often referred to as the City of the Dead, the village of Dargavs is considered to be one of the more mysterious sites in Russia. Hidden away in one of the five mountain ridges somewhere in the Caucasus mountains, the “city” is actually an ancient necropolis full of tombs or crypts. The people who lived here, buried their loved ones in this site for reasons that have been lost in the passage of time.
Many myths and legends surround the site and in the past local people refused to go here out of fear that they would not come out alive. Some sources say the oldest crypts dates back to the 16th century and were made due to a plague that swept through the area decimating the population.
Dargavs is located in the republic of North Ossetia in southern Russia. A three hour drive through dangerous and winding roads, the site sits on the slope of a hill overlooking the Fiagdon River. It lies in the middle of a mountain valley which stretches over 17 kilometers (10. 6 miles) with 4,000 meter (13,000 feet) peaks looming above the village.
Mountain looming over Dargavs: The City of the Dead (Wikimedia Commons)
The first mention of the site dates back to the beginning of the 14th Century AD, when the ancestors of the modern day Ossetians settled down on the mountain ridge. Since the land was so expensive, it is said they were forced to choose the windiest and most unserviceable place imaginable. However, at one time this area was also the center of the largest population in Eastern Ossetia.
The necropolis looks like the remains of a medieval village, with small dwellings grouped together on a grassy hill. But go closer, and you won’t find a living soul inside any of these houses. That’s because residents have been burying their dead here for hundreds of years and in each crypt human skulls and bones have been found.
The grassy hill that Dargavs is located on is dotted with little white buildings. These white, house-like structures, are stone crypts and the necropolis has almost 100 of them that rise up the hillside in a very organized manner. At the back of the entire complex is a watch tower whose top part has been destroyed. It is said that the tower was placed there to watch over the resting souls. The tombs themselves are shaped like huts with curved roofs going inwards in steps and pointed peaks at the top, typical of Nakh architecture.
Some of the bigger crypts are 2 to 4 stories high and the smaller crypts have flat sides on the front; several crypts have no roofs at all. On the inside of the larger crypts there is a pyramidal groin vault complex that holds up the roof. The smaller crypts have pointed barrel vaults. These pyramidal and conical roof vaults are built of slate in the form of stepped ledges. The walls are made up of stone blocks and mortared (most likely with lime or clay-lime) and have square, window-like openings which were designed to put corpses inside.
The people who lived in the valley buried their loved ones along with clothes and other belongings. Each family had a crypt, and the taller the tomb, the greater the number of people who were buried inside. Some have underground chambers while others have two and even three floors depending on the number of generations of family they hold. There are also common crypts, which were used for those who had no family or were from outside the village.
Interestingly, it was discovered that the bodies inside the crypts were buried in wooden structures resembling boats (one was even found with an oar next to it). The mystery remains as to how and why the boats came to be there when there are no navigable rivers nearby. One explanation is that it was believed that the departed soul had to cross a river in order to get to heaven, similar to the afterlife stories of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Another interesting fact is that there are wells in front of each crypt. Many coins have been found in the ground near the complex and it is said that when the Ossetians buried their dead, they dropped a coin in the well. If it happened to hit a stone at the bottom, that meant that the soul of the dead had reached heaven.
One legend that surrounds the cemetery says that any man who dared walk in would never come out alive again. This is said to be the reason locals almost never visit Dargavs. Another legend says that the site is where a group of warriors kidnapped a beautiful girl from a faraway land. Since they could not agree on who owned her, they killed her. The gods punished the highlanders for murder and they slowly died from a strange disease in the tombs.
Conversely, most historians believe that a great plague hit the area of Ossetia sometime between the 16th and 18th century AD; one which claimed tens of thousands of lives and dropped the Ossetian population from 200,000 at the end of the 18th century to 16,000 by the middle of 19th century. In order not to infect their neighbors, the sick, with whole families and children, went into these pre-built crypts and never came out again. They survived on meager rations of food brought in by locals and their corpses were left to rot inside the huts when they died.
There are several similar “Cities of the Dead” scattered across Ossetia, but Dargavs is considered to be the most impressive probably due to the large number of mausoleums here and the stunning natural beauty of the area.
During Soviet times, tourists came to visit by the busload, and there was even a ticket booth manned by an Ossetian babushka (Russian grandmother). The environment of Dargavs is rich in monuments from the Bronze Age to the late Middle Ages and has provided archaeologists with a wealth of information about how Ossetians in the area lived hundreds of years ago.
Despite the archaeological richness, the mystery, and the beauty of the site, these days it has all but been deserted. Rarely do tourists visit this place – which is like to be due more to the difficulty in getting to Dargavs than any death curse associated with it.",1

"Joseph Isaac Schooling has already made history by becoming the first Singaporean to reach an Olympic swimming final, and the whole nation will be watching when the 21-year oldcompetes in the men’s 100m butterfly at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio later today. Thousands of Singaporeans have taken social media to voice their support for Schooling, and if he does win it will be a truly amazing celebration across the nation.
In a post made on Facebook by Singaporean president Lee (which appears to have since been deleted, as we can’t find any trace of it on his feedanymore), he congratulated Schooling on making the final, and voiced his support for the swimmer:
Netizens across Singapore have been speculating whether PM Lee Hsien Loong may declare a public holiday on Monday if Schooling takes the gold in the event, with posts spreading across social media suggesting it would be a great decision to honour a truly momentous achievement in Singaporean sporting history. On a popular technology forum with over 100,000 Singaporean members, the following post wasmade earlier today:
[W]ondering whether our PM will declare a public holiday if Joseph Schooling won a historic gold medal in Rio Olympic ?
The resulting flow of comments by other Singaporean netizens was universally in favour of the proposal, with many pointing out that such an event, if it takes place, deserves to be recognized. Whether PM Lee will agree to a public holiday in the event that Schooling takes gold is complete speculation – at this point, PM Lee has not given any indication he would grant this (and indeed, it’s not entirely clear if he has the legislative power to declare a public holiday purely for a sporting achievement. Either way, one thing we can be sure of: Iif Schooling wins, there will be hell of a party in Singapore tonight!",1
"Cable television subscribers are leaving Comcast at a faster pace, the company reported Thursday, reflecting theimpact ofa consumer shift from traditional TV services to online channels and streaming services.
Philadelphia-based Comcast (CMCSA) reported a loss of 125,000 total video customers during the third quarter, up from the 34,000 loss the company loggedfor the April-to-June period.
Although the company reported earnings and revenues that beat Wall Street forecasts, Comcastshares were down nearly 2% at $36.09in Thursday morning trading.
The stock similarly fell in September after a Comcast executive forecastthe expected third-quarter subscriber loss during an appearance at a Merrill Lynch financial conference.

Comcast to offer commercial-free FX add-on with library of cable network series
Comcast and other traditional pay-television providers have seen cable-cutters depart in favor of popular and less-costly streaming services such as Netflix and online channel bundles they can view overthe Internet.
Similarly, ATT on Tuesday reported third-quarter losses of 134,000 pay televisioncustomers and a 251,000 decline in satellite subscribers. Both Comcast and ATT attributed some of the declines to the effects of outages and damage from recent hurricanes in Texas and Florida.
Comcast compensated for the subscriber declines with a 5.1% year-over-year jump, to $13.2 billion, in cable communications revenue driven primarily by increases in high-speed Internet, video, and business services.
Business services revenue rose 12.6% over last year's third quarter, a sign of theincreases in customers receiving small- and medium-sized business offerings, the company said.
For the quarter, Comcast reported that net income rose 18.5% to$2.65 billion, with earnings per share of 52 cents. The results beat estimates of 49 cents per share and$2.363 billion innetincome from financial analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Comcast also reported $20.98billion in revenue, a 1.6% year-over-year-decline. Excluding the financial boost that the 2016summer Olympics games in Brazil provided for last year's third quarter, revenueincreased 5.8%, Comcast said.",0
"The Las Vegas gunman's car may have been primed to explode in an escape, CBS News justice and homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues reports.
Law enforcement sources say there were at least 1,000 rounds of ammunition in a suitcase and Tannerite in a duffle bag inside the vehicle. It was in a parking garage, and investigators are trying to figure out how integral it was to Stephen Paddock's plan. Tannerite, used in target shooting, explodes when hit by rifle fire.
Paddock killed 58 people and injured more than 450 others after opening fire on concertgoers at a country music festival Sunday night.
Could he have been planning to shoot at it? Could he have used it as an explosive if fired upon by police while trying to escape? These are some of the questions investigators are considering as they try to determine a motive for the mass shooting, Pegues reports.
Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said in a news conference Friday that he doesn't know what Paddock was planning to do with the Tannerite.
""We found it in the condition that it was and it was not an [improvised explosive device],"" he said.
Authorities have been gaming out potential scenarios, among them that Paddock wanted to escape and that he might have been able to blend in amid the chaos of the fire alarms going off and crowds of people moving through the hotel, but investigators suspect a security guard interrupted his plan.
A law enforcement source says this is ""one of the most sinister things I have ever seen, and it could have been much worse.""
Investigators say among the cache of dozens of weapons seized were variants of AK-47s and AR-15s. Sources say each of the rifles Paddock had cost $1,000 or more. A source says the cache was likely worth in excess of $50,000 and probably closer to $100,000.",0
"The April jobs number was not only disappointing but it embarrassed some people and their predictions. Wall Street was looking for 220,000 new jobs for the month of April and Goldman was even more aggressive looking for 250,000 – the actual number was 160,000.The bond markets reacted by placing a 35% chance that the next move up in interest rates will take place in December of this year.
On May 12, first time jobless claims were reported at just under 300,000 a 14 month high. The first-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showed an annualized rate of one half of 1%.At this level for the first 90 days of 2016 the economic growth was about three hundreds of 1% per month, almost negligible.
Some economists are wondering if the Fed will reduce interest rates or even turn to negative rate to stimulate the economy. Currently the Fed has 25 basis points in its pocket that it can use to try and change behavior.I would suggest that money is already incredibly cheap when you look at interest rates.Why would a business want to borrow money, regardless of how cheap it appears, if they can’t make enough to cover the cost of borrowing and make a reasonable profit?
CNN Money estimates that institutions and corporations have in excess of $2 trillion that they have not brought into the United States because we have some of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.The responsibility of management is to their shareholders and to make decisions in the best interest of those shareholders. Until returns accelerate above the cost of money don’t look for corporations to borrow money or expand their businesses in the United States.
More and more economists are becoming concerned about the outlook for the next 12 months, many of which are becoming negative about the prospects for the American economy. In a report issued in mid April the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered the Global economic outlook to 3.2%. They cited two factors in making their adjustments: first is the decline in growth in China, and second are low oil prices.
Last August the Wall Street Journal estimated that oil companies would loose $4.4 trillion in revenue if oil prices stayed in the current trading range through the end of 2017. UPI reported on May 12 that they estimate that nearly 350,000 jobs have been lost in the energy sector on a global basis.Data from Houston based Graves and Company have put the layoffs in the US in excess of 100,000 jobs and growing.
It seems to me with all the negative headwinds it will be difficult for the economy to recover on its own, to an annualized GDP in excess of 2.5% anytime soon.That 2.5% number is from the Fed itself; it is their target for a growing the US economy.So what options, if any, does the Federal Reserve have to get the economy growing again?The honest answer is, “none”.They have expanded the balance sheet to over $3 trillion, they have cut interest rates to zero, and now there is talk that they may adopt the Japanese central-bank program of negative interest rates.
In the past if you bought a government bond you were paid interest every six months. Under a negative interest-rate policy you will lose money every six months because you will not be paid interest, and you will have to pay the government a fee to hold your money.Warren Buffett at his most recent shareholders meeting said, “ If the banks are going to start charging me money to keep my money in the bank I will take it out.”
The real danger is that if the economy continues to falter, businesses will begin to see less and less opportunity to make money and will no longer be able to justify keeping the employees at the current staffing levels.As a result we may find unemployment starting to rise.I’m not suggesting that we will go back to the Great Recession levels but I do believe that unemployment rates could go to 8 to 9%.
If we look at the current state of affairs then acceleration in unemployment could be devastating to millions of American families. Michael Snyder wrote an article on April 20, 2016 that had a headline of “47% of Americans could not come up with a $400 cost for an emergency room visit.” The basis for Michael’s article was an article that appeared in the Atlantic titled. “The secret shame of middle class America: and was authored by Neil Gable and is based on facts from the Federal Reserve. If the economy goes into contraction more people, I believe, will fall into this category.
With an economy that is two thirds based on consumer spending another recession would see a dramatic drop in consumer spending. With fewer people not having discretionary dollars to handle the $400 expense, there will be less money to be spent to drive the economy. One last number from Mr. Gables article, which I found to be a astounding is that 71% of Americans are concerned that they have enough money to cover their household expenses.
If workers and management see diminished prospects for themselves, their companies and the country, then lower interest rates will not solve the problem. The only way to solve the problem is to turn loose the great entrepreneurial spirit of America, by reducing regulations and taxes, and creating opportunities for capital formation to expand the American dream.",1
"The letters from the trade groups come in the immediate aftermathof FHA’s annual Actuarial Report which showed the FHA to be making steady progress instrengtheningFHA’s finances.
In open letters to HUD and the FHA, leaders from theCommunity Home Loan Association say the costs of doing FHA-insured mortgages is artificially high.
The Community Home Lenders Association also renewed its call for the FHA to lower the annual premiums it charges, in order to make FHA loans more affordable for lower and middle income homebuyers.
“We commend the FHA for the work it has done to stabilize the finances of FHA,” Scott Olson, Executive Director ofCHLA,said. “This makes it possible to balance this continuing progress in building up the FHA Fund with the objective of improving access to credit and increased homeownership opportunities for qualified homebuyers.”
The CHLA says that this change would“allow FHA to more fully meet its mission of affordable mortgage credit, while at the same time maintaining a steady buildup in the FHA MMIF Fund.”
The community bankers, it should be said, are not the only ones to lobby for this change. The Mortgage Bankers Association are also asking for a break.
“MBA has been a consistent supporter of FHA throughout its 80-year history. We recognize the need for FHA to be on a sound financial footing so that it can support its mission of providing financing to first-time homebuyers and other underserved borrowers,” said Bill Cosgrove, chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association. “At this time, however, MBA thinks mortgage insurance premiums are counterproductively high and recommends that they be reduced to better serve borrowers and meet FHA’s stated policy objectives.”
The FHA has a statutory mandate to recapitalize the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund in order to achieve a two percent capital ratio. That ratio currently stands at 0.41%.
The rate of recapitalization is affected by a tradeoff between the pricing of FHA insurance on one hand, and the corresponding volume of endorsements and their credit quality, on the other.
High insurance premiums tend to decrease volume and worsen credit quality, a dynamic that is exacerbated when there are other competitive sources of mortgage funds available in the market.
“…We recommend that FHA lower premium rates to reflect what has been learned from the most recent rounds of increases, namely that the gain in premium revenue was more than offset by a loss of volume and a drop in credit quality for new endorsements,” he said. “For the medium term, FHA should prioritize their objectives of strengthening the economic value of the fund, and increasing their support for first-time homebuyers in the market, allowing a longer time before reaching their target mix of business.”
The letter calls on FHA to reduce premiums as a means of fulfilling its mission of increasing affordability especially for first time and minority borrows.
CHLA first calledfor a reduction inFHA premiums last February, in a letter to OMB calling for a reduction in the annual premium level from 1.35% to .75%.
This latest letter renews this call, and points out that the cost of this could be partially offset with an increase in upfront premiums, which do not have the same impact on affordability, and also with increased revenues resulting from more borrowers qualifying for an FHA loan.
In the letter, CHLA notesthat an estimated 125,000 to 375,000 borrowers would have purchased a home in 2013 with an FHA loan except for FHA’s recent hikes in annual premiums.
The letter also notes that FHA home purchase volume has fallen by more than 40% since 2010, and has experienced comparable declines in loans to African-Americans and Hispanic homebuyers.",1
"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says the valuationofthe record-breaking U. S. stock market isn't as expensive as itmight appear given the low level of interest rates.
""Valuations make sense with interest rates where they are,"" Buffett said in an interview Tuesday aired on CNBC. Low borrowing costs, he said,have been a ""powerful factor"" in equities values.
The 10-year U. S. Treasury bond now yields about 2.34%, which is low relative to historical standards.
With long-term interest rates at depressed levels, Buffett, who appeared on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,""said stocks ""will do considerably better than bonds.""
Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said:""If I had a choice I would take stocks at this point.""
The U. S. stock market is at record high levels, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 14.1% heading into Tuesday's trading session.
On Monday, all four of the major U. S. stock indexes, representing blue chipstocks, large-company shares, small-caps and tech names, all hit record highs. All four stock gauges were trading at fresh records in early trading Tuesday.
The Oracle of Omaha also said future short-term rate increases from the Federal Reserve —which is expected to hike short-term rates for a third time this year when it meets next in December —won't influence his investment decisions.
""I can't remember a decision we ever made based on the Fed,"" Buffett said, stressing he buys shares of companies he likes rather than playing the overall market.
Buffett, however, said stocks would be less attractive if the yield on the 10-year U. S. government bond were 5% or 6%.
""You would have a whole different valuation standpoint"" to consider, Buffett said.
Currently, the Standard & Poor's 500, a broad measure of the U. S. stock market, is trading at nearly 20 times its estimated earnings for 2017, which is higher than the five-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 18.4 and the average P-E of 18.8 since 1988, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Earlier today, Buffett's Berkshshire Hathaway said it was taking a minority equity stake of 38.6% in Pilot Flying J, a privately held company and largest operator of travel centers in the U. S. catering to the trucking industry. Pilot Flying J provides truckers with access to 70,000 parking spaces, nearly 5,000 showers and more than 5,000 diesel fuel lanes used for refueling.
At a party for Forbes magazine's centennial last month, Buffett said he sees the Dow at over 1 million a century from now.
The Dow closed on Monday at a record of 22,557, the 43rd all-time high set this year.
From the November election that saw Donald Trump elected president to Monday's close, the Dow gained 22%, the Standard & Poor's 500rose about 17.8%, and the Nasdaq surged 25%.
When Buffett was on CNBC in August, he said he was disappointed that Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton but stressed he's not in the ""business of attacking any president"" nor does he think he should be.

"An ancient wooden humanoid statue unearthed in Russia125 years ago, has now been carbon dated, confirming that it is at least 3 times as old as the pyramids in Egypt.
New carbon dating places Siberia’s Shigir Idol at 13,000 years old, more than three times as old as Stonehenge and the Pyramids—but scientists are still puzzling over its secret symbols.
An enigmatic wooden idol that has puzzled archaeologists since it was unearthed in aSiberianbog 125 years ago revealed a little more about itself last week.
Newcarbon datinghas indicated that the 9-foot-tall sculpture is much older than previously thought, though there are still no clues to decode its mysterious markings.
The statue, known as the Shigir Idol, already had the distinction of being the oldest wooden structure in the world. The idol, which dates to 11,000 BC, is more than three times as old as thePyramids, from 3,000 BC, or Stonehenge, from 2600 BC.
It was discovered 13 feet below a peat bog western Siberia in 1890. It had been broken into pieces, but the anti-bacterial quality of peat had preserved the coding—etched long ago with small stones—that covered its exterior. The symbols formed a complex series of wavy, straight and zig-zagged lines.
The statue first stood over 17 feet tall, but since its discovery some pieces of the statue have been lost to history—though original drawings drafted by a Russian archaeologist remain. The statue wasn’t dated for more than 100 years, until 1997, when a radiocarbon test estimated it to be 9,500 years old. Now, researchers in Germany have added 1,500 years to that, placing its origin at the beginning of the Holocene era.
The German team from the Lower Saxony State Office for Cultural Heritage began work to precisely date the statue last year, using a technique called accelerated mass spectrometry. The testing was done using samples taken in the ’90s and determined when the wood, taken from a larch tree, had grown.
“This is an extremely important data for the international scientific community. It is important for understanding the development of civilisation and the art of Eurasia and humanity as a whole,” Professor Thomas Terberger, one of those who worked to date the idol, said at apress conferenceannouncing the findings on Thursday. “We can say that in those times, 11,000 years ago, the hunters, fishermen and gatherers of the Urals were no less developed than the farmers of the Middle East.”
The statue has one large three-dimensional face and six other flat faces scattered throughout its designs. But the mysterious line etchings have long puzzled historians. It lives at the Yekaterinburg History Museum, where Svetlana Savchenko is the senior researcher and keeper of the idol.
He toldThe Siberian Timeslast year that he believes it to be the interpretation of “the creation of the world.”
Researchers at the museum told the paper that one theory dictates the statue was a map or a navigation device leading the user on a journey depicted with landscape indicators and travel time.
Some believe the symbols represent spirits or different mythical stories. Others believe the scratches are writing, which would make it the oldest recorded written language.
Scientific analysis is keeping mum on the rest of Shigir Idol’s secrets. Its markings, Professor Mikhail Zhilin, of the Russian Academy of Sciences,toldThe Siberian Times, remain “an utter mystery to modern man.”",1
"Tragically, 95.6% of former National Football League (NFL) players who donated their brains to science tested positive for a brain disease. The disease is linked with repeated head trauma and concussions.
The former players were found to have had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, according to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University.
However, the study results don’t necessarily mean that 96percentof all NFL players are at risk for CTE. The brains came from players who, while they were alive, had concerns about CTE.
It’s not clear why some players develop the disease and others don’t.
The data was published on the website for the Concussion Legacy Foundation and first reported by the documentary TV program “Frontline.”
The NFL said it had taken several steps to make play safer. Among the changes in recent years has been conducting pregame medical assessments of players, along with on-field and postgame assessments of players involved in hard hits. Another has been moving the kickoff spot 5 yards forward, reducing the number of kick returns.
“We are dedicated to making football safer and continue to take steps to protect players, including rule changes, advanced sideline technology and expanded medical resources,” the league said. “We continue to make significant investments in independent research through our gifts to Boston University, the (National Institutes of Health) and other efforts to accelerate the science and understanding of these issues.”
In May, Dr. Russ Lonser, chairman of the NFL’s Head, Neck and Spine Subcommittee, said there has been a 25percentreduction in concussions and 40 percentreduction in helmet-to-helmet hits in the past three seasons.
CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma.
The brain tissue of people found to have CTE displays an abnormal build-up of tau — a protein that, when it spills out of cells, can choke off, or disable, neural pathways controlling things like memory, judgment and fear.
CTE can be diagnosed only after death.
Earlier this year, the NFL and thousands of former players settled a lawsuit that provides up to $5 million per retired player for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma.
While the lawsuit was a combination of hundreds of actions brought by more than 5,000 former players, it may apply to as many as 20,000 former ex-NFLers.",1
"If you regularly save money (whether for retirement or other purposes), you've made a smart financial choice. What's more, the government wants to reward responsible people like you by offering these four great tax breaks just for savers.
Contribute to a traditional IRA (not a Roth IRA) and you may be eligible for a fat tax deduction. If you're not covered by a workplace retirement plan such as a 401(k), you're automatically eligible to deduct your IRA contributions in full on your federal tax return (although you still can't exceed the annual contribution limit -- in 2017, that's $5,500 for everyone under 50).
If you are covered by a workplace retirement plan, your IRA deduction may be limited based on your annual income and tax filing status. If you file as single or head of household, you can take a full IRA deduction with an annual income of up to $62,000; a partial deduction if your income is between $62,000 and $72,000; and no deduction if your income is $72,000 or more. For married filing jointly, the income limits are $99,000 or less (full deduction), more than $99,000 but less than $119,000 (partial deduction), and $119,000 or more (no deduction).
Assuming you qualify for an IRA deduction, you simply total up your contributions for the year, apply any limitations based on your annual income, then note the final figure on your Form 1040. The IRA deduction is a particularly useful one because it's a ""for AGI"" deduction, meaning that it's subtracted from your income before you do the annual gross income calculation. That means the IRA deduction can reduce your annual gross income, potentially making you eligible for other income-dependent tax breaks such as the Earned Income Credit.
If you have a health savings account, you can deduct the amount you contribute for the year on your federal tax return. Like the IRA deduction, this is a ""for AGI"" deduction taken on your Form 1040, so it can be a particularly powerful tax break.
There is a limit to how much you're allowed to contribute to an HSA for the year. In 2017, the limits are $3,400 for individual HSAs and $6,750 for family HSAs. These limits are slated to increase slightly for 2018. However, if tax reform passes in time to apply for the 2018 tax year, HSA contribution limits may increase far more dramatically than that. President Trump has repeatedly stated his intention to greatly increase HSA contribution limits so that savers can get more from these accounts. The increase in HSA limits was originally slated to be part of the Trumpcare bill, but since health care reform is currently on hold, the HSA contribution limit increase might just work its way into tax reform legislation instead.
More:Retirees: 4 ways you can start planning for possible tax law changes now
If you contribute money to pretty much any type of retirement savings account and you meet certain income limits, you may qualify for a tax credit in addition to any tax deduction that applies to these contributions. The Savers Tax Credit allows you to claim a tax credit of up to $1,000 (or $2,000 if you're married filing jointly). Because it's a credit rather than a deduction, it's directly subtracted from your tax bill. This is one tax break that's definitely too good to pass up, so if you qualify, grab a copy of Form 8880, fill it out, and turn it in with the rest of your federal tax return.
In some ways, the 401(k) deduction is the best of the many saver tax breaks. Why? Because you don't have to do anything to claim it (other than contribute money to your 401(k)).
When you set up your 401(k) contribution, typically in the form of a percentage of your paycheck, your company will take the money out of your pre-tax salary. For example, let's say that your pre-tax paycheck is $4,000 per month and you've set it up with HR to contribute 10% to your 401(k). Your employer would then take $400 from that pre-tax money and put it into your 401(k) account, leaving $3,600 on which to calculate your tax withholdings.
So instead of having to add up your contributions for the year, calculate your deduction, and slap the result on your tax return, you just quietly enjoy the tax break you get as a result of having your annual income reduced by your 401(k) contributions before you even touch your paycheck. Not only is your tax bill reduced, but you have one less task ahead of you when preparing your tax return.

White House Orders The Hiring Of 15,000 New Immigration Agents
Steve Inskeep talks to James Tomsheck, former head of internal affairs for the U. S. Customs and Border Protection, who worries hiring the agents at one time could lead to corruption and misconduct.
Trump administration officials have acknowledged one huge obstacle as they work to tighten border enforcement. It's a basic reality. Although the president once promised to remove all 11 million people in the United States without documents, there is a limited number of border guards, limited number of immigration agents, limited number of immigration judges. That reality helps to explain why this White House, like the last White House, is not trying to remove everyone at the moment. They've acknowledged that's impossible. White House spokesman Sean Spicer did say yesterday the president is hoping to change that over time.
SEAN SPICER: This includes immediately identifying and allocating all sources of available funding for the planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall along our southern border - and hiring of additional personnel, including 5,000 additional CBP border agents.
INSKEEP: Five thousand new Border Patrol officers along with new immigration agents - thousands of them as well - these are meaningful increases on the current force, although it is also an approach that's been tried before, as James Tomsheck knows. He headed Customs and Border Protection's internal affairs department until about two and a half years ago, and he's in our studios.
INSKEEP: Didn't the Border Patrol try to double its strength in the last couple of decades?
TOMSHECK: Exactly that. Between the period of August 2006 to December 2012, the Border Patrol was actually doubled in size from...
INSKEEP: From about 10,000 to about 20,000?
TOMSHECK: Certainly, there were problems along the way. I came from an environment in the U.S. Secret Service where pre-employment polygraphs were a part of how we determined suitability.
INSKEEP: Lie detectors. Is someone lying about their background? OK.
TOMSHECK: Exactly, a standard, federal law enforcement polygraph exam designed by the Center for Credibility Assessment, used throughout the federal law enforcement community - at FBI, Secret Service, DEA, ATF, etc. That was not the case at Customs and Border Protection. With the support of Commissioner Ralph Basham, we received authorization to institute a polygraph screening program and ran those first exams in February of 2008, towards the end of the initial Border Patrol hiring.
INSKEEP: And what did you find?
TOMSHECK: The results were shocking. More than half of the applicants failed to clear the exam, with the overwhelming majority giving us detailed admissions as to why it was they failed the exam. It was what these applicants had done in their past that most concerned us. They included serious felony crimes, active involvement in smuggling activities and several confirmed infiltrators who actually were employed by drug trafficking organizations who had been directed to seek out positions within Customs and Border Protection to advance ongoing criminal conspiracies, essentially be spies in our midst.
INSKEEP: I want to underline what you're telling me because you're talking about border enforcement agents who may be working alone or in small groups in remote areas. They're doing sensitive things. They're fighting against drug traffic. They're fighting against human trafficking. And you're saying you found a very large number of people who were - based on their backgrounds, they could be compromised.
TOMSHECK: They were certainly very vulnerable to being compromised, absolutely unsuitable to serve as federal law enforcement officers. And the worst, again, were persons who already had an ongoing relationship with a criminal organization.
INSKEEP: And I want to mention something else because our colleague John Burnett has reported on this a lot - there was a number of cases of shootings along the border of civilians being shot by border agents. And some people connected that to the increase in the Border Patrol. It was just hard, it was said, to find thousands of competent, capable people that you wanted to be Border Patrol agents with guns.
TOMSHECK: That's exactly the case. We're asking these new Border Patrol agents and CBP officers to accept postings in some very difficult environments along this southwest border. As a matter of fact, the vast majority of applicants from other-than-border communities are reluctant to move to southwest border communities.
INSKEEP: The best people don't want to do that work.
TOMSHECK: Not necessarily the best people, but...
INSKEEP: Some of the best people. OK, yeah.
TOMSHECK: Exactly that. But the reality is the hiring initiative, time and time again, visited southwest border communities over the course of those two years and four months that that initial hiring initiative moved forward. At some point in time, the quality of the applicant pool sharply declined. And yet, the mandate to double the size of the Border Patrol remained in progress.
INSKEEP: And we should be fair - you've been along the border; I've been along the border. You meet lots of capable people, dedicated people doing really hard work. But when you hear the Trump administration say we're going to hire 5,000 more people - we're going to really ramp this up, what goes through your mind?
TOMSHECK: The first thing that I want to hear the rest of is the next sentence is - over a period of time that allows for proper suitability determinations that doesn't compromise the current and future integrity of the organization.
INSKEEP: What could possibly go wrong here?
TOMSHECK: If there's an effort to hire too many people too quickly, it would certainly stress the personnel security determination process to the point that it would inject errors and deeply concern that there may be an initiative at DHS or CBP to dilute the effectiveness of the polygraph program or, in some instances, actually obtain waivers.
INSKEEP: Could the United States actually make itself less secure by rapidly hiring more people?
TOMSHECK: I don't think there's any question that if we hire people that are grossly unsuitable for the position and place them in critical, sensitive positions along the southwest border, not only would it not enhance security, it would likely compromise security.
INSKEEP: In a couple seconds - from what you've heard, does the administration seem aware of this danger?
TOMSHECK: I don't know that. What I do know, again, is that there have been efforts on the part of CBP leadership to remove some of the questions from the polygraph - something that is beyond my comprehension, something that actually they're not allowed to do.
INSKEEP: OK. James Tomsheck, thanks for coming by.
TOMSHECK: Thanks for having me, Steve.
INSKEEP: He's a former inspector general for Customs and Border Protection.

A previous headline on this story said the White House ordered the hiring of 15,000 new border agents. The order is for the hiring of 5,000 new Border Patrol agents and 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, who work in the interior of the country.",0
"According to Russia’s special envoy the US may be underestimating the threat of ISIS in Afghanistan saying that there are already more than 10,000 fighters there and more arriving from Syria and Iraq.
Zamir Kabulov, the head of the Middle East department in the Russian Foreign Ministry, said that when the terror group was pushed out of their bases in Syria and Iraq this year many of them fled to Afghanistan.
RT reports: “Russia was among the first nations to ring alarm about the expansion of IS into Afghanistan,” he told RIA Novosti. “Lately IS has boosted its presence in the country. Our estimate is that their force there is stronger than 10,000 troops and is continuing to grow. That includes new fighters with combat experience received in Syria and Iraq.”
IS forces are strongest in the north of Afghanistan on the border with Tajikistan and Turkmenistan – a point of concern for Russia, which has close historic ties with both nations, Kabulov added.
“IS goals are definitely to expand its influence outside of Afghanistan, which they use as a staging ground. This poses a significant security threat for Central Asia and southern parts of Russia,” Kabulov stressed.
The diplomat said Russia and the US have a difference of opinion about how big a threat IS poses in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Washington, he said, is focused on fighting the Taliban and is in the process of alienating other nations in the region, which America criticizes for failing to put enough pressure on the militant movement, while overlooking its own failures.
“Considering the realities on the ground, which is that the Taliban controls half of the country, one can ask the question: does the US pull its weight? Russia stands for cooperation with international partners based on equality and which takes into account national interests of all nations of the region,” Kabulov said, apparently referring to Washington’s resent showdown with Pakistan.
The US accused Islamabad of failing to properly fight the Taliban and threatened it with repercussions unless Pakistan ramps up counterinsurgency operations in its tribal areas. The criticism sparked some anti-America sentiment among Pakistani military commanders.
Kabulov said Moscow was prepared to work together with Washington to foster stability in Afghanistan, and said it was America’s decision to stop such cooperation, not Russia’s. In April, Moscow invited the US to take part in Russia-hosted Afghanistan peace talks, but the US declined to participate.",1

With Christmas just around the corner, it’s easy to get wrapped up in the trees, twinkling lights and presents. So when one woman drove by a McDonald’s restaurant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and saw something shocking in the window, she immediately snapped a picture.
The employees at this McDonald’s made a huge statement with their unique and very powerful window display.
These days, it’s common for people, especially young children, to not understand or acknowledge the true meaning of Christmas. With all the hoopla surrounding Santa, his eight reindeer and bag of toys, people forget about the birth of Jesus on a cold winter night.
Fortunately, Amy Basel recently visited a McDonald’s that not only recognized the meaning behind the joyous holiday, but is displaying it proudly for everyone in the city to see.
Amy is the founder of Your Path, His Plan, a blog where she speaks and writes about the power of God’s love. With His love and acceptance, Amy was able to let go of her troubled past and follow the light. Sharing the gospel and empowering generations is what Amy loves to do now and it’s why she was so happy when she saw the McDonald’s nativity scene drawn on the windows.
Amy immediately posted a picture of the McDonald’s display on her Facebook wall with the caption:
“Drove by and did a double-take. Growing up in The Mitten, you would NEVER see this. Tennessee McDonald’s… You made my day
‘His name is Jesus.’”
In a day and age where Santa is more popular than Jesus, it was refreshing to see some people still understood the true importance of the holiday.
If you look closely you can see two very powerful displays of faith. On each side of the nativity scene someone wrote, “His name is Jesus” and “Rejoice.”
In the time since Amy posted the photo, it has gone viral! Her post has been shared more than 82,000 times and liked by nearly 138,000 users – and it’s easy to see why!
The thought of a huge corporation like McDonald’s spreading Christmas cheer like this is very much respected and appreciated by millions of proud Christians.

"But first: The drug crisis in America today is killing more people each year than AIDS, gun deaths or car crashes did at their peaks.
Tonight, we look at the role of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid increasingly driving that high mortality rate, pushing law enforcement, health professionals and lawmakers to search for new solutions.

"(Before It's News)Using five different scientific approaches, a team including University of Wyoming researchers has given considerable support to the idea that humans lived year-round in the Andean highlands of South America over 7,000 years ago.
Examining human remains and other archaeological evidence from a site at nearly 12,500 feet above sea level in Peru, the scientists show that intrepid hunter-gatherers — men, women and children — managed to survive at high elevation before the advent of agriculture, in spite of lack of oxygen, frigid temperatures and exposure to elements.
Intrepid hunter-gatherer families permanently occupied high-elevation environments of the Andes Mountains at least 7,000 years ago, according to new research led by University of Wyoming scientists.

“This gives us a very strong baseline to help understand the rates of cultural and genetic change in the Andean highlands, a region known for the domestication of alpaca, potatoes and other plants; emergence of state-level political and economic complexity; and rapid human adaptation to high-elevation life,” says Randy Haas, a postdoctoral research associate in the University of Wyoming’s Department of Anthropology and the team’s leader.
The research appears in the July issue of Royal Society Open Science, a peer-reviewed, open-access scientific journal. Along with Haas, the second author is Ioana Stefenescu, graduate student in UW’s Department of Geology and Geophysics. Also contributing to the paper were Alexander Garcia-Putnam, doctoral student in the UW Department of Anthropology; Mark Clementz, associate professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics; Melissa Murphy, associate professor in the Department of Anthropology; and researchers from the University of California-Davis, the University of California-Merced, the University of Arizona and Peruvian institutions.
Excavations led by Haas at the site in southern Peru produced the remains of 16 people, along with more than 80,000 artifacts, dating to as early as 8,000 years ago. Evidence from that site, as well as others, has led some researchers to estimate that hunter-gatherers began living in the Andes around 9,000 years ago, but debate has continued over whether that human presence was permanent or seasonal.
The research team led by Haas took five different approaches to test whether there was early permanent use of the region: studying the human bones for oxygen and carbon isotopes; the travel distances from the site to low-elevation zones; the demographic mixture of the human remains; and the types of tools and other materials found with them.
The scientists found low oxygen and high carbon isotope values in the bones, revealing the distinct signature of permanent high-elevation occupation; that travel distances to low-elevation zones were too long for seasonal human migration; that the presence of women and small children meant such migration was highly unlikely; and that almost all of the tools used by the hunter-gatherers were made with high-elevation stone material, not brought from elsewhere.
“These results constitute the strongest evidence to date that people were living year-round in the Andean highlands at least 7,000 years ago,” Haas says. “Such high-elevation environments were among the last frontiers of human colonization, and this knowledge holds implications for understanding rates of genetic, physiological and cultural adaption in the human species.

"Councils and housing associations have welcomed government plans to spend 2bn on a ""new generation"" of council houses and affordable homes for rent.
In her conference speech, Theresa May pledged to dedicate her premiership to fixing the ""broken"" housing market.
The state, she said, must get ""back in the business"" of building subsidised rented homes for those not able to buy.
Labour and housing charities said the plan would only help a fraction of the 1.2 million families awaiting housing.
The government said the 2bn injection could fund 25,000 homes for social rent by 2021 although the National Housing Federation said the figure could rise to between 50,000 and 60,000 if the government's intervention unlocked, as it is hoped, a further 3bn in public and private investment.
Speaking in Manchester, the prime minister - who was interrupted by a prankster and battled with a persistent cough during a troubled speech - said the UK's housing market was ""broken"", with falling levels of home ownership, demand outstripping supply and the high cost of renting in the private sector shutting millions of people out.
Promising to ""take personal charge"" of ""getting government back into the business of building houses"", she told builders to ""do your duty to Britain and build the homes our country needs"".
""So whether you're trying to buy your own, renting privately and looking for more security, or have been waiting for years on a council list, help is on its way,"" she said.
The government said the 2bn it was making available would unlock a further 3bn in public and private investment in all types of housing.
In areas of the country where rents were high, the focus will be on increasing the supply of social housing - where rents are set at a typical discount of 30% to 40% to the market rate.
The policy marks a departure from that of the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition which focused on ""affordable"" homes for rent, where tenants paid higher rents of up to 80% of the market value.
David Orr, from the National Housing Federation, said it marked the first injection of funding into the social rented sector since 2010 and marked a move away from a sole focus on increasing owner-occupation.
""It will make a big difference,"" he told BBC News.
However, he said the success of the scheme would depend on increasing availability of public land. ""It is really important that the government accepts that it has a critical role to play,"" he added.
Shelter's Polly Neate welcomed the shift in emphasis to affordable renting but said 2bn would not go a long way to helping the 1.2 million families in England waiting for a council house - a statistic she said represented ""an enormous amount of human suffering"".
Labour said the number of new houses being proposed was ""paltry"" and it had pledged at the election to build more than 60,000 social homes for rent within two years.
The Local Government Association, which represents more than 300 councils in England and Wales, said it hoped it marked a ""significant shift"" in the government's housing policy.
While it did not expect a return to the late 1970s, when councils built more than 40% of new homes, it said local authorities wanted to ""get on with the job"" of building, particularly in areas of real need.
""It is good the government has accepted our argument that councils must be part of the solution to our chronic housing shortage and able to resume their historic role as a major builder of affordable homes,"" its chairman Lord Porter said.
""Councils are working with communities to approve nine in 10 planning applications but it is clear that only an increase of all types of housing - including those for affordable or social rent - will solve the housing crisis.""
However, the LGA reiterated its call for restrictions on councils being able to borrow to spend on building new homes to be lifted.
The Institute for Economic Affairs said the UK already had more social housing stock than France, Spain and Germany and the highest number of tenants living in subsidised rental properties.
The free market think tank said the government needed to focus on removing supply-side obstacles to house building, such as unnecessary and onerous planning regulations.",0
"Hurricane Irma, the most powerful Atlantic Ocean hurricane in recorded history, tore through a string of Caribbean islands Wednesday, knocking down buildings and disrupting power as it settled into a likely track for a weekend landing in southern Florida. At least three people are reported dead.
In St. Martin and St. Barthelemy, at least two people died and at least two others were seriously wounded, a spokesperson for France’s ministry for its overseas territories told ABC News. An infant died in Barbuda, where as many as 95% of structures were damaged, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda Gaston Browne told CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360.”
In Florida, South Carolina and Georgia, officials declared states of emergency and enacted defensive measures against a full onslaught from the 185-mph storm.
Florida Gov. Rick Scott activated 1,000 National Guard members as local authorities issued mandatory evacuation orders for the Florida Keys and low-lying areas on the mainland.
“We can rebuild your home, we can’t rebuild your life,” he cautioned anyone contemplating riding out Irma.
The governor warned Irma’s unpredictable track could range from the Florida Panhandle to the East Coast and that the entire state should be prepared.
Scott emphasized Irma would be stronger and larger than Hurricane Andrew, the Category 5 storm that in 1992 killed 65 people in Florida, destroyed more than 63,500 homes and caused $26.5 billion in damage.
Evacuation orders for parts of Miami-Dade County, including Miami Beach, were set to take effect 7 a.m. Thursday. In the Florida Keys, orders took effect 7 p.m. ET Wednesday night and were set to take effect noon Thursday in Broward County.
A sign at the Marriott Key Largo Bay resort alerts customers that it’s closed due to the Hurricane Irma evacuation from the Florida Keys.
In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency. “We got this,” McMaster said. “We can’t stop the hurricane. If it comes, it’s going to be here, but we can be ready for it.”
Meanwhile, Florida officials worked to keep bottled water and fuel flowing into areas where local residents were either stocking up to stay or getting ready to pull out.
In Key Largo, Fla., a steady stream of vehicles, many towing boats, flowed off the Keys toward Miami Wednesday afternoon.
“People are pretty calm now that it’s shifted a little bit more east, but everyone is still preparing,” said gas station owner Ray Ochoa, 42.
Ochoa said his Key Largo Chevron station ran out of gas Tuesday, with high hurricane demand coming atop the traditionally heavy Labor Day end of the tourist season.
“It’s a hell of a way to close out the season,” he said, looking at his five plastic-wrapped pumps. He estimated he’ll lose $6,000 in revenue a day by closing. “The sheriff told me there’s no gas left on the Keys.”
The pressure to take immediate safety measures built throughout Wednesday as Irma swept west out of the open Atlantic and chewed through a string of islands, including St. Martin, Barbuda, Anguilla and St. Barts.
Irma seemed likely to scrape the northern sections of the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Cuba, while directly targeting the Bahamas, Virgin Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands.
By 10 p.m. ET, Irma was about 70 miles north by northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, packing maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was moving toward the west-northwest at 16 mph.
The U. S. State Department warned Americans to reconsider travel to Cuba, Haiti or the Dominican Republic due to the expected impact of the storm. U.S. Navy officials, however, decided not to evacuate the Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, on Cuba’s eastern tip, but did order an evacuation of non-essential personnel at Naval Air Station Key West.
Michel Magras, senator on the small French-speaking island of St. Barts, sent a text describing the “monster that passes over us,” FranceInfo.com reported. “It is apocalyptic, a lot of damage, a lot of roofs torn off,” he wrote.
On St. Martin, the half-French, half-Dutch island of around 80,000 people directly in the path of the storm, the relentless winds ripped off the roof of the main hospital.
French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said government buildings on St. Martin had been destroyed, AFP reported.
“We know that the four most solid buildings on the island have been destroyed which means that more rustic structures have probably been completely or partially destroyed,” he told reporters. The island prefect, an official appointed by France, and 23 staff took shelter in a concrete-lined room.
Previous hurricanes with Irma’s ferocity, such as Hurricane Wilma in 2005 and Hurricane Mitch in 1998, reached maximum intensity in either the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea.
“The chance of direct impacts from Irma beginning later this week and this weekend from wind, storm surge and rainfall continues to increase in the Florida Keys and portions of the Florida Peninsula,” the National Hurricane Center said. “However, it is too soon to specify the timing and magnitude of these impacts.”
Aut Smith, 42, and Willie Young, 52, load up sandbags for the community at the City of Gainesville Public Works Department, Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2017 in Gainesville, Fla. “We are happy to be here helping people,” said Young, who has been working for the city for 32 years.
President Trump has declared emergencies in Florida, Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands, and authorities in the Bahamas said they would evacuate six southern islands.
The U. S. Coast Guard strongly urged mariners to leave the Port of Key West, noting that it is safest when it has a minimum number of vessels. The Coast Guard ordered all oceangoing vessels and barges to head out to sea ahead of the onset of gale force winds.
It’s been 25 years since a Category 5 hurricane struck the U. S., and Irma could potentially become just the fourth storm of that strength to barrel into the nation. Category 5 hurricanes destroy a high percentage of homes, often causing total roof failure and wall collapses. Fallen trees and power poles isolate residential areas. Power outages last for weeks or months. And areas can be uninhabitable for the same time frame.
“Watching Hurricane closely. My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!” Trump tweeted Wednesday.
In addition to Irma, Hurricanes Katia and Jose formed on Wednesday. Katia is in the Bay of Campeche near Mexico, and should meander around for a few days before hitting the east coast of Mexico by the weekend. Jose is in the open Atlantic Ocean and could impact the Leeward Islands by the weekend.
This is the first time since 2010 that there have been three hurricanes at the same time in the Atlantic, according to Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach",1

Sometimes things don’t go according to plan – and then you have a choice. Either you mope around and feel sorry for yourself, or you laugh about the situation and keep looking forward.
When Norwegian Claus Jrstad had an embarrassing incident in the shower with his newly bought IKEA stool, he decided to do the latter – and shared his experience in a humorous Facebook post.
What he didn’t know was that the story would become an internet sensation.
What happened was that Claus Jrstad had a bad knee, so he decided that it would be a good idea to get a stool so he could sit down in the shower.
After looking at different alternatives at IKEA, he decided to go for the “Marius” stool since it was made out of steel and plastic, and was comfy.
But there was one thing that Claus had forgotten about: the stool had 8 small holes in it, something that would soon cause an uncomfortable problem. On his Norwegian Facebook page, he writes about the incident:
“Once I got home, I put my new piece of furniture in the shower and got in, this time without clothes. I calmly sat down on the stool and soaped up my whole body, including the ‘captain’ and his ‘two sailors’. As you might imagine, the sailors are what dangles between my legs, but since this is a public Facebook post I’ll stick to more flowery language.”
“So, when the deck got slippery and the captain and his crew got dizzy from all the foam, they started sliding around like drunk sailors!” Claus writes, and continues:
“Then something terrible happened. A sailor unwittingly made his escape and slid down one of the holes in the stool. I didn’t notice at first, but as you know things tend to expand when they are warmed up. And when a sailor gets really hot, then he really expands in size. I didn’t notice this until I tried standing up, only to find that the stool was hanging on behind me, and a searing white pain went through me like lightning. That good-for-nothing sailor was stuck in the hole!”
“So there I sat. And sat. I was thinking about my predicament and trying to figure a way out of it. I couldn’t pull up the sailor, and I wasn’t sure if I would be able to push him up from below without having to go to the hospital. So I kept sitting there, pondering,” Claus writes.
But as he was sitting there in the accidental trap, the problem started solving itself:
“I sat there until I ran out of hot water – and when the hot water runs out, you get cold, terribly cold.” he writes, and continues:
“Since I started getting cold, I thought about how I could keep warm, so I tried reaching for the hair dryer… and guess what happened?!? The cold had made that damn sailor shrink again, and with a pop I was a free man once more!”
The honest story made readers double over with laughter, and in just one day he received 25,000 likes and 12,000 shares. On the same day, IKEA wrote an ingenious Facebook comment:
“Hello Claus. We’re sorry to hear that your crew got in trouble and that the Coast Guard almost had to intervene. We recommend you take this stool out of the shower and put a nice flower pot on it.
If you do decide to keep it in the shower, then make sure that you’re wearing the right clothing for a rough day at sea – we recommend putting on a sou’wester. Have a great day,” writes IKEA.
I think this was a great example of someone able to laugh at themselves!

"As we continue to dissect everything that happened in London, tensions are still running high. Take a look at this exchange between a British citizen and a liberal reporter who tried to corner him.
Robinson was speaking with Rebel Media’s Caolan Robertson on the unsurprising nature of the incident in light of the suspected perpetrator’s identity being released.
“This isn’t a shock to me,” said Robinson. “I don’t understand people who are surprised by this. We have over 3,000 Muslims who are monitored 24 hours a day 7 days a week at a cost of nine billion [pounds] a year. We’re following them, waiting for them to do this.”

"Just two years after Cecil the lion was killed in similar circumstances, one of his cubs has been shot dead by a big game trophy hunter in Zimbabwe.
The six-year-old lion named Xanda was killed just outside the Hwange National Park in north west Zimbabwe, not far from where Cecil was killed in 2015.
Cecil was found beheaded and skinned near the Park in 2015 after Walter Palmer, a 55 year old dentist from Minneapolis, paid a $55,000 (35,000) to wildlife guides to allow him to shoot the lion with a crossbow. He was forced to abandon his practice in Minneapolis for weeks amid international outrage over his actions.
Richard Cooke, the professional hunter accused of killing Xanda, also reportedly killed the cubs’ brother in 2015.
Andrew Loveridge, from the Department of Zoology at Oxford University,toldThe Daily Telegraph: “I fitted it last October. It was monitored almost daily and we were aware that Xanda and his pride was spending a lot of time out of the park in the last six months, but there is not much we can do about that.”
He added: “Richard Cooke is one of the ‘good’ guys. He is ethical and he returned the collar and communicated what had happened.
“His hunt was legal and Xanda was over 6 years old so it is all within the stipulated regulations.”
Lions of Hwange National Park wrote on Facebook: “Today we heard that a few days ago, Xanda, the son of Cecil the lion has been shot on a trophy hunt by Zimbabwe PH Richard Cooke.

"The three West African countries at the heart of an Ebola epidemic recorded their first week with no new cases since the outbreak was declared in March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.
The U. N. agency said that more than 28,000 people have been infected and more than 11,000 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the world's worst known occurrence of Ebola, but there were no new cases in the week to Oct. 4.
New cases of Ebola have dwindled sharply this year but the WHO said there was still a risk of the disease breaking out again.
""Over 500 contacts remain under follow-up in Guinea, and several high-risk contacts associated with active and recently active chains of transmission in Guinea and Sierra Leone have been lost to follow-up,"" it said in its situation report.
Sierra Leone released its last known Ebola patients on Sept. 28 and must wait 42 days until it can be declared free of the disease.
Liberia received that declaration for a second time on Sept. 3 after a flare-up in June but remains under heightened surveillance. Guinea's most recent cases were recorded on Sept. 27.",0
"Corrections and clarifications: This story has been updated to show retail industry employs 1 in 10 U. S. workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Amazon announced Thursday it plans to add 30,000 part-time positions in the U. S. over the next year, part of a massive hiring binge by the online retailing giant.
The part-time hiring includes 5,000 jobs in Virtual Customer Service, which would allow employees to work as a customer service agent from home. The remaining 25,000 would be at Amazon warehouses. Any part-time employees who work 20 hours or more a week are also eligible for benefits.
""There are lots of people who want or need a flexible job — whether they’re a military spouse, a college student, or a parent — and we’re happy to empower these talented people no matter where they happen to live,” said Tom Weiland, Amazon's vice president for worldwide customer service, in a statement.
The part-time plan is part of a larger hiring spree by Amazon. In January, the company said it would add 100,000 full-time jobs in the U. S. with full benefits over the next 18 months. Most positions will be filled at fulfillment centers and in new fields including cloud technology and machine learning.
Amazon has bolstered its workforce over the last several years. In 2011, Amazon had more than 56,000 full- and part-time employees. By the end of its 2016 fiscal year, that number swelled to more than 341,000.
Amazon's rapid growth has had a huge impact on the retail industry, whichaccounts for 1 in every 10workers in the U. S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Concerns have also been raised about the quality of job prospective employees will earn when hired by Amazon. The company has faced complaints and lawsuits tied to working conditions and low wages. In a statement to USA TODAY in January, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman defended Amazon's culture, saying they are ""proud of the work environment and the culture we have.""",0
"Millionaires are planning to spend generously, but not extravagantly, this holiday season.
According to a new survey, most millionaires expect to spend between $1,000 and $2,500 on holiday gifts this year, though some multimillionaires plan to spend a whopping $25,000 or more.
While those numbers may sound high — particularly to those who are shopping on a budget — don't expect them to provide a major boost to overall holiday sales growth.
The New GOP Favorite of the Rich: CNBC Survey
The CNBC Millionaire Survey, which polled 750 people with $1 million or more in investible assets, found the vast majority (81 percent) will spend the same amount this year as they did in 2014. Ten percent said they would spend more, while 9 percent plan to spend less.
""Given the level of the markets this year and the overall positive state of the economy, one would have thought that spending would increase somewhat this year,"" said George Walper, president of Spectrem Group, which conducted the survey. ""Once the economy stabilized a few years ago, it seems as if millionaires have a set targeted amount they would like to spend and hold to it.""
The largest group of respondents, 33 percent, said they plan to spend between $1,000 and $2,499 on gifts this season. One in four plans to spend between $2,500 and $4,999, while 16 percent plan to spend $5,000 or more. That includes 5 percent who plan to spend $10,000 or more.
Among multimillionaires, or those worth $5 million or more, most plan to spend more than $2,500, with 11 percent planning to spend $10,000 or more.
Millionaires plan to spend the most on their families, particularly on their kids and grandkids. Thirty-six percent plan to spend the most on their children, while 22 percent said they'd shell out the most on their grandchildren.
Only 16 percent plan to spend the most on their spouse, while 3 percent plan to spend the most on themselves.",0
"Hurricane Maria roared toward eastern Puerto Rico early Wednesday as the most powerful storm to threaten the region in almost 90 years.
Maria was a Category 5 hurricane — the strongest there is — when it killed one person and injured two others as it hit the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe on Monday night. ""Widespread devastation"" was also reported on Dominica.
At 5 a.m. ET Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said Maria's eye was expected to make a landfall in Puerto Rico in ""a couple of hours."" Its maximum sustained winds were at 155 mph as it churned about 15 miles from Vieques, an island off Puerto Rico's eastern coast, and about 50 miles southeast of San Juan.
The center's bulletin added that tropical storm and hurricane conditions were already occurring over the Virgin Islands and spreading over Puerto Rico.
The storm weakened to Category 4 early Wednesday, and was expected to maintain that intensity until it makes landfall.
As far as destruction is concerned, the distinction between the two strongest categories is immaterial, said Orelon Sidney, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel, who said, ""Whatever a 5 can do, a 4 can do.""
""Locations may be uninhabitable for weeks or months,"" the National Hurricane Center warned.
The storm is expected to bring up to 16 inches of rain to the U. S. and British Virgin Islands and up to 25 inches to Puerto Rico, causing life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. The islands could also see several tornadoes throughout Wednesday.
Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told reporters Tuesday that Maria ""promises to be much more devastating"" than was Hurricane Irma, which killed at least 70 people as it plowed through the Caribbean and the Southeastern United States earlier this month.
""If you are in a flood zone, your life is in danger,"" Rosselló said. ""If you are in a wooden house, your life is in danger.""
Héctor Pesquera, Puerto Rico's commissioner of public safety, was even more blunt.
""You have to evacuate — otherwise, you are going to die,"" he said, according to Telemundo, NBC's Spanish-language network. ""I do not know how to make this any clearer.""
Early Wednesday, Rosselló tweeted that more than 11,000 people and nearly 600 pets were waiting out Maria in 500 shelters.
Some who chose to flee Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands ahead of Maria arrived at airports in Florida Tuesday, APTN reported.
""I live on St. John and we were there for Irma when Irma came through and she just basically devastated the island,"" said Patrick Coffey, a resident of the U. S. Virgin Islands. ""A lot of people lost everything and then it was just time for us to get off, we didn't want to stay for Maria.""
Louis Santos, who flew to Florida from Puerto Rico, said he still remembers dealing with the devastating effects of Hurricane Georges that hit the island in 1998.
""This time it's going to be worse,"" Santos said. ""It's going to be a Category 5. That, back then, was a Category 3.""
President Donald Trump has declared states of emergency in both territories, and the Coast Guard has moved all its ships, aircraft and personnel out of harm's way so they can quickly launch rescue missions once the storm passes, officials said.
Hurricane warnings also went up in the Dominican Republic from Cabo Engano to Puerto Plata. Maria was expected to skirt just north of the Dominican Republic on Wednesday night and Thursday, according to forecasters.
The last time the region was threatened by a storm this powerful was in 1928, when the Okeechobee Hurricane roared through the Virgin Islands and slammed Puerto Rico. It killed more than 300 people there and left a trail of destruction from one end of the island to the other before heading on to Florida.
In the end, it wound up being one of the deadliest hurricanes on record to hit North America, killing more than 4,000 people — most of them poor black residents who lived near Lake Okeechobee in South Florida and whose bodies were buried in mass graves.
But back then, Puerto Rico had a population of less than 1.5 million and was largely rural. Today, the population is nearly 3.5 million. And it's still feeling the effects of Irma, which at its worst point cut off power to more than 1 million people.
With several days to prepare, many Puerto Ricans stocked up on supplies, boarded up their homes and headed once again for shelters and higher ground.
Morales, 48, the mother of two children, said she would ride out the storm with her parents and brother at a home in Rio Piedras.
""Everybody's tense. The streets are a little crazy now,"" she said. ""The streetlights aren't working. Gas stations — the ones that do have gas, the lines — are incredible. People are like a little bit crazy, panicked.""
Maria roared through Dominica and Guadeloupe overnight. One person was killed by a falling tree on Guadeloupe and two other people were still missing after a boat disappeared off the coast, authorities said.
In Dominica, the 72,000 or so residents were digging out after the storm.
""Initial reports are of widespread devastation,"" Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit reported on his Facebook page. ""So far we have lost all what money can buy and replace.""
Skerrit reported Monday night that he'd had to be rescued from his own home, the roof of which was blown off.
""Dominica had very little time to prepare for this monster... the strongest storm of their lifetimes,"" said NBC News meteorologist Bill Karins, who highlighted that Maria was one of the fastest-growing hurricanes ever recorded.
The French island of Martinique, which at one point appeared poised to take a direct hit from Maria, also sustained heavy damage, authorities said.
It's only the second time in recorded history that two Category 5 hurricanes have made landfall in a hurricane season, Karins said. The last time that happened in the Atlantic basin was in 2007, when Dean and Felix killed 174 people in Mexico and Central America. They were so destructive that both of their names were retired.",0
"An interesting thing happened along the way to insolvency for major banks dependent more upon zero interest rate borrowing from the Fed than from everyday depositors. And that being, the banks now desperately want your money and are willing to pay for it.
Within the past few weeks, both Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are offering between 1-5% yields for simple savings accounts when for the past seven years depositors were not only receiving less than 1%, but the days of free checking were now long over.
Open a term account and get 5% gross annual Deutsche Bank will always offer the best offer on the market. Therefore, you can now 3 months 5% gross annualized receive when you open a DB Invest Plus deposit account.
An excellent opportunity to increase your returns
Deutsche Bank, you may be demanding for money. Proof? Stop by one of our Financial Centers. You now get a clear 3 months 5% gross per annum for new amounts from 10,000 to 50,000 euros, if you go for June 24, 2016 opens a DB Invest Plus deposit account (subject to early closing).
Please note that this promotion is only valid for the injection of fresh money, ie amounts previously never been in an account with Deutsche Bank AG Branch Brussels were (between 10,000 and 50,000 euros per person and per family and only at the Financial Centers Deutsche Bank AG Branch Brussels. offer reserved for Belgian residents).
You receive a guaranteed rate of 5% gross per annum for 3 months for each new deposit of 10,000 to 50,000. – Deutsche Bank
Yet while this offer by Deutsche Bank is for Belgian depositors only, a new policy change coming out of Goldman Sachs is allowing U. S. customers to open an account with only $1 dollar deposited.
Goldman Sachs has entered the online banking game, offering bank accounts that don’t require a minimum deposit to open and have a 1.04% interest rate.
The accounts don’t have any transaction fees, but customers are limited to six withdrawals or transfers in a monthly statement cycle.
Customers can sign up at GSBank.com, which launched last week.
It’s been tough for savers to find a decent interest rate in the wake of the Great Recession.
The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near record lows to help boost the economy. Lower rates make it cheaper for banks to lend money, but they also put a lid on the amount of interest consumers earn on their savings.
The average national rate on savings in the U. S. is currently 0.06%, according to the FDIC.
But online-only accounts eliminate the costs of running brick-and-mortar branches, which allows banks to offer better rates. – CNN Money
Goldman only became a commercial bank following the 2008 Credit Crisis, and until now chose only to deal with high end depositors and investment clients. But like with Deutsche Bank over in Europe, the need for new liquidity is trumping old traditions and superseding market prices when it comes to interest.
One has to seriously question however these sudden moves by Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs when they offer prime benefits to customers to put their money in these institutions. And the most important determination one must make before deciding to jump in is whether these new programs are legitimate at face value, or a deception to try to get people to deposit monies that will eventually be used in a bail-in scheme sometime down the road.

"As the Catholic Church battles to stem their continuing exposure of clerical pedophilia, detectives have uncovered an ""unprecedented"" amount of child pornography includingimages, videos and other explicit content discovered within the walls of the Vatican.
The Vatican Promotor of Justice,Gian Piero Milano, released a report in response to the allegations which he read in full to Catholic Church officials during a judicial ceremony.
Due to the Catholic Church's internal investigations protocol, Milano claims he is under no legal obligation to actually name names of people accused of pedophilia and possessing child pornography.
However, Federico Lombardi, spokesman for the Holy See, showed a rare display of openness and named Archbishop Josef Wesolowski as one of the accused that had triggered the investigation.
Although this may seem like a forthcoming gesture by the Vatican, reports ofWesolowski not onlypossessing more than 100,000 images and videos of childrenbeing forced into sex acts but also of him sexually abusing multiple children in Poland and the Dominican Republic have already previously been exposed in 2014.
Due to the Vatican's internal policies, Wesolowski was investigated but escaped jail for ""his own protection"".
In an unusual move by the church, the high-ranking Catholic official was facing trial from the Vatican's prosecution for his crimes and had been placed under ""protective"" house arrest, but mysteriously died before the case even reached a ""courtroom"".
The lack of justice following his death left many of his victims frustrated with suggestions that the only reason for the house arrest is the fact that word got out that he was allowed to roam free after he was quietly whisked away from the Dominican Republic and back to the Catholic city-state by Vatican officials in order to avoid prosecution there.
According to Church and State, the descriptions of what was actually found on Wesolowski’s computer were more than a little stomach-churning:
There were more than 160 videos of teenaged boys being forced to masturbate for the camera and perform sex acts on one another.
In addition, the boys were raped and forced to perform sex acts on adults, as well.
Wesolowski was tedious and protective of his child porn collection, filing more than 86,000 images into categories in locked folders.
In addition to the images and videos present on the computer, at least 45,000 others had already been deleted.
Further, the good Archbishop wanted to make sure he wasn’t without a stash of child porn while traveling, so he took a laptop along on his trips containing, even more, images and videos.
It seems fairly typical that the only accused party to be named in this latest child porn discovery case in the one that has already been exposed and passed away, with the identities of the other accused kept confidential.
According to the Guardian, beyond the child pornography cases, Vatican authorities are battling an array of crimes including drug trafficking and money laundering.
Three drug deliveries addressed to the Vatican were intercepted in 2014, including apacket containing cocaine-filled condoms.
The drugs were discovered at Germany’s Leipzig airport and handed to the Vatican in the hope of ensnaring the buyer, but no one came forward to claim the package.
Despite the array of criminal activity, only six people ended up in the Vatican’s prison in recent years.
They include Marcello di Finizio, an Italian protester who climbed atop St Peter’s Basilica, and Iana Azhdanova, a Femen activist who bared her breasts andgrabbed a baby Jesus statuefrom the Vatican’s nativity scene.",1
"Israel has approved plans for the construction of over 8,000 new homes in the West Bank, with over a third for set for “immediate” construction.
According to the Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, 3,651 settlements were approved last week.
The planned expansion of illegal Jewish settlements will make it the largest in a quarter of a century.
Plans for 8,345 new housing units have been approved by the Israeli authorities so far this year, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency writes, citing Liebermann. Out of these, 3,066 have been given final approval and will soon be built.
“The numbers for the first half of 2017 are the highest since 1992,” Lieberman said, as cited by local media and news agencies.
The defense minister also praised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government for its aggressive stance on expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
“There was no better government in terms of settlement construction,” he said, according to Haaretz.
For some, however, the plans appear to fall short of expectations.
“I respect the defense minister very much but unfortunately the numbers he mentioned aren’t correct,” Yossi Dagan, the head of the Samaria Regional Council, said, according to the newspaper. According to Dagan, most of the approved units “are counted five or six times,” essentially putting the “real number” under 2,000 housing units.
However, according to Lieberman, pushing for more would “stretch the rope beyond its limit, and thus put the entire settlement enterprise at risk.”
Nearly 400,000 Jewish settlers are estimated to be living in the West Bank along with 2.8 million Palestinians. Another 200,000 Israelis live in East Jerusalem, an area claimed by Palestinians.
The construction of settlements in the region is considered illegal under international law. The international community has long voiced concerns over the controversial constructions while condemning the deteriorating security situation between Israelis and Palestinians.
The government of Israel stopped building official settlements in 1992, according to Israeli monitoring group Peace Now. That, however, did not stop the construction of unauthorized settlements in the West Bank.",1
"Those are all very true and good, but the purpose of Investing Taxes into Schools was to get an education, not babysit, not create fodder for drug pushers, not damage the egos of young people, which means since we have over 300,000,000, (million,) people in this country, we should be able to find some able bodied talented Teachers who can relate to a classroom of 35 or more students at one time and still give them the opportunity to learn something useful.
Education shouldn’t be a footrace to see what teacher can cover the most material in a semester, or a politicalparty that indoctrinates students in Islam. It cheapens the experience and tends to showcase the best and brightest so local companies can step in and hire the best while the rest languish in labor pools looking for union jobs.
It’s funny how many home schoolers, Charter Schools, and Parochial Schools there are to try to get past the degenerative impact of public schools. Public Schools IMHO are just a breading ground for Military Service.
A student shouldn’t be held back because the teacher can’t connect with the student. It’s like having a football coach that can’t get through to his players.
ADA is what is used to pay for each students attendance so the middle class pays for what, exactly? Indoctrination School?
Competition can be carried too far, where students get neck, back, leg and ankle injuries at a time in their life when those injuries will hamper or prevent that student from getting jobs he would have otherwise qualified for, including military service.
IQ tests are a combination of speed visual acuity tests, (all those shapes angles and fitting things into patterns,) and an introversion/ extroversion personality tests used to hammer down the ego of those of a lessor God, and finding out who takes risks. So, those who don’t score high are condemned to be left out of the equation no matter how hard you work.
Then there is nepotism, as in “it’s who you know not what you know” that gets you the hired.
So, if you have poor eyesight, you are a bit timid, and you don’t have any connections , you’re plain out of luck. May as well just join a gang, and get it over, because they’re out of luck. Could Gang affiliation numbers represent the success/failure of public education? If that’s true then our country has failed miserably at education.
So, if what all you and I say are true, what’s the point of going through 12-18 years of education and end up not getting a job or getting a job flipping burgers? Kind of a waste of ADA isn’t it.  Throw them out into the street at a early age and let them man up, (or women up,) maybe they can make a living prostituting themselves, under the new laws.
Just make any student who scores less than the upper 30% go straight into working in the fields picking fruit, tomatoes, and peaches and knocking almonds. Oh, we gave those jobs to South and Central Americans. Just issue the euthanasia drugs if they don’t have high IQ’s, and do the world a favor before they bread, get on welfare, discover Social Security.  Or NOT!
Bill Gates got where he did, not because he was an excellent student, programmer or smart boy, but because his father was a great lawyer who took what Nerdy Bill had done, a simple 3 byte index, word drivenlanguage taken from Dartmouth Basic, put a few of his own twists on it, and patented stuff they stole from other companies, like the mouse, the Window, hardware drivers, and leveraged that into contracts where every PC manufacturer had to pay them a license fee even though it was full of holes, errors, blue screen of death when he went to “colored windows”, full of places where almost any 4 year old could hook into a jump table to place his own virus, malware, denial of service on others computers, a place to put his own code and take over the computer.
He got where he did, not because of his education, because his pop knew someone, was a lawyer, and he was in the right place at the right time to con companies out of their stuff to make his stuff and patent it.
Bill Gates must have studied Edison, who was good at doing the same kind of things.
He made his millions because of Nepotism, pure timing, and pure thievery and leveraging the law.
How many students do you know with a patent attorney for a father, and access to the best Colleges in the land based on their proximity to those colleges and companies, i.e. Silicon Valley or the Defense Industry in Redmond Washington?
How many programmers did he squelch by his license requirements?
So when you quote Bill Gates as he talks all high and mighty, it helps to know what kind of a thief he was in his formative years.
What he could have done for our society compared to what he has done for our society. Yes he is paying some of his Billionsforward, I think his wife had something to do with that. He had opportunities to turn America into a dreamland, but his bent on his world view to corner a market and create a monopoly, and to throw the dice where ever they may land and see what happens.
Not my idea of a revolutionary individual in the long and the short of it at the end of the day.
He could have prevented the current state of BLM, Muslim Brotherhood, CAIR, and a society that looks at Gang Activity as an education, an insurance policy, and and extended family who can feed off of the drug habits of those slowly killing themselves because they feel trapped.
That could have all could have changed, but didn’t, did it. He and his cronies sent all of those jobs, after firing 100’s of thousands of programmers, and technical engineers, to Hong Kong, South Korea, South Vietnam, Japan, India and Mexico to build a better 3rd world and turn American into a new 3rd World Country.
I would walk on eggs before you quote such a man with his questionable moral character.
He’s in league with Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, and even Bernard Madoff, he just got away with it.",1
"Thousands of dead seabirds have been reported as washed ashore on black rock beach in Whittier, California earlier this month.
Local biologist David Irons says he has never seen such a huge number of dead birds in such a small area before.
“We have never found close to 8,000 birds on a 1-mile long beach before,” Irons said. “It is an order of magnitude larger than any records that I am aware of.”
Biologists like Tamara Zeller have been boating around Prince William Sound scanning the beaches for dead and sickly murres. They also count the birds floating in the water, she told CNN affiliate KTVA.
They cannot stop at every beach so they estimate the disturbing total of birds from the ship. When they are able to get to shore, the toll is always much higher.
At Whittier, one day about two weeks ago, she counted 98 of the black and white birds while on the water. On shore she saw 284. The day’s total for January 7 was 3,000.
The birds, all of a species known as the common murre, appear to have starved to death, federal wildlife officials say.
Heather Renner, a supervisory biologist at the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, said the Whittier die-off is part of a much larger event that started in August.
“It’s hard to know how many birds have died because Alaska is so big, and there are so many remote areas,” Renner said.
The vast majority of the bird deaths are due to starvation. Tests on 100 carcasses revealed almost all the murres were emaciated, and the culprit is likely their lack of a good food supply.
“The fish that they eat tend to have a narrow band of water temperatures they can live in,” Irons said. “If the temperature gets too warm or too cold the fish disappear.”
And there’s plenty of warm water off Alaska’s coast right now. Since 2013, an expanse of seawater that’s 2 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit above average has stretched from Asia to North America. Scientists have dubbed it “the blob,” and they’re studying it closely for its effect on wildlife.
According to the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service, murres usually spend the winter offshore, diving into the water for fish, crustaceans and mollusks. The average adult murre weighs 2 pounds and eats up to 30% of its body weight per day.
They typically dive as deep as 250 feet, but if they need to, almost 600 feet is possible. Their short wings make them excellent swimmers.
The 8,000 dead common murres that Irons observed doesn’t put a dent in the overall population. Neither does Renner’s estimation of 100,000 bird deaths. There are approximately 2.8 million murres in Alaska.
Their deaths give clues to a larger picture, Irons said.
“Seabird biologists say seabirds are indicators of the health of the ecosystem. Now they’re dying and that is telling us something. We should be aware of that. If we don’t record they’re dying it goes unnoticed,” Irons told KTVA.
The scientists also say that die-offs aren’t uncommon. One in 1993 was estimated at 100,000 murres. There was one in 1997 — during an El Nio — that affected several types of birds. At that time scientists also focused on warm water and the lack of food.
And almost 190,000 murres perished after the Exxon Valdez crashed in the sound in 1989, spilling more than 1 million gallons of oil.
But Irons and Renner say this die-off is different in its scope and the persistence of the warm water blob that may have caused it.
“Scientists tend to get blasé about (die-offs) but this is bigger than I’ve ever seen,” Irons told KTVA.
“This is probably one of the larger events and going over a longer period of time and a bigger geographical area,” Renner said.
Murres aren’t just being found on shorelines. They also have been picked up as far inland as Denali State Park, CNN affiliate KTUU reported.
Being on land means trouble for murres, whose bodies are designed to take off from water. The inland murres are grounded and needed to be taken back to the ocean. Before that they are taken to a rehab facility.
At the Bird Treatment and Learning Center in Anchorage, staffers usually see a few sick or starving murres each year. So far this season more than 225 have been brought in.",1
"Drones owned by one of the world’s largest gold mining companies are being destroyed by native eagles, costing the company thousands of dollars.
Mining is one of the most destructive forces currently on the face of the planet. Mines, since the Industrial Era, have poisoned the environment and its workers alike. Gold mining is particularly destructive as its waste carries mercury and cyanide, which are typically used to extract gold from rock. These potent neurotoxins persist in the environment, poisoning the soil, and contaminate water supplies permanently. Gold mining also releases hundreds of tons of elemental mercury into the air annually. In addition, this type of mining is considered particularly destructive because of its wastefulness – over 20 tons of rock and soil must be “treated” and then dislodged to produce enough gold for a single ring. Recently, in the US, the toxic consequences of gold mining were on full display when the Environmental Protection Agency’s incompetence in cleaning out an abandoned gold mine turned the Animas river orange after heavy metal-laden mining waste drained into the river. Before this tragic accident, the EPA had reported that 40% of Western US watersheds had been permanently contaminated by mining.
Now that gold mining is not as common as it once was in the US, many other countries have been exploited by gold mining firms in its absence. One of these countries is Australia. Mining in Australia is a major industry with gold mining in Western Australia alone generating over $10 billion every year. However, some of the gold mines there have been experiencing a costly and unexpected problem as nature has apparently decided to fight back against its incursions. Drones that are used to survey the territory around gold mines are being destroyed by native wedge-tailed eagles. Rick Steven, a mine surveyor in the region, said that he had lost nine of his Trimble UX5 drones to eagles, which he labeled “the natural enemy” of drones. After the attacks began, Steven camouflaged his drones as baby eagles. However, the ruse only worked temporarily as 50 flights later the eagles realized the disguised drones were not what they seemed. Each of these drones costs an impressive $20,000, meaning that gold mining companies are losing money fast thanks to the eagles’ intervention. One of these companies, Gold Fields, has already lost over $100,000.
This isn’t the first case of animals fighting back against the degradation of the environment in recent months. Less than a month ago, a herd of wild buffalo appeared out of nowhere in a seeming show of support to the Native Americans and their allies protesting the Dakota Access pipeline. The buffalo, who are considered sacred by the Sioux tribe, appeared by the thousands in a stampede that interrupted a confrontation between protestors and police. After the event, many speculated that the buffalo had appeared to show their solidarity with the protestors and indicated that nature was fighting back against exploitative corporate practices. Hopefully, these acts of defiance from the natural world will inspire people to follow their lead in taking a stand against the corporations destroying the planet.

"Monsanto has agreed to pay the US government $600,000 for not reporting hundreds of uncontrolled toxic chemical releases from its Idaho phosphate plant. The releases in Soda Springs occurred between 2006 and 2009.
The plant emitted hydrogen cyanide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury into the atmosphere during that three-year span, officials from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Justice Department said in a statement. Companies are required by law to report such releases immediately.
“Each of these chemicals are hazardous and can pose serious health risks to workers and the community if mishandled or released in an uncontrolled manner,” the federal statement said.
The Soda Springs facilities are operated by P4 Production LLC, a wholly owned Monsanto subsidiary. The company said it reconciled differences with the EPA, some as early as 2009, and received the EPA’s violation notice in May 2011.
The company came into compliance by reporting the releases that continue to occur. But instead of reporting on a daily basis, Monsanto obtained a type of continuing release report, good for a year, according to Suzanne Powers, a compliance officer with the EPA, as reported by AP.
Monsanto said in a statement that none of the releases exceeded federal or state laws, and that the federal government was not accusing them of going beyond its standards.
“The protection of our employees, public health and the environment is always our No. 1 priority,” said Roger Gibson, P4’s vice president of operations. “As a long-time neighbor within the Soda Springs community, we care deeply about public health and the quality of our air, land and water, and we are committed to complying fully and transparently with all applicable laws and regulations.”
Several of the chemicals released in Soda Springs aren’t considered priority pollutants, EPA spokesman Mark MacIntyre said.
“They fall through the crack a little bit in terms of the Clean Air Act and how they’re regulated,” Powers noted.
The southeastern Idaho plant has processed phosphate ore since 1952. Monsanto refines the ore mined by several companies. Phosphorus is used in the company’s Roundup herbicides, as well as in fire retardants and aviation fluids.
“Monsanto is committed to mining in an environmentally responsible and sensitive way. Soda Springs has and will continue to go above and beyond legal requirements for responsible mining,” the company said on its website. “We want to minimize environmental impacts, and we want to ensure the land is responsibly restored after mining has ceased. This includes planting flowers, grasses and shrubs, as well as constructing habitats to encourage wildlife to return to the land.”
In 2011, P4 agreed to pay a $1.4 million civil penalty for Clean Water Act violations at its South Rasmussen Mine near Soda Springs. In addition to the penalty, P4 said it would spend an estimated $875,000 on monitoring and to prevent pollutants from entering local waters.
The $600,000 fine is a slap on the wrist for a company that earned nearly $1.5 billion in profits during fiscal year 2013.",1
"The new Hollywood blockbuster “Noah” has created a tremendous amount of interest in the story of Noah’s Ark. Traditionally, most people have regarded it as just a cute Bible story to tell children. But could it be real? Is there solid evidence that Noah’s Ark actually existed? If there is real evidence, would you believe it? What you are about to see is absolutely stunning. In fact, some of the things that you are about to see are so shocking that many people will simply refuse to accept them. Later in this article, you are going to see video footage of the physical remains of Noah’s Ark. This discovery has been known about for quite some time, but the mainstream media has mostly ignored it. A boat-shaped object that is the exact length that the Ark should be and the exact width the Ark should be has been found on the mountains of Ararat. Ground penetrating radar shows us how the Ark was laid out, and scientific tests have been conducted on wood and metal extracted from the gigantic buried boat. If you have never heard about any of this before, prepare to be blown away. The following are 14 cold, hard facts about Noah’s Ark that you probably do not know…
#1 The Ark was about 500 feet long. That would make it approximately the size of a World War II aircraft carrier.
#2 It has been estimated that the Ark had an internal volume of more than 1.5 million cubic feet.
#3 According to brand new research conducted by scientists the University of Leicester, Noah’s Ark could have carried at least 70,000 animals without sinking…
Noah’s Ark would have floated even with two of every animal in the world packed inside, scientists have calculated.
Although researchers are unsure if all the creatures could have squeezed into the huge boat, they are confident it would have handled the weight of 70,000 creatures without sinking.
#4 Of course the Ark would not have needed to hold 70,000 animals. One conservative estimate puts the number of animals on the Ark at about 16,000. This would have allowed for more than enough room for food, supplies and lots of empty space.
#5 We have discovered at least 250 different ancient cultures that have a story of a massive, cataclysmic flood. Most of those stories have striking similarities to the Genesis account.
#6 If there really was a global flood, we would expect to find billions of dead things laid down in rock layers all over the globe. And that is precisely what we find.
#7 We know where Noah’s Ark is today. Yes, you read that correctly. As you can see from theYouTube video posted below, the remains of Noah’s Ark have been discovered on “the mountains of Ararat” in Turkey. This video footage is absolutely stunning…
#8 The remains of the Ark are just as long and just as wide as the Bible says they should be.
#9 Wood from the Ark has been tested, and the tests show that it does contain organic carbon. That means that the fossilized wood that was discovered was once living matter.
#10 Along with wood, metal was also used in the construction of the Ark. Iron fittings and aluminum have both been discovered at the remains of the Ark.
#11 Petrified animal dung, a petrified antler and and an ancient piece of cat hair have also been retrieved from the remains of the Ark.
#12 Historical records confirm that people have believed that this is the correct resting place of the Ark for a very, very long time…
The Gilgamesh Epic (650 BC) gives Mt. Nisir as the landing place of the Ark. The local name for the town where the Ark was found is Nasar.
The annals of Ashurnasurpal II of Assyria (833-859 BC) places it south of the Zab river (correct).
Theophilus of Antioch (115-185 AD) said the Ark could be seen in his day in the Arabian mountains. Later Church Fathers also mention the Ark as late as the mid 7th century.
In the 13th century, Willam, a traveler, stated for the first time that Mt. Masis was the Ark location (present-day Mt. Ararat).
Ptolemy’s Geographia (1548) mentions the mountains of Armenia as the place of landing. So does the traveler Nicolas de Nicolay (1558).
#13 A village near the remains of the Ark is known as “the Village of Eight”, and a nearby valley is known as “the Valley of the Eight”. There were eight survivors on the Ark.
#14 The site is now known as “the National Park of Noah’s Ark” and it has previously been officially recognized by the Turkish government.

When I was young, I desperately hoped that Noah’s Ark would be found someday, but I doubted that it would ever happen.
Well, it has happened.
It is not just a story for little children.
So will you believe the evidence, or will you just dismiss it because it does not fit with your current worldview?",1

"This amazing discovery would be incredible and historic enough just by virtue of the fact of its being that Queen Nefertiti fled with a small band of followers and escaped her husband’s fate at the hands of the corrupt Amun Priesthood.
But this historic find has even more secrets to reveal. The early testing of the artifacts reveals the extraordinary data that carbon dating tests put the age of the artifacts at approximately 12,000 BC, which throws a completely new light on the age of royal lineage of the Amarna ruling family.
The biggest and most evocative discovery in the history of archeology is definitely finding Tutankhamen’s tomb. Since then it is said that all the greatest treasures were discovered, and that no further significant discovery had not. Yet constantly whispers about the mysterious discoveries that are concealed from the public. It is not only strange space under the pyramids and the Sphinx, the mysterious scrolls described nenznámm letters, but sometimes even the appearance at first sight ,, ordinary tomb, whose real importance is concealed before populations.
One of these is the grave known as KV 55. It was discovered in 1907 by archaeologist Dr. Edward Ayrton. The unfinished tomb was evident in the past damaged by flooding, evidence that the battered cartridge inside the tomb. Experts attributed the earliest tomb of Queen Tiye, the wife of Pharaoh Amenhotep III., Because the mummy seemed feminine traits. However, once they compared the external features statues of Akhenaten,
concluded that the mummy belongs to this king, which are said to be suffering from illnesses dystrophia adiposgenitalis that causes men that they do not develop internal and external genital organs. But then came another theory that there was in fact a mummy Smenchkareho. But before anyone could examine the correctness of this assertion, mummy mysteriously disappeared. At seventy years.
Smenkhkare
In 2000 he gave clues about the rediscovery of the mummies Berlin Egyptologist Dr. Krauss, who accused the professor and his wife Wildung of harboring stolen items. He also claimed that since 1971 has been lost mummy kept in the Museum of Egyptology at Munich, where he allegedly got neznámi channels. So when the mummy was found again, the experts decided to perform various measurements and analyzes and tests blood group.
It emerged that the mummy considered Smenchkareho was a brother or half-brother Tutankhamun. However, since the experts wanted to be absolutely sure, made with Japanese universities agreement on DNA tests. Before such tests occurred, we were exploring suddenly stopped. Why? That nobody knows. The survey sarcophagus, however, reportedly showed that Smenkhkare could be identical with the biblical brother of Moses – Aaron.
The tomb of Akhenaten and Nefertiti
Akhenaten and Nefertiti
A kind of archaeologist walked a few weeks around the dam Nasser and one day he noticed the stone block, which measured 60 cm. Immediately afterwards he discovered that behind it lies the entrance to the stairs, heading for the tomb. Signs indicated that this is the tomb of Akhenaten and Nefertiti. It was clear that this is the greatest discovery since the opening of the tomb of Tutankhamen. But what happened? Egyptology her team on 27 March 1997 and then opened without any justification uzavel. Opět again the question arises, why? The interior of the tomb ptozkoumali experts from the British Museum and apparently reached an incredible discoveries. In the tomb they found statues 8500-12 000 years old, so the question arose whether it was Akhenaten’s government did not move in the earlier period.
However, historians have responded promptly and justify the finding follows the old statues that have not necessarily come from the time of Akhenaton, the pharaoh in a tomb located just old statues. Proverbs yet another blow. For some circumstantial evidence in the tomb of experts reached that Akhenaten was the same with Moses (Smenkhkare would therefore be his brother – Aaron, as already mentioned.) Such information could but could not get the public because it shook the huge number of population and demolished the foundations of world religions. Therefore, this discovery was kept secret from the people.",1

Earl “Rusty” Powell has decided to retire after 25 years at the helm of the National Gallery of Art. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  National Gallery of Art Director Earl “Rusty” Powell, whose tenure has been marked by the collection’s growth, the renovation of nearly every space and a startling lack of controversy, will retire in early 2019 after more than 25 years in charge.  Powell, 74, planned to tell the National Gallery’s staff Tuesday during informal meetings. Next year, the trustees will begin the process of finding a successor for the longest-serving director in its 76-year history. “I think I have run a pretty good race here, and it seems sort of a logical time,” Powell said in explaining the decision. “I turn 75 next year. And this will be after that. I still have some gas in the tank. I’m not particularly interested in sitting on the porch looking at sunsets.” What he’ll do, he said, is not clear. But what he has accomplished at the National Gallery is easy to chart. Over Powell’s tenure, the institution, with a $200million operating budget and 5million visitors a year, has been reshaped, from the addition of a sculpture garden in 1999 to the dramatic renovation of the East Building, completed last year to add stunning galleries devoted to Mark Rothko and to Barnett Newman’s “Stations of the Cross.” Powell has also overseen projects less buzzworthy but just as essential.

(National Gallery of Art, Gallery Archives)  Six years and $19.3million were spent renovating more than three acres of leaky skylights in the West Building, part of a deferred maintenance disaster once considered so dire it inspired a local TV news series titled “Gallery of Shame.”  Powell’s tenure has also been notable for something it lacked: controversy. “He’s had that balance between being able to make decisions and yet not offend everybody,” said John Wilmerding, the former National Gallery deputy director who later served as chairman of its board of trustees. Powell would never use words such as “consummate leadership,” as his supporters do, to describe himself. He can be witty, have strong opinions, but these often come as asides, spoken softly and without naming names. He is not one to call out other museum directors, even though he does note that he doesn’t agree with everyone in the field. About what? With whom? He won’t say.  This is in contrast with J. Carter Brown, the blue-eyed impresario he replaced in 1992. Brown loved blockbusters, mingling with royals — he brought Prince Charles and Princess Diana to the National Gallery in 1985 — and tended to spend less time on issues such as infrastructure.  Wilmerding remembered that when Powell started, he noticed a stiffness when Powell had to speak in front of groups. “He relied too much on his notes,” Wilmerding said. “I remember saying to him, ‘You’ve got the personality — do more. Wing it. Tell jokes. Be yourself.’ That awkwardness rapidly began to change.” Born in South Carolina, Powell was just 4 when his father died of injuries sustained during World War II. The family moved to Rhode Island, and his mother eventually remarried. Powell went to Williams College, where he played linebacker and, after struggling to conquer chemistry class, found himself studying art history. As a boy, he had fond memories of hanging around his grandfather’s lithography business. In college, he found inspiration in S.Lane Faison Jr., a legendary professor who would help train many members of the “Williams mafia,” a group of graduates that included future museum directors Glenn D. Lowry of the Museum of Modern Art; James Wood of the Art Institute of Chicago; and Powell’s onetime roommate, John Lane, who led the Dallas Museum of Art and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Other Williams graduates to become directors include Michael Govan of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Joseph Thompson of the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. Powell credits his next stop — three years in the Navy, from 1966 to 1969 — with helping him develop the skills to become a leader. Lane also went from Williams to the Navy. The time served helped them step into directorships while only in their mid-30s. “We had already had the happy burden of being responsible for a huge piece of machinery and a lot of fellow shipmates,” Lane said. “And in what were particularly dangerous circumstances. You were well equipped to take on responsibility.” The service also, unexpectedly, led Powell to Harvard. One afternoon, Powell stopped by the art history department at Harvard to ask for a course catalogue. Professor Seymour Slive, a World War II veteran, noticed he was wearing his Navy whites, struck up a conversation, and then urged him to attend graduate school in Cambridge. This started a long list of opportunities that opened up for Powell, who noted that “I’ve never had to apply for a job.” In 1976, not long after Powell earned his PhD, Brown hired him for his first stint at the National Gallery as a curator and special assistant. And in 1980, Powell took his first trip to California to interview for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s top job. At 36, he began a 12-year tenure marked by tremendous growth, with the museum’s budget jumping from $8.5million to $31million and attendance more than doubling to close to a million visitors a year.

(National Gallery of Art, Gallery Archives)  Comedian Steve Martin, who served on the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s board of trustees, marveled at Powell’s ability to embrace a wide range of art, his cordial nature and his ability to understand how to manage the many perspectives on the board. What’s more, Martin found it notable that Powell’s tenure was conflict-free. “I never heard anybody say an unkind word about him,” said Martin, an art collector. Powell, when asked about his leadership style, gives credit to others — curators, other administrators, staff — for making him feel comfortable delegating authority. He uses email but says many of his meetings are informal, taking place as he walks from his car to his office in the morning. “I’ve always believed in a collegial, organizational structure,” he said. “I think communication is a really important thing. I learned to look at the big things. Not get bogged down with the little things. We make collective decisions about most of the things we do here. Our exhibitions program. It’s not ‘Rusty says we’ll do this, we’ll do that.’ We talk about it. We meet and discuss things rather than do things from the top of it.” Powell can be so understated, it’s hard to know when he’s asking for anything. Even millions. That’s what longtime board president Victoria Sant found when the National Gallery was raising money for the renovation of the East Building.    Powell and Mark Leithauser view the model of the Sculpture Galleries, c. 2000. (Dennis Brack/Black Star/National Gallery of Art, Gallery Archives)  “You sort of don’t know when Rusty’s put the touch on you,” she said. “He’s not an aggressive fundraiser. He tries to bring things to people that they want, that was in their interest area. And I think one of the things that Rusty has stressed is that when you give a gift to the National Gallery, you’re really giving a gift to the nation.” Sant and her husband, Roger, ultimately gave $10million to the East Building project, which added more than 12,000 square feet of gallery space and an outdoor sculpture terrace overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue.  [The National Gallery celebrates 75 years, thanks to old-fashioned philanthropy]  That was just one of the most recent accomplishments during Powell’s tenure. The list of art acquisitions, exhibitions and building projects that have taken place since 1992 runs for pages, from the construction of Dutch cabinet galleries in 1995 to the endowment campaign launched last year after a $30million matching grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Powell’s announcement means there will no longer be a director who spent time with Paul Mellon, the late philanthropist who stood next to President Franklin D. Roosevelt when the family’s money and art collection sparked the National Gallery’s opening in 1941. It was in Powell’s first week as director that Mellon invited him for lunch. Later, the philanthropist shared his passion for a proposed sculpture garden. Powell remembers showing Mellon the plans.  “We’re going to have them as big as we can get them,” Powell said. “Good, because I don’t have that much time left and I’d really like to see this,” Mellon said. “Mr. Mellon, we’re not going to give you a starter kit for the sculpture garden,” Powell said. The garden, in fact, opened in May 1999, four months after Mellon’s death at the age of 91.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)  Powell said he never considered leaving the National Gallery, even when headhunting firms called to see whether he might be interested in other jobs. (Powell’s total compensation was comparable to those at other major institutions. He earned $1.17million in the most recent public filing available, compared with the $1.44million earned by then-Met Director Thomas Campbell.) He appreciated not having to spend so much time trying to raise money, as is the case when you’re running the Metropolitan Museum of Art or Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts. Nearly three-quarters of the National Gallery’s $200million annual operating budget comes from the federal government. He also feels a deep connection to the District. “If you do what I do, it’s the best job in the field,” he said. “The standards are very high. The collections are exemplary. The programs are great. You’re not out with a tin cup raising money to keep the building open. The federal funding obligations are to keep it maintained. It’s got a center for advanced study. I came out of the academic side, and this is the most academic place that can exist. It’s a unique place in the context of American museums.”",0
"Everywhere you go at this year’s Frankfurt Motor Show, the word ""electric"" keeps popping up. It wasn’t all that long ago that industry officials were quick to disparage battery power. Too expensive, they argued. Not enough range. Charging times that consumers wouldn’t tolerate. But this year, manufacturers are singing from a different hymn book entirely.
Just two months ago, Swedish automaker Volvo grabbed worldwide headlines when it revealed it would switch to an all-electrified strategy with every new model introduced in 2018 and beyond.
And since then, it seems, virtually every major automaker has announced plans to rapidly expand their own hybrid, plug-in and BEV plans, if not switch to electrified models entirely, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover among those making such announcements over just the last two weeks.
Much of the credit — or blame, if you prefer — for the sudden increase can be assigned to increasingly stiff government fuel economy and emissions mandates. Ironically, the U. S. seemed to be leading the charge, at least until President Donald Trump's administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider the stiff, 54.5 mile per gallon mileage mandate the Obama White House had put in place for 2025.
But even if the EPA does roll the standard back, as is widely expected, “We intend to go forward with our current plans,” Carlos Ghosn, the CEO of the Euro-Asian Renault-Nissan Alliance told NBC News.
That’s because other governments are stepping in, ready to assume the leading role the U. S. is abandoning. Norway and India have already laid out plans to entirely ban the sale of vehicles using gas and diesel power over the course of the coming decade, and France, Britain and even Germany, home of the high-speed Autobahn, are expected to follow.
Then there’s China, the world’s largest automotive market. More than a dozen of its largest cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, already limit the number of new vehicles that can be registered each month. But qualified zero-emission vehicles are exempt. On a national level, Chinese regulators have already mandated that 20 percent of all new vehicles use plug-in or pure BEV drivelines by 2025.
Over the weekend, the government signaled it was ready to go a significant step further in a bid to address the country’s choking air pollution problem. “Some countries have made a timeline for when to stop the production and sales of traditional fuel cars,” noted Xin Guobin, China’s vice minister of Industry and Information Technology. “The ministry has also started relevant research and will make such a timeline with relevant departments,” he said at an industry event on Saturday.
It is, of course, one thing to mandate a switch to electric propulsion. It’s another matter entirely determining whether consumers will accept such a shift. In a conversation after Monday evening’s news conference in Frankfurt, Volkswagen CEO Matthias Müller admitted he was clearly worried about whether shoppers will buy in. “The customer has yet to be convinced that this technology is a very good one.”
But Müller outlined his own company’s plans to “electrify every model in our range” by 2030. And that switch could come even faster, he told NBC News, if consumer demand increases quickly enough.
One year ago, during a news conference at the Paris Motor Show, Dieter Zetsche, CEO of Daimler, announced that the automaker would launch an all-new sub-brand, called Mercedes-EQ, specifically for electrified vehicles. At the time, he promised there would be 10 BEVs within a half-decade. But on Monday, Zetsche revealed plans to go significantly further.
“By 2022, we will have electrified our entire vehicle line-up, offering our customers at least one electrified version of every one of our vehicles,” he said, referring to a total of more than 50 hybrids, plug-ins and BEVs overall. “By the end of the decade, we will switch the Smart brand in Europe and the U. S. completely to electric drive, and the rest of the world will follow.""

Battery propulsion has made major strides since the first Toyota Prius debuted nearly a quarter-century ago, and especially since the Chevrolet Volt plug-in and Nissan Leaf battery-electric model launched almost simultaneously in 2010.
Back then, BEV models struggled to deliver close to 100 miles between charges. Today, Tesla’s Model S p100D tops 300 miles, and several manufacturers are promising to push into the 400-mile range by decade’s end.
And then there’s cost. When the Volt and Leaf launched, manufacturers were paying about $1,000 a kilowatt-hour for their battery packs. General Motors’ global product development chief Mark Reuss confirmed to NBC News that the new Bolt’s battery costs less than $150. At 60 kWh, that means a savings of $51,000 per vehicle. Insiders hint Nissan’s goal is to drive the price of its battery pack down to under $100 before the end of the lifecycle for the all-new version of the Leaf debuting in 2018 – that model almost doubling the range of the original battery-car with the optional battery-pack it will start offering next year.
Charging remains perhaps the most difficult challenge. But times are coming down, with fast-charging systems able to give a battery an 80 percent top-off in as little as 30 minutes, rather than 8 to 10 hours or more.
And even bigger improvements now appear to be within sight. Toyota is hinting of a major battery breakthrough for the all-new BEV it will launch in 2021. That is expected to be a so-called solid-state technology that would deliver the sort of dramatic improvements seen when automakers previously switched from nickel-metal hydride to lithium-ion chemistry. Among other things, experts are talking about charge times that could match what it currently takes to fill up a gas tank.
Automakers will need some dramatic breakthroughs. For all their promise, electrified vehicles have yet to charge up the market. Americans bought just 159,620 plug-based vehicles in 2016. And even when adding in conventional hybrids like the Prius, that added up to barely 3 percent of the 17 million new vehicles sold in the U. S. in 2016. China did a little better, with sales of 336,000 plug models, a 50 percent increase over 2015.

“These are bold steps, white-knuckle moves,” said analyst Joe Phillippi, of AutoTrends Consulting. Considering German makers alone are committing to spend about $20 billion to support their electrification plans over the next five years. Automakers, he warned, are “going to need to generate a significant return on their investment.”
But there are signs that we may be reaching the proverbial tipping point. With the launch of its new mainstream Model 3 sedan, Tesla alone hopes to sell 500,000 battery-cars in 2018, more than triple the entire U. S. market for plug-ins and BEVs combined last year.
“Tesla has made it cool to own an electric vehicle,” said Phillippi, adding that other automakers will now have to show that their battery cars can be just as exciting.",0
"Soon after William N. Finley IV got off the bus to the festival grounds late Thursday afternoon, he realized something was very wrong. He’d flown into the Bahamas for the Fyre Festival, a luxury getaway ostensibly filled withcelebrities, yachts, and villas on a pristine beach in an island paradise. Little ofthat promise was in sight, though. He did spot festival organizer Billy McFarland, atop a platform surrounded by confused attendees. No one knew what to do. The crowd was told to claim shelters, so they rushed nearby to what attendees have described as a city of disaster relief tents.
It was near dusk, so Finleywent out in search of his luggage, which had arrived separately. As night fell on Great Exuma island, hestumbled into a gaggle of festival-goerswho were unloading bags from a big red shipping container. They searched fortheir suitcases with phone flashlights.
“At that point we were like, this is not what I signed up for,” said the 32-year-old, who has become a minor celebrity in his own right under his assumed name, feeding media accounts aboutthe slow-motion fiasco. (His real name is Seth Crossno, a writer from North Carolina). Continuing the tale, Crossnosaid he eventually found food ina tent resemblinga summer camp mess hall.There were sandwiches, pasta salad, chicken dinners, and some fruit—not terrible, though he did shell outclose to$4,000 for it as part of his package. And his ticket wasa bargain compared with VIP slotsthat ran to five-figures for the promise of absolute decadence.
What was supposed to be an idyllic music festival, one to surpass those California desert gatherings,turned into chaos as attendees struggled withsubstandard conditions, lack of accommodation, and broken promises. But behind the scenes, there was a different kind of chaos. In interviews with Bloomberg, people with knowledge of how the festival was managed described an event doomedby gross mismanagement, logistical failures, and last-minute contingencies despite a year ofplanning—allegations echoed in a class action lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles, one which included Crossno’s Twitter posts sent live fromthe calamity.
Fred Porro, anexecutive at sports and entertainment marketing agency Wasserman, said holding a festival in a unique venue—one where it hasn’t been done before—requires extra time, planning, and an experienced team. A veteran ofbrand events at concerts such as Live 8 and Live Earth, Porrosaid sustainability and compliance consultants are usually brought in to make sure all timelines are met.
“In anything that we’re planning, I would never have provided responsibilities to those who are not up for the job,” he said.
From the food to security, nothing went right at Fyre Festival.
Promotion for theevent started in December, when a close-upof bikini-clad models(from behind)first appeared on the Fyre Festival Instagram page. In an investor pitch deck obtained by Vanity Fair, Fyre focused on celebrity “influencers,” dubbed “Fyre Starters.” One slide reproduced by the article asked: “What if we reimagined what it means to attend a music festival?” While all this was going on, however, the work of confirming vendors and issuing payments remainedincomplete. As recently as a few weeks before the eventwas to begin, a talent producersaid, the stage and transportation had yet to be secured.
Fyre Media Inc., founded in 2015 by McFarland and rapper Ja Rule, began asa talent booking app. For some time, McFarland simultaneously ran Fyre and Magnises, a social club for millennials. By the end of 2016, both McFarland and his right hand man, Grant Margolin, hadshifted their focus to Fyre, said aperson who worked with McFarland at one of thecompanies. Money management was an issue at Magnises, as no formal payroll company was hired and invoices were paid withpersonal checks, wire transfers, and formal corporate checks, said the person, whorequested anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss internal workings of the firm. They characterized McFarland, 25, as genuine, well-meaning, and interested in the happiness of his clients, but inexperienced. McFarland and Margolin didn’treturn several requests for comment.
When it came to the Fyre Festival, hiring a public relations teamwas the priority. Long before catering and local vendors were signed, glossy ads featuring supermodels Bella Hadid, Elsa Hosk, and Alessandra Ambrosio began to appear. On Instagram, celebrities shared photos portraying a picturesque beach holiday to promote the festival. McFarlandbooked such artists as Tyga, Blink 182, and Major Lazer.
Ticket purchasers werepromised an all-inclusive weekend—top notch food, luxurious lodging, and hot entertainment in a stunning locale. “Fyre is tirelessly working with a variety of local and international chefs to create a one-of-a-kind culinary experience,” organizers promised in aMedium postlast month. For an additional fee, attendees could purchase “exclusiveculinary experiences.”
About six weeks ahead of the festival, eventorganizers approached Starr Catering Group to execute afood plan.The catering firm’s staffers flew to the Bahamas for a site visit, according to a personfamiliar with the tripwho requested anonymitybecause they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about it.Following the review,Starr presented organizers witha 100-plus page plan detailing the meals,who would work the event, and how food service for thousands of attendees across two weekends would be organized.
The catering costwas in the high six-figures, the personsaid. Festival organizersbalked. “They said they did not have anywhere close to that budget,” the personsaid. “They said they had other caterers that could do it for the budget they had.” Starr and Fyre went their separate ways, but some attendees said they were still under the impressionwhen they arrived that the high-end company was catering the event. When they got to the food tent, they were quickly disabused of that idea.
Fyre Media didn’t reply to a request for commentabout their catering budget.A spokeswoman for Starr said in a statement thatthe caterer terminated their contract in early April after it “realized that there were significant business issues that could not be resolved and would not allow them to deliver a premium food and beverage experience that met Starr’s exceedingly high demands.”
Explaining why the decision was made to “postpone” the event, Fyre Festival organizers didn’t mention housing or food. Instead, they cited safety issues. In a statement, they said securitycouldn’t“keep up,” but didn’t elaborate. In aMedium post, Fyre Festival said it had been “working with local law enforcement, private contractors, and the Royal Bahamian Defense Force to provide a secure festival experience.”
Contacted by phone, a spokesman for the Royal Bahamian Defense Force said they hadn’t even heard of the festival.
In addition to paying for tickets, festival attendees were urged to load money onto their “Fyre Bands,” radio frequency identification wristbands that could be used to pay for various upgrades, like beach tours featuring indigenous pigs ($135) or boat rentals ($9,000). The wristbands were commissioned from Connect&Go, according to an April 23 Medium post from event organizers that suggested attendees add at least $300 per day for “incidental expenses and upgrades.”
Fyre Festival hired Connect&Go about six weeks prior to the event, a personwith knowledge of the discussions said.The terms of their contract required the festival to pay the company up front, which they did. But theFyre Band balances remain in limbo:Organizers didn’t address how, or whether, that money would berefunded. (Connect&Go isn’t accused of any wrongdoing.)
And it wasn’t just ticket-holders and vendors who were caught up in the event’s unraveling. Prior to the festival, organizers contacted the local chapter of the Red Cross and the Exuma Foundation, both charities on the island. In an April 19 post, organizers said they would “donate gently used items after the festival closes.” Organizers did, in fact, contact the Red Cross, according to a person involved in the discussions.They sought a duty waiver form from the charity, said the person, who requested anonymity because they aren’tauthorized to comment on thematter.
The Red Cross provided the waiver form,but didn’treceive a donation, the person said. Fyre Media andlocal customs officialsdidn’t respond to requests for comment on the question of duties. The Exuma Foundation didn’t respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Red Cross in the Bahamas couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.
Given the litany of complaints, attendees were talking lawsuit before they even left the island. On Monday, the first one dropped. The complaint filed in Los Angeles was brought by asingle ticket-holderwho accused Fyre Festival organizers of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. Daniel Jung seeks to represent the thousands of people who flew to the tropical festival, and his lawyers, led by Mark Geragos, hung anattention-grabbing $100 million pricetag on the litigation.
Jungaccuses organizersof warning musicians and celebrities to refrain from coming to the festival without cautioning theticket-holders.“Defendants only ‘cancelled’ the event on the morning of the first day—after thousands of attendees had already arrived and were stranded, without food, water, or shelter,” according to hiscomplaint.
More are planning to join the litigation, according to lawyers lining top to take their cases. Meanwhile, the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism is scrambling to keepthe fallout from damaging the local economy, assuring potential vacationers that Great Exuma is a fully developed island with no infrastructure issues.
“The organizers of the event, which was a private event, have readily admitted that they were in over their heads, and they have taken full responsibility for all that has transpired,” said Joy Jibrilu, the ministry’s director general.
McFarland has repeatedly promised full refunds, though on Monday the promise was of another ticket. “All guests from this year will have free VIP passes to next year’s festival,” the organizers said in a statement posted to their websiteon Monday, not saying where or when that event would be. An email sent to festival-goers, meanwhile, offers the ability to apply for a refund online.
“The festival was a no-refund ticketed event, however, event organizers are making efforts to refund approved requests from confirmed attendees and confirmed ticket-holders,” according to thewebsite, noting that those who dispute the charges through their credit card company won’t be refunded.Organizers didn’t return a request for comment on the refund application, which remindsattendees of their ability to exchange their tickets for “additional 2018 VIP passes.” The choice of replies are, “Yes, let it ride. I'd love to support you all in creating something amazing!” and “No, I’m not down for the adventure.” (The Bahamian government reportedly banned the organizers from holding another festival in the country.)
Despite the festival’s failure,some attendeesstayed and tried to make the most of it. Dylan Caccamesi, a 22-year-old from New Jersey, wasn’t able to get a flight out until late Friday night, so he andhis friends spent the extra day partying on the beach and drinking margaritas. He stayed in a tent overnight, rather than the floor of the airport terminal.
Crossno (or Finley), the writer from North Carolina who paid almost $4,000 for his ticket, wasn’t quite so sanguine about how things turned out. He found himself stuck in the airport overnight, listening toMcFarland apologize to the packed roomover a speakerphone.The stranded attendees began writing down their names and contact information on sheets of printer paper to get on a list of refund requests. Crossno said he saw people sobbing, just hoping to get off the island. He eventually made it on to a flight at about 9:30 a.m. the next morning.
Hesaid that, as bad as the experience was,he’s also angry how he and his fellow concert-goers have been portrayed in the media schadenfreude festival that followed.
“It isn’t this rich white kid thing they keep talking about–there were people from all walks of life,” said Crossno. “They were just trying to go to something they thought would be cool.”",0
"This is how you Make America Great Again!
The United States unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in nearly 17 years during the month of October. While at the same time job creation continued climbing steadily after the two devastating hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico hit us. The jobless rate fell to 4.1 percent, down a tenth of a point from just a month ago, the lowest the US economy has seen since before the dot-com bubble burst back in December of 2000. Job creators added 261,000 net new jobs as businesses reopened in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in just those areas alone.
The result showed US job markets are in good health easily bouncing back from the storms that paused the energy hub in southeast Texas and forced millions of Floridians to have to flee their homes back in September. The data for that month also turned out not be as negative as was initially reported where 8,000 new jobs created rather than a loss of 33,000 positions as was predicted initially.
Now see folks? What the US really needed wasn’t so-called “Recovery Summer” fake narratives that never came from the Barack Hussein Obama administration. We needed a real president, one who understands business, capitalism and the American way. All a president had to do is unlock the chains of regulations and let the American economy and its people do their thing.
Vice President Joe Biden today will kick off the Obama administration’s “Recovery Summer,” a six-week-long push designed to highlight the jobs accompanying a surge in stimulus-funded projects to improve highways, parks, drinking water and other public works.
David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president, said: “This summer will be the most active Recovery Act season yet, with thousands of highly-visible road, bridge, water and other infrastructure projects breaking ground across the country, giving the American people a first-hand look at the Recovery Act in their own backyards and making it crystal clear what the cost would have been of doing nothing.”
Biden, President Barack Obama and other administration officials will travel to more than two dozen Recovery Act project sites in coming weeks. On Friday, the president will travel to Columbus, Ohio, to mark the groundbreaking of the 10,000th Recovery Act road project to get under way. The administration says the road improvement project in downtown Columbus is expected to create over 300 construction jobs, and will contribute to a broader economic development effort in the area around Nationwide Children’s Hospital.
On Monday, Biden will travel to Midland, Mich., for the groundbreaking of the new Dow Kokam advanced battery manufacturing facility – a project made possible by a $161 million Recovery Act advanced battery grant awarded last year. In addition to creating 1,000 construction jobs, Dow says the project will eventually employ 800 permanent manufacturing workers.
Axelrod continued: “In the face of the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, Republicans in Congress chose to play politics with economic recovery and declared the Recovery Act a failure before it even began. They made a cynical bet that if the President fails, they win. Democrats chose to act by tackling the crisis head-on. Just over a year later, the Recovery Act is putting millions of Americans to work and helping the economy grow again. But our work is far from over:”
Kevin Smith, a spokesman for House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio), responded: “The president’s trillion-dollar ‘stimulus’ has failed to meet his most basic promises on job creation, and Axelrod knows that. We’ve lost 3 million jobs since the ‘stimulus’ was enacted. Yet another desperate sales pitch about the virtues of massive government spending and piling up more debt on our kids and grandkids isn’t going to fool anyone.”
The vice president on Thursday will present Obama with a report laying out a spike in stimulus activity this summer, and how it will contribute to a steady climb to a total of 3.5 million Recovery Act jobs by the end of the year. Highlights:
“ Transportation: There will be six times as many highway projects underway in July 2010 as in July 2009 – projects will surge from 1,750 last summer to over 10,000 this summer. And while last summer we improved about 9,000 miles of highway, this summer we’ll improve over 30,000 miles – that’s the equivalent of ten cross-country road trips on improved highways.
“ Clean and Drinking Water: This summer over 3,000 clean and drinking water projects will have started versus just over 100 last summer – that’s nearly 30 times as many.
Let us hope and pray that the 8 long dark years of the Barry Soetoro administration serve as a lesson to the American voters. It’s better to vote for a candidate because of the content of his/her character and experience, not just because of the color of his skin or, even worse because he’s considered “cool.” Obama will go down in history as the president that “couldn’t” but was given more than enough chances because of the color of his skin. That’s a sad footnote in US history.

The left-wing group that organized the violent riot that shut down of the Milo Yiannopoulos event in Berkeley, CA is backed by none other than George Soros.
George Soros has been kicked out of multiple countries for fomenting dissent and rebellion through funding these fascist groups.
He is in short trying to impose a new world order through the backdoor. But ginning up support and paying rioters to carry out demonstrations, he creates the illusion that Trump is unpopular.
All recent polling – and polls always undercount Trump support – show Trump’s numbers are skyrocketing.
This is a well-planned assault on democracy and Soros was getting away with it. But there has been a shift, a conservative awakening sweeping the globe. And it is kicking Soros out of country after country.
Here is the links between Soros and the rioters. According to breitbart,
The Alliance for Global Justice is funded by the George Soros-backed Tides Foundation, reportedly donated $50,000 to fund Refuse Fascism, which openly brags about using violence to shut down conservative and libertarian speech.
“While it is unclear whether those who carried out the violence were paid to do so, the benefactors of the Alliance for Global Justice — and Refuse Fascism — are listed online,” reported the Daily Caller. “According to its most recent 990 tax form, Alliance for Global Justice (AfGJ) received $2.2 million in funding for the fiscal year ending in March 2016. One of the group’s biggest donors is the Tides Foundation, a non-profit funded by billionaire progressive philanthropist George Soros. Tides gave AfGJ $50,000.”

"WASHINGTON - Fewer Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, close to historical lows in a sign that the job market is healthy. And another key labor indicator released today -- US worker productivity -- showed renewed strength at last.
The Labor Department said applications for jobless aid fell 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 229,000 last week. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, dropped to a 44-year low of 232,500. The four-week average was previously that low in April 1973, when the US economy had a smaller population and fewer total workers.
One wrinkle, though, is that Puerto Rico is processing backlogged claims for unemployment benefits after facing disruptions due to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the government said.
Still, the report suggests that employers are holding onto their workers and possibly seeking to add jobs.
Economists forecast that the Labor Department's report for October, to be released Friday, will show a robust gain of 308,000 jobs.
The Labor Department also reported on Thursday that US workers' productivity jumped 3 percent in the third quarter, the strongest gain in three years, while labor costs remained moderate.
The report says the increase in productivity in the July-September quarter was double the 1.5 percent gain in the second quarter. Unit labor costs rose a modest 0.5 percent in the third quarter, up only slightly from a 0.3 percent gain in the second quarter.
Economists don't expect the strong upturn in productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, to last. But they're hopeful that future gains will be stronger than the anemic performance of recent years.
And they say increasing productivity is the biggest challenge currently facing the economy, and without an improvement in this metric, the Trump administration's goal of boosting growth won't be realized.",0
"The economy lost 33,000 jobs in the month of September, after hurricanes Harvey and Irma damaged crucial economies in Florida and Texas. The storms had less of an impact on the unemployment rate, which dropped to 4.2 percent.
It’s the first time since 2010 that the employment market has dipped into the negative — job gains have averaged around 175,000 a month so far this year.
Friday's official data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirmed what market watchers had forecast: Back-to-back storms during the month of September meant economists were anticipating — at best — low double digit job gains, with the most optimistic pegging the latest jobs figure at 90,000. Fed Chair Janet Yellen even warned last month that “storm-related disruptions” would “affect economic activity in the near term.”
The average hurricane knocks about 50,000 jobs off the market, according to CNBC. And, since jobs data is collected during the week that contains the 12th of the month, September figures captured the tail end of Hurricane Irma as well as the extended impacts of Harvey.
However, the weak September jobs figure is just a temporary blip on the general healthy economic outlook, and is not expected to have any lingering impact.
“Past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term,” the Fed noted in its statement last month.

"Signs are pointing to a tough flu season for the U. S. this year.
While influenza has not quite reached epidemic levels yet, it’s spreading farther and faster than it did at the same time last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.
Flu is already widespread in seven states: Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Virginia. During this same week in 2016, influenza was not widespread in any states.
And three states — Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina — have high levels of flu already this year.
Influenza has already killed seven children this season, the CDC said. It killed at least 95 children in the 2016-2017 season, and the CDC found that at least three-quarters of kids who died from influenza between 2010 and 2014 had not been vaccinated in the months before they got sick.
Related: Here's one reason flu vaccines can be so lousy
Flu causes an epidemic every single year in the U. S. and most of the rest of the world. Flu is so common that health officials don’t count every single case. Instead, they calculate how bad flu is by the proportion of deaths that are shown to have been caused by pneumonia and influenza.
That number takes a few weeks to calculate but in the week that ended November 18, 5.7 percent of reported deaths were caused by pneumonia and influenza.
“This percentage is below the epidemic threshold of 6.6 percent for week 46,” the CDC said.
“The United States alone sees 140,000 to 710,000 influenza-related hospitalizations and 12,000 to 56,000 deaths each year, with the highest burden of disease affecting the very young, the very old, and people with coexisting medical conditions,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, wrote in a commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine.
While the CDC recommends flu vaccine for everyone over the age of 6 months, the vaccine is not terribly effective and this year’s vaccine seems especially unpromising.
Each flu vaccine protects against either three or four different strains of flu, but one component, the H3N2 strain, seems especially weak. During Australia’s flu season just ended, the H3N2 component only provided about 10 percent protection against severe influenza, Fauci noted.
Related: Australia's bad flu season may be bad news for U. S.
Research published last month helps explain why: most influenza vaccines are produced in chicken eggs, and that process makes the virus mutate, thus making the vaccine produced using the virus less effective.
“Given that most of the U. S. influenza-vaccine supply is currently produced in eggs and the composition of the 2017–2018 Northern Hemisphere vaccine is identical to that used in Australia, it is possible that we will experience low vaccine effectiveness against influenza A (H3N2) viruses and a relatively severe influenza season if they predominate,” Fauci wrote.
Nonetheless, Fauci and other top health experts say it’s worth getting the vaccine.
“It is always better to get vaccinated than not to get vaccinated,” Fauci said. It’s more effective against the H1N1 and influenza B strains that are also spreading.
“In this regard, the CDC estimates that influenza vaccination averted 40,000 deaths in the United States between the 2005–2006 and 2013–2014 seasons,” Fauci wrote.
The good news is that the virus has not evolved resistance to the drugs, including Tamiflu, that can be used to treat influenza. People can also protect themselves and other from flu by washing their hands frequently and covering sneezes and coughs.",0
"The main U. S. energy regulator can get back to the business of approving multibillion-dollar natural gas pipelinesafter the Senate moved to fill two of four vacancies at the long-crippled agency.
Senators on Thursday confirmed the nominations to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of Robert Powelson, former chairman of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and Neil Chatterjee, a senior aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
With their appointments, the five-seat panel regains the quorum it needs to approve liquefied natural gas export terminals, clear natural gas pipelines and issue rules governing wholesale power markets. FERC was without a quorum for six months, a stalemate that potentially slowed $50 billion of energy ventures under consideration by the agency.
“We aren’t counting our chickens yet, but the approvals would certainly be a net positive for midstream industry growth, and, ultimately, for producers and consumers of natural gas,” said Ethan Bellamy, a managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co. in Denver.
The most pressing matter facing the new commissioners is the approval of the $2 billion Nexus pipeline that was expected to start moving natural gas by November from Ohio to Ontario. The slow pace of filling FERC vacancies has forced Nexus developers DTE Energy Co. and Enbridge Inc.’s Spectra Energy to push their in-service date to sometime in 2018, DTE Chief Executive Officer Gerry Anderson said on a July earnings call. The project still awaits FERC’s permission to start construction, which could take up to 10 months to complete.
At least five other natural gas pipelines worth at least $10 billion are also awaiting FERC permits while facing increasingly narrow construction windows.
Projects such as Dominion Energy Inc.’s $4.5 billion Atlantic Coast pipeline and the$3.5 billion Mountain Valley pipeline to be operated by EQT Corp. are aiming to start construction this year, before environmental rules protecting bird migration and animal roosting kick in during the spring.Together, the two lines would deliver enough gas to heat 62,000 homes through the winter, according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration.
Other pressing projects in FERC’s pipeline include TransCanada Corp.’s $2 billion Mountaineer Xpress and Gulf Xpress pipelines, which received their final environmental reviews in July, and the $1 billion PennEast pipeline. PennEast Pipeline Co. developers including AGL Resources Service Co., Public Service Enterprise Group and Spectra Energy Partners hoped to receive federal approval this year to start construction in 2018.
The appointment of new commissioners doesn’t necessarily mean those projects’ permits will move quickly, however. On average, it takes 30 days for new commissioners to issue a project permit after being confirmed, and about 12 days after taking office, according to a note by FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Powelson and Chatterjee will join acting Chairman Cheryl LaFleur, the lone commissioner on the five-seat panel, and will begin working through a massive backlog.
For the past six months, FERC has been unable to approve new hydropower plants, rule on contested utility mergers, or finalize settlement agreements in market-manipulation cases. A proposed rule on commercial-battery storage has been on hold, as is a decision on adjusting FERC’s disputed income tax allowance policy for master limited partnership pipelines.

The commission also is waiting for the appointment of two additional members.
President Donald Trump has nominated Kevin McIntyre as the new Republican chairman, replacing Lafleur, a Democrat. Senior Senate staffer Richard Glick has been nominated to fill the last remaining Democratic seat on the panel.
Both nominees are scheduled to testify Sept. 7 before the the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which would bring them a step closer to being confirmed.",0
"In San Francisco, someone would need to earn $58.04 an hour to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment at fair market rent.
If you work in the fastest-growing occupation in the United States–as a personal care aide assisting elderly and disabled people–you probably earn a little more than minimum wage. But that’s not enough to afford a two-bedroom rental anywhere in the country. In more than 99% of American counties, it’s not even enough to make a one-bedroom affordable.
A newreportfrom the National Low Income Housing Coalition maps out the wage a full-time worker needs to make for a modest apartment or rental house to be affordable in each county in the U. S. (“affordable” is defined as spending less than 30% of your income on housing costs). On average, you’d need to make $21.21 per hour to rent a two-bedroom and $17.14 for a one-bedroom. The mean American wage is $16.38 an hour. The federal minimum wage is $7.25.
Between 2007 and 2015, the median rent rose 6%, adjusted for inflation; the median income for renter households rose 1%. [Image: National Low Income Housing Coalition]
While the cost of rent has risen, wages haven’t kept pace. Between 2007 and 2015, the median rent rose 6%, adjusted for inflation; the median income for renter households rose 1%. The situation is worse in some cities. In San Francisco, for example, as the city phases in a $15-an-hour minimum wage (currently at $13, set to rise to $14 on July 1), someone would need to earn $58.04 an hour to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment at fair market rent. In California overall, the “housing wage” needed to afford a two-bedroom is $30.92 an hour; at minimum wage, that would translate into working 118 hours a week.

Federal housing assistance programs are underfunded, but the report makes the point that we don’t lack the resources–the country spends around $200 billion each year on housing subsidies. It’s just that the majority of this goes to the rich in the form of tax deductions on mortgage payments. 83% of the money the government spends on housing goes to households making more than $100,000 a year, and more than three-quarters goes to families making more than $200,000. Oneproposalnow in Congress: reduce the deductions for those earning the most, and use the savings to help the 55 million households that earn less than $50,000 a year afford a place to live–particularly the 20 million Americans who now live in “housing poverty,” meaning they can’t afford to buy enough food, pay medical bills, or meet other basic needs after they pay for housing costs.",1
"A quarterback has been cut from a Pennsylvania college football team for kneeling during the National Anthem. Now if the NFL would just follow suit.
insider.foxnews.com reports: A liberal arts college in eastern Pennsylvania cut its backup quarterback after he knelt during the national anthem.

HAMILTON, BERMUDA — “So, the sub is going to tip forward, that’s normal. Then it’s going to roll on its back, just tip back a little bit, that’s also normal. Here we go!”
That’s my co-pilot Kelvin Magee. The two of us are barefoot inside the Nomad, a two-person submersible. The captain shouts orders as the crew work cranes and levers.
Divers paddle nearby, ready to guide our path or rescue us. Everyone is tense because the water is choppy. One wrong wave could toss the 7,000-pound Nomad into the ship’s stern. Magee, a member of the Nekton mission, flips a switch, and our four-hour journey to the seafloor begins.
Then the ocean swallows us. The submersible drops 110 feet in four minutes, as the sunlight fades. Rather than feel suffocated by claustrophobia, the opposite happens. The dwindling sunrays reveal a welcoming expanse, full of tranquility.
As we descend, my mind drifts to the corals below and their collective fate around the world. Many creatures will lose against global warming, but coral reefs are exceptionally vulnerable.
The Nekton Mission is an alliance of 30 organizations conducting the longest seafloor survey in history. Think of it as a physical exam for the ocean. Future groups will be able to use the mission’s baseline findings to chart how oceans will respond to human-made threats like global warming. The project is sponsored by XL Catlin, a global insurance company from Ireland that has sponsored similar environmental surveys since 2009. None of the work is proprietary, and the data are open access so other researchers can use them.
Nekton scientists will coast through the Gully Marine Protected Area, a large underwater canyon near Nova Scotia, and will explore the swirling gyre of the Sargasso Sea.
It is day 16 of the mission, and Alex Rogers, Nekton’s chief scientist and an Oxford conservation biologist, is diving in a twin submersible called Nemo. The plan is to plunge 850 feet at Tiger, a site off southeast Bermuda.
“This place is called Tiger because of tiger sharks, so who knows, you might even see one of the ocean’s spectacular predators while you’re down there,” Rogers had said earlier that morning at a prep meeting aboard the Baseline Explorer, a 150-foot research vessel. Shipping containers littered the deck. Some contained diving supplies for the volunteers from Project Baseline, a global citizen science initiative of 10,000 underwater explorers. Other containers housed fully equipped labs.
ScienceScope joined Nekton on this voyage to answer an important question: More than a third of the planet’s reefs are threatened by climate change, but can they adapt?
The Great Barrier Reef raised this question early last year. The entire reef didn’t die despite what you may have read in a viral fake report in Outside Magazine. Yet in 2016, a 435-mile portion of the northernmost section of the Great Barrier Reef suffered bleaching — the largest event on record — and 67 percent of the coral in that area died. Bleaching events covered the central and southern reef in 1998 and 2002, meaning the majority of Great Barrier Reef’s 134,000 square miles has suffered massive bleaching in the last 20 years. If total death were to strike Great Barrier Reef — the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem — Australia’s economy would lose $5.7 billion.
“People don’t realize the thing we’re trying to keep alive is the size of Italy,” Brett Lewis, a marine researcher at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, told me via phone. Lewis studies the mechanics of coral bleaching — how it happens step by step.
Bleaching doesn’t always kill coral. It’s a survival tactic employed by zooxanthellate corals — species that sap nutrients from algae embedded in their polyps. When algae face sustained warming or other stress, their photosynthesis breaks down, and hazardous substances known as “reactive oxygen species” emerge like toxic waste.
The coral respond by expelling the algae — and it can be violent! When Lewis and colleagues exposed Heliofungia actiniformis, a mushroom coral, to extended periods of heat in a lab tank, the critters responded by expanding and contracting like balloons during the algae eviction.
“Imagine you or I just sitting there, and all of a sudden our tissue inflates to 340 percent of our current size,” Lewis said. “This expansion is very new. This is the first time that it’s been documented in coral bleaching.”
However, it won’t be the last. Coral can recuperate from bleaching, once temperatures drop and algae populations recover. (The coral in Lewis’ experiment recovered and are alive today).
But elevated sea temperatures caused by global warming mean algae and coral may have less time to recover between bleaching events. That’s why coral died in droves when El Nino hit the northern Great Barrier Reef in early 2016.
Take a closer look, and a pattern emerges. The worst carnage tends to involve coral in shallow water, which is a trend seen across the globe. So far, one-fifth of the world’s shallow water reefs have perished, according to a report by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network. Rogers and others predict mass bleaching events, once decadal events, will happen once or twice a year for most shallow water coral by 2050.
A dire prediction, unless of course, the coral pick up and leave.
When temps go high, can coral go low?
As Nemo and Nomad plunged deeper into the Atlantic, the blue deepened as seawater more readily absorbed the reds, oranges and yellows in the sunlight. Picture the shades between dead of night and predawn, and you’ll know the color.
We had ventured into the mesophotic zone — a colder, more thermally stable region that might serve as a refuge for corals affected by bleaching.
Located 131 to more than 500 feet underwater, this twilight zone escapes the warming waters and other anthropogenic threats like waste runoff, which tend to pool near the sea surface. Most mesophotic coral reefs are left over from 18,000 years ago on continental slopes, when sea level was 400 feet lower than today. Unlike surface corals, mesophotic species are a mixture of those dependent on algae and corals that feed on other sea creatures.
All corals start as little larvae that get swept around by currents, before attaching in a single spot. So, scientists like Rogers are investigating reef connectivity — the extent to which shallow water reef species exist in the mesophotic zone too. Mesophotic reefs could function as migration stations for shallow water coral and fish during times of crisis, which is known as the deep water refugia hypothesis.
Magee flicked on Nomad’s lights, revealing a garden of corals spread across Bermuda’s sharply sloped seabed. We saw oodles of butterfly fish and pink roughtongue bass swimming through twisted wire corals, gorgonian sea fans and hydrocorals — a type of irregular sea fan. Neon green moray eels stuck their necks from the seabed. Oh look! A slipper lobster!
The submersibles are equipped with filming equipment, so the researchers can document the biodiversity. Each has a low-power laser that serves as an underwater ruler. By pulsing into the seafloor, the laser judges physical perspective so the team can measure the sizes of fish and corals.
A five-foot-long dog shark whipped from behind a natural bridge, and then darted away. His departure raised a question: How does this survey grasp the habitat’s full diversity when so many creatures skitter off?
The answer is environmental DNA. Rogers explained the concept, via radio, as Nemo cruised next to us at an 850-foot depth.
“The idea is when there are animals and other organisms present in the environment, they release cells,” Rogers said. Skin cells, scales and poop gets left behind, with DNA packed inside. Imagine if you put your hand in a big glass of water, and a few cells fall off your hand. Scientists can take that water and sequence it. A set of long plastic bottles hang off the Nomad’s bow for this purpose.
Later, the biosurvey data will be amassed and shared among Nekton’s research team. Gretchen Goodbody-Gringley, a reef ecologist at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, collaborates on the project. While Rogers and I coasted along the seafloor, Goodbody-Gringley and a team of Project Baseline divers conducted similar surveys closer to the surface.
“Alex formerly worked in deep corals and has moved up to mesophotic, whereas I started in shallows and have moved down to mesophotic,” Goodbody-Gringley said. “So in a sense, we’re converging.”
The divers double-hosed tanks look like a Jacques Cousteau invention, but the equipment is actually a state-of-the-art rebreather system that recycles the air that they exhale. It permits extra long dives, which are helped by fan-powered scooters.
“If we were to do only the 300-foot transects and come straight up, we would have to decompress for about three hours,” Todd Kincaid, Project Baseline director, said later on the ship’s deck. But with the scooter, the divers can travel at 1.5 miles per hour and follow the gentle slope of the sea floor, as they collect observations at a 300-, 200-, 100- and 50-feet-depth. The process take close to three hours, so they can decompress while they work.
Together, the environmental DNA sequencing and visual surveys offer a broad picture of Bermuda’s biodiversity and the connectivity between shallow and mesophotic habitats.
So, that’s it? Mesophotic corals to the rescue! Not so fast.
“We still don’t really know where all of these reefs are, what lives there, and how these communities function,” said Daniel Holstein, a coral reef ecologist at Duke Marine Lab who is unaffiliated with Nekton.
Holstein supports the so-called “deep reef refugia” hypothesis. His research has found deeper corals produce more eggs per polyp relative to shallow-water coral.
Yet in some areas, deep and shallow corals aren’t connected by ocean currents, so larvae migration might be naturally impossible. Researchers are thinking about rearing certain types of coral in a lab and the reintroducing them into mesophotic zones. But first they need to know where species can already survive. Yet it’s clear some shallow water species — elegant, lanky elkhorns — can’t make the migration, Holstein said. They rely too heavily on algae and sunlight.
Such is the case in the Caribbean, said University of the Virgin Islands coral reef ecologist Tyler Smith. A 2005 bleaching event and disease have imperiled the diversity of surface-hugging corals. Elkhorn and staghorn corals have declined precipitously, Smith said.
His team reported last year that mesophotic reefs near the Virgin Islands are also susceptible to bleaching. Due to the shape of the seabed, ocean currents can force warm surface water downward, putting mesophotic corals at risk during heat waves. The observation suggests that the deep reef refugia hypothesis may only apply on a location by location basis. Prior observations in the eastern Pacific near Panama found mesophotic fire corals had repopulated shallow regions after multiple El Nino events devastated populations. Fire corals near Panama, for instance, were wiped out for 2,500 years at one point and then returned.
Smith feels the hypothesis needs an edit. It isn’t that cold and deep versus warm and shallow dictate coral survival. It’s the change relative to the regular temperature.
“What you really need to have are environments that stay consistently cool relative to their average conditions,” Smith said. So if coral have already adapted to repeated temperature fluctuations in a particular area, then those reefs may persist through future climate change. Hence why Goodbody-Gringley, Rogers, Nekton and leagues of ecologists are scurrying around the globe in an attempt to identify which coral ecosystems are most vulnerable.
As Nemo and Nomad depart the seafloor, the coral forests fade into the background, but the scientists’ concerns remain. The submersibles race our air bubbles to the surface. I bid farewell to the sea cucumbers and slipper lobsters. Our sub’s dome breaches. Reality returns.",0
"The proportion of U. S. babies born suffering from withdrawal syndrome after exposure to heroin or prescription opiates in utero has more than doubled in less than a decade, a study suggests.
Researchers focused on what's known as neonatal abstinence syndrome, a condition akin to withdrawal that develops when babies essentially become addicted to drugs their mothers use during pregnancy.
Nationally, the rate of neonatal abstinence syndrome involving mothers' use of opiates - which includes heroin as well as prescription narcotics like codeine and Vicodin - surged from 2.8 cases for every 1,000 births in 2009 to 7.3 cases for every 1,000 births in 2013, the study found.
At least some of this surge in the case count is due to drug policies designed to crack down on prescription drug abuse and combat the methamphetamine epidemic, said lead study author Dr. Joshua Brown, a pharmacy researcher at the University of Kentucky in Lexington.
""The drug policies of the early 2000s were effective in reducing supply - we have seen a decrease in methamphetamine abuse and there have been reductions in some aspects of prescription drug abuse,"" Brown said by email. ""However, the indirect results, mainly the increase in heroin abuse, were likely not anticipated and we are just starting to see these.""
The findings of the current study add to a growing body of evidence pointing to a surge in births of babies suffering from opiate withdrawal. One report last month from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found an even bigger spike over a longer period, from 1.5 cases for every 1,000 births in 1999 to 6 cases per 1,000 in 2013.
CDC researchers also found wide variation in neonatal abstinence syndrome by state, ranging in 2013 from 0.7 cases for every 1,000 births in Hawaii to 33.4 cases per 1,000 in West Virginia.
""We know that certain states are harder hit by the opioid/heroin abuse epidemic, with about 10 states contributing half of all neonatal abstinence syndrome cases,"" Brown said. ""These states are often more rural and impoverished areas of the U. S. such as Mississippi, Alabama, and West Virginia.""
Brown and colleagues looked at Kentucky in particular. Here, the rate of neonatal abstinence syndrome climbed from 5 cases for every 1,000 births in 2008 to 21.2 cases per 1,000 births in 2014, researchers report in JAMA Pediatrics.
While the study didn't look at health outcomes for babies born suffering from drug withdrawal, these infants often require intensive medical care. (See Reuters' 2015 special report ""Helpless and Hooked"" here: http://reut.rs/1NSc7uC)
These babies may have central nervous system issues like seizures and tremors, gastrointestinal problems and feeding difficulties, breathing challenges, as well as unstable body temperatures.
Typically, they remain in the hospital for several weeks after birth and receive low doses of methadone, a medicine designed to wean addicts off heroin and prescription opiates, Brown said.
Treatment can ease withdrawal symptoms in newborns, but can't necessarily address developmental problems these infants may have later on, said Dr. William Carey, a pediatrics researcher at pediatrics at Mayo Clinic Children's Center in Rochester, Minnesota.
""While abuse of prescription opiates has declined, the use of illicit opiates has increased such that there may be a zero-sum game at best,"" Carey, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. ""Since maternal use of either prescription opiates or illicit opiates is associated with withdrawal in newborns, it is reasonable to think that any increase in the overall use of opiates would be linked to an increase in the rate of neonatal abstinence syndrome.""",0
"LIBERATING ELDER – LOL, THIS IS TOO GOOD. JUST LAST WEEK CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN WAS THREATENING TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES AND FORM A NEW NATION. TODAY HE IS CALLING ‘MR. TRUMP’, HAT IN HAND, TO BEG FOR MONEY TO KEEP HIS STATE AFLOAT. FRICKING LIBERALS, EVERYTHING IS ALL GOOD UNTIL THEY RUN OUT OF OTHER PEOPLES MONEY …
Fox 40 reported: LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown has asked President Trump to declare a major disaster for California because of damage from January storms.
The letter sent Friday says the relentless series of storms caused flooding, mudslides, evacuations, erosion, power outages and at least eight deaths. Northern California was hardest hit.
Brown says the storm system was so severe and widespread that state and local governments need federal assistance to continue dealing with the problems it created.
In a separate action, the governor added Amador, Mono and Riverside to the 49 counties included in an emergency proclamation Brown issued last month.
THIS ALSO COMES JUST DAYS AFTER CALIFORNIA HAD THE GAUL TO SUBMIT A REQUEST TO PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR $100,000,000,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE. THEY WANT THE MONEY BUT WILL NOT FOLLOW THE LAWS … SOUNDS JUST LIKE THE SNOWFLAKE KIDS LIVING IN THEIR PARENTS BASEMENT THAT VOTED THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT INTO POWER.

"In July of 1941, a small group of Americans, all of them volunteers, gathered at a tiny airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama. Their goal? To build a special fighter unit for the U. S. Army Air Corps. It was not the planes they flew or the weapons they employed that made them unique. It was the color of their skin.
In the 1940s our military, like our country, was segregated. And many inside Washington power circles believed black men didn’t have the courage or the skill to fly combat aircraft. Forced to train and serve in a segregated unit, the Tuskegee Airmen would have to prove them wrong. And they did. They overcame racism at home and abroad and by the end World War II, these pilots earned military respect for their air prowess.
Nicknamed the ""Red Tails"" for the color painted on their aircraft, over 1,000 black aviators and thousands of mechanics and technicians were trained at Tuskegee. The Red Tails flew over 15,000 combat missions and destroyed over 250 enemy planes.
But perhaps their most impressive accomplishment didn’t involve destruction or death. They saved lives. As you will hear in this Sunday's episode, during Allied escort missions over Europe, these men never lost a bomber to the enemy.
In this inspiring episode of ""War Stories with Oliver North,"" you will meet some of the men who battled to fight for a country that didn’t see them as equal.

"Another young girl has died from Gardasil, the infamous HPV vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., and the medical establishment claims that it was a fluke. Twelve-year-old Meredith Prohaska from Waukesha, Wisconsin, died just a few hours after getting her Gardasil shot, and her parents are sure that the vaccine was the cause of death.
According toFOX6Now.com, Meredith was an otherwise healthy, fun-loving girl prior to her death. She did have a sore throat the day that she died, which is why her parents took her to the doctor in the first place. But it was a minor ailment that, in light of the events of that fateful day, couldn’t possibly have killed her that quickly or coincidentally.
Reports indicate that Meredith’s parents took her to the doctor during the morning hours of August 7. Around 10:30 am, she received her first HPV vaccine, which about 30 minutes later appeared to lull her into a deep sleep. Meredith’s mother Rebecca recalls having had to repeatedly wake her up so she could make it through the day.
Later that afternoon at around 3:30 pm, Rebecca left the house for about 30 minutes to get some food. When she returned, she found her daughter lying on the floor unconscious, upon which she initiated CPR — Rebecca served as an EMT (emergency medical technician) for the National Guard for 14 years, so she knew what she was doing.
When the CPR failed, Rebecca immediately called 911, and Meredith was rushed to the hospital. But it was too late — the girl was pronounced dead upon arrival, without explanation.
“It was the hardest thing when they called and said they don’t know,” stated Rebecca toFOX6Now.com. “There was no reason [for her death]. She was the healthiest 12-year-old.”
Rebecca decided to take a closer look at the HPV handout that she was given that morning, only to find that her daughter apparently suffered certain rare side effects caused by thevaccine. But when the media caught wind of the story, damage control was quickly engaged, with a professor and medical doctor from the Milwaukee Health Department claiming that the vaccine wasn’t to blame.
This doctor and professor is known as Geoffrey Swain, andVacTruth.comreports that he has sucked heavily from the teat of Big Vaccine. According to Dr. Swain’s resume, which is available through the Center for Urban Population Health (CUPH), this pro-vaccine spokesman has accepted more than $1 million from vaccine interests to defend and promote vaccines.
More than $900,000 of this bounty came from the CDC, which apparently tasked Dr. Swain with investigating immunization rates (whatever that means). Another nearly $160,000 was given by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a non-profit organization that promotes vaccines and looks for new ways to get more people vaccinated.
Dr. Swain’s resume is available for viewing here:
CUPH.org[PDF].
It is hardly surprising, then, that Dr. Swain publicly dismissed the concerns of the Prohaska family about the safety of Gardasil. In typical shill fashion, Dr. Swain quickly reassured the public that Gardasil is “very, very safe,” also emphasizing that it’s a “very safe vaccine and very effective.”
Of course it is, Dr. $wain.",1
"The race for Virginia attorney general got a lot more expensive Thursday as the biggest donors to both campaigns announced more than $500,000 each in new contributions to their party’s candidates.
The Republican Attorneys General Association donated $550,000 to John Adams (R), who is trying to unseat first-term incumbent Mark R. Herring (D) on Nov.7. The Republican group has now contributed about $4.1million to Adams, a conservative Richmond lawyer.
The Democratic Attorneys General Association was planning to announce later Thursday that it has pumped an additional $725,000 into Herring’s campaign fund — a $500,000 donation made last week and $225,000 this week — bringing its total cash contribution to $2.25million. The group has also made in-kind contributions worth about $470,000 to the progressive incumbent.
With 12 days to go until the election, Herring has the financial advantage in the race, with $6.2million raised to Adams’s $3.4million, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Political Access Project.
Most polls have shown Herring with a narrow but consistent lead in what has traditionally been a low-turnout election.
The Republican attorneys general group signaled earlier this year that it would break a long-standing practice of not spending money on races in which one candidate is an incumbent. Its Democratic counterpart quickly followed suit. The Virginia contest is the only attorney general’s race in the nation this fall.
Correction: An earlier version of this article had incorrect figures of $750,000 in new Democratic donations and $2.5 million in total cash contributions. The numbers have been revised.",0
"President Trump’s condemnation of NFL players that choose to kneel, rather than stand for the national anthem, reignited a national debate that began with Colin Kaepernick’s decision not to stand for the anthem last season as a protest against police brutality.
Over the weekend a plethora of players and even entire teams chose to either kneel or stay in the locker room during the playing of the national anthem – while many NFL owners released statements eliciting support for players who choose not to stand.
What many people are missing in this debate is the fact that prior to 2009, NFL teams did not generally stand for the anthem. While having the option to do so individually if they chose to, most of the time they stayed in the locker room during this pregame ritual.
In fact, Tom E. Curran of Comcast Sportsnet New England reported, in August 2016, that NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed that the now common practice of players standing on the field together for the national anthem only began in 2009.
Additionally, it has come to light that many of the “patriotic” pregame displays in the NFL are simply propaganda displays that were paid for by the U. S. Department of Defense and the National Guard – meaning that these displays were actually paid for by the American taxpayers.
These displays of patriotic propaganda, called “paid patriotism,” were brought to light in April 2015, when Arizona Senator Jeff Flake released a statement condemning the practice.
Then in November 2015, Flake and fellow Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain issued a report stating that the U. S. Department of Defense had been paying the NFL for patriotic displays in football and other sports between 2011 and 2014:
Contrary to the public statements made by DOD and the NFL, the majority of the contracts — 72 of the 122 contracts we analyzed — clearly show that DOD paid for patriotic tributes at professional football, baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer games. These paid tributes included on-field color guard, enlistment and reenlistment ceremonies, performances of the national anthem, full-field flag details, ceremonial first pitches and puck drops. The National Guard paid teams for the “opportunity” to sponsor military appreciation nights and to recognize its birthday. It paid the Buffalo Bills to sponsor its Salute to the Service game. DOD even paid teams for the “opportunity” to perform surprise welcome home promotions for troops returning from deployments and to recognize wounded warriors. While well intentioned, we wonder just how many of these displays included a disclaimer that these events were in fact sponsored by the DOD at taxpayer expense. Even with that disclosure, it is hard to understand how a team accepting taxpayer funds to sponsor a military appreciation game, or to recognize wounded warriors or returning troops, can be construed as anything other than paid patriotism.
In total, the Department of Defense paid 14 NFL teams $5.4 million from 2011 to 2014 for patriotic propaganda during NFL games.
U. S. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) called the spending wasteful spending that “leaves a bad taste in your mouth”:
“Those of us go to sporting events and see them honoring the heroes,” Flake said in an interview. “You get a good feeling in your heart. Then to find out they’re doing it because they’re compensated for it, it leaves you underwhelmed. It seems a little unseemly.”
“They realize the public believes they’re doing it as a public service or a sense of patriotism,” Flake continued. “It leaves a bad taste in your mouth.”
Former congressman Ron Paul released a video condemning the practice, asking,
The report by Senators Flake and McCain did not cover the years prior to 2011, thus having no way to verify whether this “paid patriotism” program began in 2009 – the year NFL teams began taking to the field as a team for the national anthem. However, logic would seem to indicate that it was not an organic manifestation given the widespread proclivity of teams and players to stay in the locker room during the anthem—for decades—prior to 2009.
The fact that all the teams in the NFL decided during the 2009 season to start coming to the field early for the national anthem seems to indicate that these actions, which were the exact behaviors pushed for in the “paid patriotism” propaganda program, were not organic, but begun as part of the Department of Defense propaganda program.
And, while the public argues over whether or not players should stand or kneel, there is no debate that this is government sponsored propaganda that is meant to indoctrinate people into supporting an imperial war machine that fights not for America and freedom, but for geopolitical power, access to energy resources, and hegemonic control of the global economic system as predicated by the petrodollar.
Please share this story to help awaken people to the fact that these “patriotic” displays are actually “paid patriotism” propaganda brought to you by the U. S. Department of Defense!",1
"Many of the well-meaning articles we Americans donate in times of disaster turn out to be of no use to those in need. Sometimes, they even get in the way. That's a message relief organizations very much want us to heed. Our Cover Story is reported now by Scott Simon of NPR. (An earlier version of this story was originally broadcast on ""Sunday Morning"" on April 24, 2016.)
The aftermath of Hurricane Harvey reminds us all over again that when Nature grows savage and angry, Americans can get generous and kind. That's admirable. It might also be a problem.
""Generally after a disaster, people with loving intentions donate things that cannot be used in a disaster response, and in fact may actually be harmful,"" said Juanita Rilling, former director of the Center for International Disaster Information in Washington, D. C. ""And they have no idea that they're doing it.""
Rilling has spent more than a decade trying to tell well-meaning people to think before they give.
* How can I help Hurricane Harvey and Houston flood victims?
In 1998 Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras. More than 11,000 people died. More than a million and a half were left homeless.
And Rilling got a wake-up call: ""Got a call from one of our logistics experts who said that a plane full of supplies could not land, because there was clothing on the runway. It's in boxes and bales. It takes up yards of space. It can't be moved.' 'Whose clothing is it?' He said, 'Well, I don't know whose it is, but there's a high-heeled shoe, just one, and a bale of winter coats.' And I thought, winter coats? It's summer in Honduras.""
Humanitarian workers call the crush of useless, often incomprehensible contributions ""the second disaster.""
In 2004, following the Indian Ocean tsunami, a beach in Indonesia was piled with used clothing.
There was no time for disaster workers to sort and clean old clothes. So the contributions just sat and rotted.
""This very quickly went toxic and had to be destroyed,"" said Rilling. ""And local officials poured gasoline on it and set it on fire. And then it was out to sea.""
""So, rather than clothing somebody, it went up in flames?"" asked Simon.
""Correct. The thinking is that these people have lost everything, so they must NEED everything. So people SEND everything. You know, any donation is crazy if it's not needed. People have donated prom gowns and wigs and tiger costumes and pumpkins, and frostbite cream to Rwanda, and used teabags, 'cause you can always get another cup of tea.""
You may not think that sending bottles of water to devastated people seems crazy. But Rilling points out, ""This water, it's about 100,000 liters, will provide drinking water for 40,000 people for one day. This amount of water to send from the United States, say, to West Africa -- and people did this -- costs about $300,000. But relief organizations with portable water purification units can produce the same amount, a 100,000 liters of water, for about $300.""
And then there were warm-hearted American women who wanted to send their breast milk to nursing mothers in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.
""It sounds wonderful, but in the midst of a crisis it's actually one of the most challenging things,"" said Rebecca Gustafson, a humanitarian aid expert who has worked on the ground after many disasters.
""Breast milk doesn't stay fresh for very long. And the challenge is, what happens if you do give it to an infant who then gets sick?""
December 2012, Newtown, Connecticut: A gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Almost instantaneously, stuff start arriving.
Chris Kelsey, who worked for Newtown at the time, said they had to get a warehouse to hold all the teddy bears.
Simon asked, ""Was there a need for teddy bears?""
""I think it was a nice gesture,"" Kelsey replied. ""There was a need to do something for the kids. There was a need to make people feel better. I think the wave of stuff we got was a little overwhelming.""
And how many teddy bear came to Newtown? ""I think it was about 67,000,"" Kelsey said. ""Wasn't limited to teddy bears. There was also thousands of boxes of school supplies, and thousands of boxes of toys, bicycles, sleds, clothes.""
Newtown had been struck by mass murder, not a tsunami. As Kelsey said, ""I think a lot of the stuff that came into the warehouse was more for the people that sent it, than it was for the people in Newtown. At least, that's the way it felt at the end.""
Every child in Newtown got a few bears. The rest had to be sent away, along with the bikes and blankets.
There are times when giving things works. More than 650,000 homes were destroyed or damaged in Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Thousands of people lost everything.
Tammy Shapiro is one of the organizers of Occupy Sandy, which grew out of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
""We were able to respond in a way that the big, bureaucratic agencies can't,"" Shapiro said.
When the hurricane struck, they had a network of activists, connected and waiting.
""Very quickly, we just stopped taking clothes,"" Shapiro said. Instead, they created a ""relief supply"" wedding registry.
""We put the items that we needed donated on that registry,"" said Shapiro. ""And then people who wanted to donate could buy the items that were needed. I mean, a lot of what we had on the wedding registry was diapers. They needed flashlights.""
Simon asked, ""How transportable is your experience here, following Hurricane Sandy?""
""For me, the network is key. Who has the knowledge? Where are spaces that goods can live if there's a disaster? Who's really well-connected on their blocks?""
Juanita Rilling's album of disaster images shows shot after shot of good intentions just spoiling in warehouses, or rotting on the landscape.
""It is heartbreaking,"" Rilling said. ""It's heartbreaking for the donor, it's heartbreaking for the relief organizations, and it's heartbreaking for survivors. This is why cash donations are so much more effective. They buy exactly what people need, when they need it.
""And cash donations enable relief organizations to purchase supplies locally, which ensures that they're fresh and familiar to survivors, purchased in just the right quantities, and delivered quickly. And those local purchases support the local merchants, which strengthens the local economy for the long run.""
Disaster response worker Rebecca Gustafson says that most people want to donate something that is theirs: ""Money sometimes doesn't feel personal enough for people. They don't feel enough of their heart and soul is in that donation, that check that they would send.
""The reality is, it's one of the most compassionate things that people can do.""",0
"Twenty-eight Europe-bound displaced people and transients were discovered dead on a day of distraught salvages off Libya on Tuesday, incorporating no less than 22 in an overburdened wooden watercraft, a picture taker and the Italian Coast Guard said. The picture taker, who could get onto the vessel, said it gave the idea that a hefty portion of the dead had choked.
He said there were in regards to 1,000 individuals on three levels. He tallied 22 bodies and said there were all the more dead in the hold. The coast protect — which is organizing salvage endeavors in universal waters north of Libya — said 28 bodies had been recuperated throughout 33 operations on Tuesday, while 4,655 displaced people and transients had been saved.
The picture taker was going on the Astral, a boat sanctioned by Spanish non-administrative association ProActiva Open Arms, which salvages evacuees and transients adrift. Late on Tuesday, the Italian Navy assumed control helping survivors and recovering bodies, the picture taker said. It was yet one more day of dramatization adrift after more than 6,000 individuals, a large portion of them Africans in pressed elastic dinghies, were saved off Libya on Monday. Nine bodies were found in those operations, including a pregnant lady.
With various salvage watercrafts on the way to Italy to empty the colossal human payload gathered on Monday, the Astral was allowed to sit unbothered to manage the overburden wooden watercraft for a few hours. The Astral was supported just by rafts dropped by a Spanish military plane until the Italian Navy landed at late morning. There was frenzy locally available, with individuals bouncing into the water, the picture taker said.
The Astral’s salvage operations had started before daybreak and kept going until sunset. The most recent individuals to be protected will add to a sum of around 132,000 evacuees and vagrants who have arrived at Italy’s southern ports so far this year, escaping struggle, destitution or abuse, and wanting to begin new lives in Europe. The fresh introductions are for the most part Africans who plan to attempt to get to northern Europe, yet progressively are obliged to look for haven or the privilege to stay in Italy, where gathering focuses have been strained to blasting point.",1
"Phase one of President Trump’s proposed border wall is complete.
Now comes the testing of the prototypes for their breach-ability — how long does it take someone to cut through, dig under or vault over the 30-foot-high structures.
“The thing I am most impressed by is the scale,” said Customs and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Ron Vitiello. “A lot of things have to happen now - testing, evaluation, estimates, appropriation. We will do it all as quickly and safely as we can to give as much security to the homelands as we can.”
He stressed the agency is not looking at a 2,000-mile wall across the border, as some critics still claim. Rather, portions of the wall will be erected where it is most efficient and topographically possible based on need and the ability to attain ‘operation control’, a term that first surfaced during the presidency of George W Bush.
Operational control is roughly defined as the ability to detect and follow anyone who crosses the border illegally, with a likelihood of capture.
The US-Mexican border is roughly 2,000-miles long. About 350 miles feature a fence capable of stopping or slowing down most pedestrians. Another 350 miles of barrier can only stop vehicles. The remaining portions of the border are either defined by the Rio Grande river, barb wire or no fence at all.
“The wall or fencing is one piece that is critical to border security, but it is not the answer itself,” said retired San Diego Border Patrol Sector Chief Rick Barlow. “One lesson we have learned over time here is the moment you put up a fence in one area, the areas you don’t have fencing instantly become open to vulnerability.”
San Diego has 46 miles of single fencing and 14 miles of double fencing, the kind the border patrol prefers, enabling agents to drive along the two fences and apprehend those who get over the first fence but are slowed down by the second.
“I have 32 years as a Border Patrol agent, in San Diego, Arizona and Texas,” says San Diego Division Chief Mario Villarreal.
“Every place I have worked we constructed a physical barrier on the border and every place we have erected tactical infrastructure, apprehensions have gone down.”
In 1986, San Diego peaked with 638,370 apprehensions. After completing a border fence, along with sensors, cameras and more manpower, apprehensions fell dramatically, to 31,891 last fiscal year.
But border agents fully expect human smugglers and drug cartels will test any new wall the agency erects, which is why the Department of Homeland Security will spend the next 30 to 60 days testing and evaluating the ability of the prototypes to withstand multiple tests involving hydraulic jacks, concrete saws, ramming vehicles, grappling hooks and ladders.
“They come across with everything,” Barlow said. “One person will come over with an ax, another with a Sawzall. They will hack a hole big enough for one person to get through. They will come with shovels to dig rat holes under the fence and ladders to latch on to the fence to get up and over.”
Four of the new prototypes are made with concrete, a new material for the Border Patrol. Four others are made with metal, concrete and other materials. All of them there 30 feet high and six-feet deep to prevent burrowing.
Vitiello said the agency is working as quickly as it can.
“We are doing everything we can to meet the mandate of operational control at the border and the president’s direction for a wall at the southern border.”
The acting commissioner stressed the agency may ultimately select more than one design or chose features from one or another and deploy the final design based on need, terrain and topography. How many miles are actually built is dependent on how much money Congress appropriates.",0
"Spain’s top central bankers have been hauled into court and are facing jail sentences after being charged with a lengthy rap sheet of criminal offenses against the people of their country.
Spanish authoritiesallege the central bankers encouraged the Spanish people to buy shares in a new bank they knew was guaranteed to fail – but which they also knew would be bailed out by the government and taxpayers.
This scheme made the central bankers a fortune twice over – while leaving the Spanish people out of pocket twice.
While central bankers around the world are generally considered to be above the law, Spanish authorities have unraveled this criminal enterprise and are determined to prosecute every banker involved, from the bottom right to the top.
At least 65 members of Bankia’s management team are facing jail time including its former President and ex-chief of the IMF, Rodrigo Rato, who personally faces charges of money laundering, tax fraud, and embezzlement.
By demanding that bankers be subject to the same laws as the rest of society, Spain is opting for a very different strategy in the wake of the financial crisis to rest of Europe and the US, where banks were fined nominal amounts, and directors and chief executives escaped punishment altogether.
WolfStreet report: As part of the epic, multi-year criminal investigation into the doomed IPO of Spain’s frankenbank Bankia – which had been assembled from the festering corpses of seven already defunct saving banks – Spain’s national court called to testify six current and former directors of the Bank of Spain, including its former governor, Miguel ngel Fernández Ordóez, and its former deputy governor (and current head of the Bank of International Settlements’ Financial Stability Institute), Fernando Restoy.
It also summoned for questioning Julio Segura, the former president of Spain’s financial markets regulator, the CNMV (the Spanish equivalent of the SEC in the US).
The six central bankers and one financial regulator stand accused of authorizing the public launch of Bankia in 2011 despite repeated warnings from the Bank of Spain’s own team of inspectors that the banking group was “unviable.”
Though they have so far only been called to testify, the evidence against the seven former public “servants” looks pretty conclusive. Testifying against them are two of Banco de Espaa’s own inspectors who have spent the last two years investigating Bankia’s collapse on behalf of the trial’s presiding judge, Fernando Andreu.
There are also four emails from the Bank of Spain’s inspector in charge of overseeing Bankia’s IPO, José Antonio Casaus, to the assistant director general of supervision at the Bank of Spain, Pedro Comín, that very clearly express concerns about the bank’s “serious and growing” profitability, liquidity, and solvency issues.
Here are four brief excerpts:
[April 8, 2011] “Bankia is unviable, both economically and financially. In the end, the FROB [Spain’s state-owned Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring] will have to convert its debt into shares for the BFA [Spain’s state-owned banking group] and refund holders of Bankia’s subordinate bonds and “preferentes” shares. […] Find a buyer for the group.”
[April 14,2011] “This is not working, it’s getting worse. […] Bankia’s capacity to generate resources is deteriorating.”
[May 10, 2011, uppercase used by Causus for emphasis] “The endogenous solution put forward by Bankia — a public listing with a double banking structure without the necessary structural changes — WILL NOT WORK AND WILL HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON TAXPAYERS.”
[May 16, 2011, 2 months before the IPO] “The (bank’s) board is highly politicized and unprofessional. It still has the same directors that led the former entities to need public assistance: [they are] discredited in the eyes of the markets.”
As the court’s edict reads, the contents of the emails unequivocally demonstrate that the Bank of Spain’s management was perfectly aware of the “inviability of the group” as well as “the fabricated financial results it had presented.” Yet, together with the CNMV, it lent its blessing to those results, knowing full well they bore no relation to reality .
Featured in the IPO prospectus, those results were crucial in luring 360,000 credulous investors into buying shares in the soon-to-be-bankrupt bank, not to mention the 238,000 people who bought “preferentes” shares or other forms of high-risk subordinate debt instruments being peddled by Bankia’s sales teams as “perfectly safe investments.” Most have since been refunded by Spanish taxpayers.
The IPO prospectus was also signed off on by Bankia’s auditor, Deloitte, whose Spanish representatives are also warming the defendants’ bench. Deloitte was not just the bank’s auditor, it was also the consultant responsible for formulating its accounts. As El Mundo put it, first Deloitte built Bankia’s balances, then it audited them, in complete contravention of the basic concept of auditor independence [read: Deloitte About to Pay for its Spanish Sins?].
Given this deeply compromising, not to say illegal, set-up, it’s hardly any surprise that Deloitte was happy to confirm in Bankia’s IPO prospectus that the newly born frankenbank was in sound financial health, having made a handsome profit of 300 million just before its public launch. It was a blatant lie: in reality Bankia was bleeding losses from every orifice.
Now, just about everybody who played a role in this momentous deception, with the exception of the government itself, is standing trial. That includes 65 former members of Bankia’s management team including its former President and ex-chief of the IMF, Rodrigo Rato, who faces charges of money laundering, tax fraud, and embezzlement.
In his testimony to the court almost exactly two years ago, Rato argued (quite rightly) that the blame for Bankia’s collapse should be much more evenly spread out. Bankia’s public launch “was not a whimsical decision” taken by its chief executives, he said, but was the inevitable result of regulatory changes at the beginning of 2011. According to Rato, the CNMV even played an active role in drawing up the bank’s lie-infested IPO brochure.
Now, two years later, some of the most senior central bankers in Spain find themselves in the rare position of having to explain and defend the actions and decisions they took that helped pave the way to the biggest bank bailout in Spanish history. It will be one of the first times that senior members of the global central banking complex have had to face trial for the consequences of their actions.",1

The retail behemoth feels at home in Seattle. But the city's not so sure.
SEATTLE—There’s a scene in the pilot of HBO’s “Silicon Valley” when tech czar Gavin Belson is looking out his office window, watching his minions walk across campus.
“It’s weird,” Belson says to his hovering, fawning life coach. “They always travel in groups of five, these programmers. There’s always a tall, skinny white guy; short skinny Asian guy; fat guy with a ponytail; some guy with crazy facial hair and then, an East Indian guy. It’s like they trade guys until they all have the right group.”
That scene plays out every day in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood, where Jeff Bezos’ ever-growing army of Amazon employees have taken over several city blocks, turning this City by the Sound into a new kind of Company Town.
It’s a moniker that Seattle has embraced before—company town—as far back as the Klondike Gold Rush, and in the last several decades as the home of Boeing, Microsoft and Starbucks. In the case of Amazon, though, that civic embrace hasn’t been given as quickly, or as easily. The city simply can’t get its arms all the way around it.
It was as if one day, Seattle woke up to find that 30,000 new neighbors had moved in, with all the attendant headaches you can imagine: traffic jams, housing shortages and soaring rents. There’s a new, laissez-faire working culture of dressing down and dogs at your desk. Buses are so loaded with so-called “Am-holes” that they rush past stops. Even the dating scene is feeling the rising tide of well-paid, educated men in boyish jeans, sneakers and T-shirts who would rather talk code than meet cute.
Amazon has 15,000 employees in Seattle—most of them engineers, managers and programmers—out of a global workforce of 97,000 and it’s building two new towers in Seattle for another 12,000 workers. The company’s growth and imprint on the city is driven home every time the U. S. Census releases new findings and Seattle shudders at reaching a new milestone it didn’t anticipate, or maybe even want. In the last year, Seattle has experienced the steepest rent hike among U.S. cities. Three out of five Seattle apartments now rent for more than $1,000. To meet demand, whole neighborhoods are seemingly under siege. New construction has bled beyond the tech epicenter of South Lake Union, and up the city’s hills to hipster hamlets where families, non-tech workers and the gay and lesbian community have lived for years, and are now feeling squeezed and priced out.
How Republicans Became More Conservative Than the Pope
Amazon’s is not only a global workforce, pulling workers from all continents, but one of mostly men: Seventy-five percent of Amazon’s workforce is male, to be exact. Their numbers—and their arrival over the last two years—seem to have affected the median income of men in the city. Recent census data showed that median earnings for Seattle men who work full-time increased by $7,000 between 2012 and 2013—a 7 percent jump in just one year. That ranks as the highest pay raise for men in any major U.S. city, and puts men’s median earnings in Seattle at $67,000. Those employed in tech had a median pay of $91,000 last year, and were 79 percent male.
Meanwhile, median earnings for women who work full-time in Seattle only went up one percent, census data shows, plateauing at $52,000. Women in Seattle, according to the data, make just 78 cents for every dollar earned by men. That’s down from 86 cents in 2012. So much for progress.
That eight-cent drop represents the largest one-year widening of the gender pay gap among major U.S. cities, and tied Seattle with Tulsa, Okla., as the fifth-worst pay gap in the country in 2013. The best anyone could do at the City Council level was authorize an “action plan” to address the imbalance.
The one area where women would seem to have the upper hand thanks largely to Amazon is in dating. Based on 2010 census numbers crunched by tech writer Jeff Reifman, Seattle has 130 single men for every 100 single women. Reifman, in an article titled “You’ve Got Male: Amazon’s Growth Impacting Seattle Dating Scene,” estimated that by the end of 2014, there will be 86,098 single males aged 25 to 44, but only 66,273 females in the same age range. “If you’re a straight, single woman outside of Seattle,” he wrote, “this might be a great time to move here. Seriously, please move here. Amazon’s hiring.”
But, to use a phrase coined by the women of Georgia Tech, “The odds are good, but the goods are odd.” In a piece for the website Dame titled “Amazon is Killing My Sex Life,” Tricia Romano recounted her dates with “brogrammers”—men with fat wallets, cool shades and ripped abs but slim interest in anything beyond their jobs and themselves.
“I spent a half hour or more listening to him talk about his job,” Romano wrote in the piece, which ran last spring. “Since I am not in the tech industry, I don’t understand any of it. It was all job speak—the type of language ladder-climbers use; it was the kind of talk that shuts vaginas down cold.”
Seattle’s relationship with other companies that once defined this company town hasn’t always been smooth, although those organizations eventually settled into the community and grew without uprooting those who came before it.
Boeing was started in 1910, when William Boeing bought a shipyard along the Duwamish River and turned it into an airplane factory. By 1967, it had 100,000 employees.

How the Right Gets Reagan Wrong
A reported series from Politico Magazine, featuring innovative ideas from cities across the United States at a time of unprecedented urban reinvention.",0
"When Rothschild issued his famous decree, “Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makes it’s laws”, it was not fully understood at the time what this would entail for the Western world. But hundreds of years later, these ominous words have come to pass and the private banking cabal has nearly achieved its goal of complete and total control over the economic, financial, and political policies of half the world.
But what exactly does it mean to have control over economic and political policies? Charles Hugh-Smith wrote on this recently, and stated that politicians now are afraid to pass any legislation that might impede the progress and profitability of banks, corporations, and markets, and in doing so has put restrictions on the people, not the banks, when events lead towards crises, insolvency, or collapse.
Recently, France decided to crack down on those people who make cash payments and withdrawals and who hold small bank accounts. The reason given was, not surprisingly, to “fight terrorism,” the handy catchall justification for any new restriction governments wish to impose on their citizens. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin stated at the time, “[T]errorism feeds on fraud, money laundering, and petty trafficking.”
And so, in future, people in France will not be allowed to make cash payments exceeding 1,000 (down from 3,000). Additionally, cash deposits and withdrawals totaling more than 10,000 per month will be reported to Tracfin—an anti-fraud and money laundering agency.
Currency exchange will also be further restricted. Anyone changing over 1,000 to another currency (down from 8,000) will be required to show an identity card.
And France is not alone. In the US, federal law requires banks to file a “suspicious activity report” (SAR) on their customers whenever a customer requests a suspicious transaction. (In 2013, 1.6 million SAR’s were submitted.)
As to what may be deemed “suspicious,” it may be any transaction of $5,000 or more, but it may also mean a series of transactions that, together, exceed $5,000.
The reader may be saying to himself, “But that’s just normal, everyday banking business—that means anybody, any time, could be reported.” If so, he would be correct. Essentially, any banking activity the reader conducts could be regarded as suspect.
In Italy, in 2011, Prime Minister Mario Monti began working to end the right of landlords, tradesmen, and small businesses to perform large transactions in cash, which critics say help them evade taxation. In December of that year, his government reduced the maximum allowed cash payment from 2,500 euros to 1,000.
Spain has outlawed cash transactions over 2,500. The justification? “To crack down on the black market and tax evaders.”
In Sweden, the country where the first banknote was created in 1661, the use of cash is being steadily eliminated. Increasingly, expenses are paid and purchases made by cellphone text message, and many banks have stopped handling cash altogether.
Denmark’s central bank, Nationalbanken, has another justification for ending its use of banknotes—producing paper money and coinage is not cost effective.
Israel also seeks to end the use of cash. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s chief of staff has announced a three-phase plan to “all but do away with cash transactions in Israel.”
Individuals and businesses would initially continue to be allowed to make small cash transactions, but eventually, all transactions would be converted to electronic forms of payment. The justification being used in Israel is that “cash is bad,” because it encourages an underground economy and enables tax evasion.
Across the Atlantic, banks and governments are on a similar campaign. A 2012 law inMexico bans large cash transactions, with a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
In August 2014, Uruguay passed the Financial Inclusion Law, which limits cash transactions to US$5,000. In future, all transactions over that amount will be required to be performed electronically. The crying need for such a law? The stated reason was to improve the country’s credit ratings. – Jeff Thomas, Doug Casey’s International Man Blog
Added to this is J. P. Morgan’s new policy for their customers which no longer allows them to store cash in safety deposit boxes, or use the deemed legal tender to pay on debt obligations such as auto loans, mortgages, etc….
As we have seen recently with the former First Lady and former Secretary of State, politicians are simply servants available to the highest bidder, and for the right price will always implement policies and legislation to accommodate the elite, the banks, and the corporations. And with the SEC and CFTC refusing to even acknowledge the power and control that HFT computers have over the entire stock, bond, and forex markets, the people in the West are now slaves themselves to the banks, and no rule of law remains that will protect the citizens from the dictatorship of these entities.

"It is jobs day in America.
On Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, the BLS will release the December jobs report, the final report of 2016 (and also the first report of 2017, depending on how you see it).
Economists are looking for nonfarm payrolls to grow by 175,000 in December, which would be slightly less than the 178,000 we saw in November. This would, however, be enough to push yearly job gains over 2 million for the third-straight year.
The unemployment rate is expected to tick up slightly to 4.7% from 4.6%, while average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3% month-on-month after a 0.1% decline in November.
Compared to the prior year, average hourly earnings are expected to rise 2.8%, which would match the post-crisis high we hit back in October.
Later on Friday morning we’ll also get the November reading on factory orders and the final reading on November’s durable goods figures.
We forecast that nonfarm payroll employment increased 180k in December, after an increase of 178k in November and 142k in October. On balance, labor market indicators were moderately strong in December, with improvement in the employment components of many service-sector and manufacturing surveys and a rise in consumer confidence to a 15-year high.
The key labor market subcomponent of consumer confidence also hovered near its post-crisis high, despite a modest pullback from November. We also expect above-trend payroll growth in the transportation and warehousing industry, driven by elevated hiring related to strong online holiday shopping.
On the negative side, initial jobless claims drifted higher and continuing claims posted the largest survey-week-to-survey-week increase in nearly a year. December’s relatively cold payroll survey week could also constrain payroll growth in weather-sensitive industries such as construction, particularly after the warmer-than-usual November. We do not expect the end of the election to be a major factor this month.
And while Hill and the team at Goldman do not see the election being a major factor in December’s report, he added that industry-specific readings  — potentially in energy, financial services, or healthcare — could show signs of an impact from the election.
In an afternoon tweet, President-elect Donald Trump said, “Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U. S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.”
Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U. S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.
Toyota’s plans to open a factory in Guanajuato — not Baja — Mexico, however, would take jobs from a factory in Canada. In a statement, the company said that it, “looks forward to collaborating with the Trump administration to serve in the best interests of consumers and the automotive industry.”
This sentiment is mostly similar to what we heard from General Motors (GM) earlier this week after Trump attacked the company for plans to move a small portion of production to Mexico.
But consider what else happened this week in the automotive space: Ford (F) scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and instead build cars at an existing factory in Mexico and also invest $700 million at a plant in Michigan. So, the company will still build cars in Mexico, it just won’t make a new factory to do it.
The Michigan investment will see Ford create 700 jobs, almost nothing for a company that employs nearly 200,000 people. No amount of investment of job creation or loss, however, seems too small for Trump to target or attack.
And while it remains to be seen if GM and Toyota have more to say following Trump’s tweets, it seems clear that other companies will find themselves in Trump’s crosshairs. And they’ll probably find out on Twitter.",1
"Over 37,000 people die in the U. S. in car accidents a year and 2.35 million are injured. Car accidents kill more people than guns do yearly. So I’m gonna go a little off topic and say, this doesn’t mean that we outlaw cars right?
irresponsible people and criminals using cars, kill people. Cars themselves don’t get up and kill people. So if an irresponsible criminal with a gun kills someone do we outlaw guns? Say it with me class… NO.

"NO QUALIFICATION so defines a business school as its MBA. Think of the average Wharton, London Business School or INSEAD student and you will probably picture a man (correctly, sadly) in his late 20s, already well on his way to becoming a corporate titan. MBA students, who must usually have several years’ management experience before signing up at business school, happily pay well over $100,000 to gain a degree that they expect will launch them to the next level of their stellar careers.
Such an impression is only half right. In fact, often the most sought after post-graduate business degrees, particularly in Europe, are not MBAs, but Masters in Management (MiMs). At ESSEC, a grande ecole near Paris, for example, 83 students enrolled on the last MBA course. Some 806 joined its MiM. At Durham Business School in Britain, MiMs outnumber MBAs nearly four-to-one.
Masters in Management degrees cover nearly all of the same academic ground as their posher cousins. But instead of recruiting people who have already been working for years, MiM students tend to join programmes straight from their undergraduate degrees. Students who study an MBA at a school ranked by The Economist typically have six years’ work experience. Those listed on our inaugural MiM ranking have less than 18 months’.
Some sniff at this. The mantra of the MBA is that students learn as much from each other as they do from the professors. Only when a classroom is full of experienced engineers, entrepreneurs and economists is this possible. That may be true, but it misses the point of taking a MiM. Students taking a Master’s in Management are generally on a different track. While MBA students tend to be at the stage of their career when they are looking to swap from a specialist role to a general management one, MiM students are looking to gain the business skills to land their first jobs. “Students choose a first degree in a subject they are interested in,” says Susan Hart, dean of Durham Business School, “then take a MiM to monetise it.”
That means that, when they graduate, MiM students start on a lower corporate rung. At management consultants, for example, they will typically join at associate level, whereas MBAs join as full consultants. That is reflected in their starting salary. At HEC Paris, our top-ranked MiM programme, graduates can expect to earn an average basic salary of around $60,000 on leaving the programme. That is around half what their counterparts on the school’s MBA programme rake in.
That, however, does not take into account the difference in the opportunity cost. Tuition for HEC’s MiM programme is 25,900 ($29,100) compared with 62,000 for its MBA. What is more, that experienced MBA student will have forgone an average $73,000 of salary while attending campus, far more than his MiM counterpart might have expected, had he gone straight into employment after his undergraduate degree.
Furthermore, although there has been little research into the long-term career trajectory of MiM graduates, it is possible that, over time, the earning power of both degrees converges. MBAs lose two years’ employment to study in their late 20s. MiMs can work straight through from their early 20s. By the time they reach their 30s, thinks Bill Boulding, dean of the Fuqua school at Duke University in North Carolina, MBAs and MiMs will be earning roughly the same amount. It is just that MiMs front-load their education.
The MiM is still mainly European qualification. Of the 40 programmes ranked by The Economist, just ten are based outside the continent. Mr Boulding says, for example, that it can be difficult to explain to American firms, which are so used to recruiting MBAs, what the MiM is. That will change though. Well-regarded American institutions, such as Fuqua and the Kellogg School of Management, have already begun to offer their own programmes (both institutions declined to take part in our ranking.)
There is another reason to hope that they succeed. MIMs attract more women, possibly because MBA students are at the age at which many take time out of their careers to start a family. The average proportion of women on an Economist-ranked MiM course is 46%, compared with just 36% on MBAs. Few who have experienced the alpha-male atmosphere of the average MBA classroom would disagree that changing the balance of the sexes at business school would be a good thing.",0
"Monarch Airlines has ceased trading and all its future flights and holidays have been cancelled, affecting hundreds of thousands of customers.
About 860,000 people have lost bookings and more than 30 planes will be sent by the Civil Aviation Authority to return 110,000 holidaymakers who are overseas.
Monarch employs about 2,100 people and reported a 291m loss last year.
Terror attacks in Tunisia and Egypt, increased competition, and the weak pound have been blamed for its demise.
Theresa May's official spokesman said the prime minister ""feels hugely sorry"" for those affected by a ""very distressing situation"".
Monarch - the UK's fifth biggest and the country's largest ever to collapse - was placed in administration at 04:00 BST - a time when the airline had no planes in the air.
Passengers were then sent text messages informing them flights had been cancelled - but some customers were already at airports.
Alan Jee was due to get married in Gran Canaria on Saturday and arrived at Gatwick airport with 30 members of his family.
""I have spent 12,000 on my wedding and now I can't even go and get married,"" he said. ""I am gutted, absolutely gutted, and my missus is in tears, an emotional wreck.""
John Shepherd, from Tamworth, had been due to fly to Cyprus on Tuesday with his 92-year-old father.
He said they had already managed to book flights on another airline - costing a ""fair bit of money"", but he added: ""I'm worried we've lost all the money on the flights.""
Customers in the UK yet to travel: Don't go to the airport, the CAA says
Customers abroad: Everyone due to fly in the next fortnight will be brought back to the UK at no cost to them. There is no need to cut short a stay. Those with flight-only bookings after 16 October are unlikely to have Atol scheme protection, so will need to make their own arrangements
Customers currently overseas should check monarch.caa.co.uk for confirmation of their new flight details - which will be available a minimum of 48 hours in advance of their original departure time
All affected customers should keep checking monarch.caa.co.uk for more information
* The CAA also has a 24-hour helpline: 0300 303 2800 from the UK and Ireland and +44 1753 330330 from overseas
Monarch reported a loss of 291m for the year to October 2016, compared with a profit of 27m for the previous 12 months, after revenues slumped.
It had been in last-ditch talks with the CAA about renewing its licence to sell package holidays, but failed to reach a deal.
Blair Nimmo, from administrator KPMG, said its collapse was a result of ""depressed prices"" in the short-haul travel market, alongside increased fuel costs and handling charges as a result of a weak pound.
However, Monarch chief executive Andrew Swaffield said the ""root cause"" was terrorism in Egypt and Tunisia, as well as the collapse of the market in Turkey.
He said it had been carrying 14% more passengers than last year - but for 100m less revenue.
Mr Swaffield said employees could ""hold your heads up high and be proud of what you achieved"".
Monarch's owner, Greybull Capital, had been trying to sell part or all of its short-haul operation so it could focus on more profitable long-haul routes, and said it was ""very sorry"" it had not been able to turn around its fortunes.
The CAA has organised 34 chartered planes from 16 different airlines - EasyJet and Qatar Airways among them - to return passengers to the UK over the next fortnight.
Chief executive Andrew Haines said passengers would not be charged for the repatriation flights, which would match Monarch's original schedule ""as closely as possible"", adding: ""There will undoubtedly be some disruption"".
He said ""the nature of administration"" meant Monarch's fleet was not immediately available for use.
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling described the process of returning holidaymakers as the ""biggest peacetime repatriation"" effort.
""This is a hugely distressing situation for British holidaymakers abroad - and my first priority is to help them get back to the UK,"" he said.
Mr Grayling said the Department for Work and Pensions would give support to those affected and that airlines had already told him they may seek to employ Monarch staff.
EasyJet said it would be ""really pleased"" to hire former Monarch employees, saying it had 400 cabin crew vacancies at Gatwick Airport and 100 at Luton, as well as job openings for pilots and head office staff.
Last year, Monarch carried 6.3 million passengers to 40 destinations from Gatwick, Luton, Birmingham, Leeds-Bradford and Manchester airports.
According to the CAA, the 110,000 holidaymakers currently overseas are in at least 11 countries, including Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece.
Replacement flights are currently scheduled to fly to 33 airports.
Two ""rescue flights"" from Ibiza have already landed at Gatwick, the CAA said. The vast majority of customers due to fly on Monday are expected return by the end of the day.

"Drug approved by FDA weeks ahead of schedule for deadly cancer
Novartis Breakthrough May Herald New Era of Cures
The approval of Novartis AG’s breakthrough therapy for a deadly form of leukemia opened the door to a new class of treatments even asits $475,000 price tag reignited the debate on how to value potentially life-saving drugs. Demonstrating its willingness to clear medicines faster, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved a radical new one-time treatment from the Swiss drugmaker, weeks earlier than expected. The move heralds acceptance of a promising, potentially curative approach for cancers, genetic diseases and other severe disorders.“We’re entering a new frontier in medical innovation with the ability to reprogram a patient’s own cells to attack a deadly cancer,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said.
The therapies, known as CAR-T, raise a host of questions for doctors, patients, manufacturers and regulators, including who will receive the treatments and how to pay for them. Novartis is attempting to address the pricing question with a new type of agreement: for patients whose care is covered by U.S. government programs, the company will only get paid if patients show signs that the treatment is working within a month of getting it.“This will support sustainability of the health-care system and patient access while allowing a return on our investment,” Bruno Strigini, chief executive officer of oncology for Novartis, said on a call.The Basel, Switzerland-based company is wading into a new arena of performance-based pricing, said Sam Fazeli, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.“We’re not used to drugs curing people” of major diseases like cancer, he said. “It’s a paradigm shift.”Shares of Novartis rose 0.8 percent to 79.85 Swiss francs as of 10:07 a.m. in Zurich trading. The stock has advanced 7.7 percent in the past year.
The U.S. health-care system has grappled with the pricing issue before. In 2013, Gilead Science Inc. introduced an $84,000 cure for the viral disease hepatitis C, prompting a nationwide debate over drug costs. And new cancer treatments that have greatly extended some patients’ lives can cost $150,000 a year.Yet the almost half-million-dollar price tag on the Novartis CAR-T drug is a new benchmark, and more are likely to follow, with similar new therapies for blindness, blood disorders and other cancers. Spark Therapeutics Inc.’s gene therapy for a genetic disorder that causes childhood blindness is expected to get an agency decision by January.There are more than 600 gene and cell therapies in clinical trials today, according to Mark Trusheim, a strategic director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Biomedical Innovation. Those that make it to approval are likely to come with similar costs, in part because of the complex manufacturing process required to make these treatments.“Gene therapies are different because you’re treated once and then you’re done, as compared to regular drugs where you take them every month or every day,” Trusheim said. “There’s no mechanism for the developer to get paid every month, so the price points start to look pretty high.” He called Novartis’s arrangement to pay only if patients respond to the drug a “huge breakthrough.”Others,like Peter Bach, director of Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, see the industry’s prices creeping higher and higher with no end in sight.“We have gotten so comfortable with these numbers that are just beyond belief for these agents. And this is a highly profitable sector,” said Bach, who studies drug prices. “They just continue to move the goal posts” about what is reasonable.Part of the speed of the approvals is the agency trying to keep pace with science.“We have real innovation coming out of our industry,” said John Maraganore, a biotech CEO who chairs the trade organization Biotechnology Innovation Organization. “They aren’t incremental types of drugs.” He also said that the quality of drugs is improving, which is making it easier for the FDA to say yes.Cancer Immunotherapy Offers New Promise but Peril Too: QuickTakeFor example, in March, Tesaro Inc.’s cancer drug was approved three months ahead of the agency’s deadline, at a price of more than $100,000 a year. Kite Pharma Inc., which Gilead agreed to buy for $11.9 billion just this week, has a CAR-T therapy with a Nov. 29 deadline but has said it can be ready to start selling the medicine as soon as next month. It’s likely to come with a similar cost to the Novartis drug.The pace is also being driven by a five-year-old program at the FDA to get promising drugs through quickly, said Ellen Sigal, chairwoman of the advocacy group Friends of Cancer Research. Known as the breakthrough therapy program, the FDA initiative gives drugmakers more access to agency staff to help design clinical studies that will meet its standards.“It changed the culture,” Sigal said. “Now, if developers understand the patients that will benefit, they know how to design these trials.”While the approvals are coming faster, the process is also putting more of the onus onto doctors to assess how well the drugs actually work, said Bach.“To the extent there’s full data available, what it tells me is at the FDA, the effectiveness bar is being lowered,” Bach said, who doesn’t think safety standards are being lowered in turn. “They’re expecting us to more and more make the calls on the data, which is okay.”The Novartis drug, which will be sold under the name Kymriah, was approved on the condition that the drugmaker continue to track the patients who get it for another 15 years. At first, it will be used to treat children and young adults up to age 25 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, who don’t respond to traditional treatment or who are suffering from a second relapse.About 3,100 Americans age 20 and younger are diagnosed with ALL each year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Of those, about 600 patients whose disease relapses or doesn’t respond will be eligible for the Novartis treatment, according to the company. The Basel-based drugmaker will work to expand its use to more patients.“We’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Stephan Grupp, director of the cancer immunotherapy frontier program atChildren’s Hospital of Philadelphia, the first medical center to study Kymriah in children. “This therapy may become the new standard of care for this patient population.”— With assistance by Michelle Cortez, and Jared S Hopkins

Bob McCann (left) works with his only employee, Cecil Lucas,at Iron Gate Antiques. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)   Choose a job you love, the saying goes, and you will never have to work a day in your life. Even billionaire Warren Buffett says he happily “tap dances” to the office because he so much enjoys what he does. Bob McCann doesn’t tap dance to his business, which specializes in restoring antiques, clocks and furniture, but the decorated and retired Marine probably would were his shop, located in a former sawmill, not a seven-mile drive from home. Many of us in our 60s are looking for a post-retirement calling to keep us sharp. McCann, 65, has found it. He considers himself lucky because he gets to make people happy, stays busy and earns a little money doing it. “This is a labor of love,” said the owner of Iron Gate Antiques, located in well-heeled Loudoun County, Va.  [Forget passion. This tutoring business grew out of a mother’s desperation]  “I’m not making money, but I’m not losing money.” Iron Gate has grossed about $1.5 million or so in the last 10 years, enough to put a couple thousand dollars a month in McCann’s bank account after expenses. He doesn’t need the money. He collects a $55,000 annual pension for his 26 active years in the Marine Corps, and afterward had a top-paying technology career. His wife has a good job in the defense sector. This is a guy who wakes up thankful every day. Three decades ago, he barely survived an accident that killed several shipmates and left a two-inch hole through his leg.   And now he’s thankful that he has survived long enough to indulge his affection for old and well-made objects. “The best part is the joy of working with my hands and watching the satisfaction on people’s faces when they see the finished product,” McCann said. One client, he recalled, brought him a small maple desk. “I took the blanket off it and she just started bawling,” McCann said. “She said, ‘It looks the way it was when I was little and it brings back so many memories.’” I know the feeling. I recently spent a considerable sum to restore an antique, wooden Singer sewing machine cabinet that included the iron foot pedal that my mother pumped to make the needle bob. My eyes well up every time I look at that piece and think of my mom, sitting in the dining room, working at that sewing machine when I was a kid in Syracuse. People like me make McCann’s little boutique go. We pay through the nose for the memories housed in those pieces of furniture. Loudoun County’s median household income is one of the highest in the United States, and some of those clients are millionaires from Virginia horse country and beyond, but some are average Joes.  [Here’s how to get your video footage into a TV show or movie]  “I do have wealthy clients but I have some middle-of-the-road people, too,” he said. McCann charges by the job. He works like mad, arriving between 8:30 and 9 a.m. Monday through Saturday and leaving around 6:30 p.m. He also works from noon to 5 p.m. most Sundays. McCann bought Iron Gate, including its 600-name trove of customer data, for $20,000 in 2007 after its previous owner died. He inherited one employee, who earns “a whopping $15 an hour.” McCann doesn’t pay himself a salary, but Iron Gate’s profit comes to about $12 for every hour he works. He rents space for about $1,900 a month, including utilities. The business is on track to gross about $140,000 this year. McCann said he gets a lot of business because of his expertise in the dying art of “seat caning and rush seating.” That’s another way of saying he can fix chairs that most others can’t. As we spoke, he had 26 chairs stacked in his office awaiting repair from across the Washington area.
Bob McCann demonstrates his skill at ‘seat caning and rush seating.’ ( Katherine Frey /The Washington Post)  Like most professional services businesses, the trick is in estimating the cost of the jobs. Each year, he takes on about 200 repairs, each of which can take hours, days, weeks or more; one curved bench that he caned took four months. So he needs to get those estimates right. His most expensive job involved the restoration of 18 pieces of smoke-damaged furniture that a woman had inherited from her great aunt. McCann billed the client $20,000, netting him about $3,000 — or about a 15 percent return.  [She gave up $100,000 a year job in banking for this: ‘World chocolate domination’]  “The key is being able to look through the piece to determine how much it’s really going to cost to restore,” said McCann. “It’s rare for me to lose money. We have done hundreds of pieces, probably 2,000 since I bought the business. I have lost money on maybe two. I just eyeballed them wrong.” He works on chairs, cradles, sewing machines. He took one old pump organ and converted it into a desk. The mainstay of Iron Gate is client work, but it’s not the entire business. McCann trolls auctions and antique dealers for artifacts he can restore and sell at retail in his shop. He bought a set of six chairs from the 18th century, made of bird’s-eye maple, at an auction in nearby Culpepper for $30. He is asking $1,000 for the lot. McCann learned his woodworking skills growing up in Oxford, Ohio, where his father was an electrician and the family lived in an old house. “He was always fixing furniture,” McCann said of his dad. “And I had a knack for it.” In 1970, he dropped out of college after one semester (“it was boring”) and joined the Marines. That was pretty risky back then, because the Vietnam War was still going strong. The Marines trained him to operate mortars, which fire shells at high angles to drop them on nearby enemy positions. Most of his basic training class went to Vietnam, but McCann ended up aboard the aircraft carrier USS Independence, where he served as a bodyguard to the ship’s captain. After a year, he moved to London, where he guarded Navy personnel. Selected for an officers’ program in 1976, he was sent to Texas A&M University. He graduated in 1979 with a degree in management, and was promoted to second lieutenant. He eventually became an aircraft maintenance officer in charge of 130 men on the supercarrier USS Nimitz. McCann’s team was tasked with making sure several of the ship’s aircraft were in working order.  That’s where he had a life-changing experience. During training exercises off the coast of Florida — 24-hour operations involving live, .50-caliber ammunition, as well as Sidewinder and Sparrow missiles — a plane crashed while trying to land on the carrier’s flight deck one night around midnight, setting off a blistering fire that ignited the live ammunition and rockets. Fourteen men were killed, including two standing near McCann. Forty-eight more were injured. “We were standing, putting out fires, and an explosion occurred 10 feet away,” McCann said. A missile blew, killing two servicemen who were holding a fire hose with McCann and sending a piece of shrapnel tearing through his calf. “The angle I was facing was what saved me,” he said. “Any other angle, and I would have lost my leg.” McCann was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, which is the highest peacetime award for heroism. His recovery took six weeks. After he finished his deployment aboard the Nimitz he was stationed in Norfolk, where he ran the Navy’s version of the Federal Aviation Administration.  [How a little Capitol Hill kitchen store survives in the age of Amazon]  He retired from the Marines in 1996. Then he earned up to $200,000 a year working for private technology companies around Washington. He took a year off in his mid-50s to care for his son while his wife attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then he bought Iron Gate in 2007. McCann said that Iron Gate really isn’t about profit. It’s about doing something you love and making the most of every day. We all should have that feeling. Not surprisingly, he has never forgotten that night aboard the Nimitz. “Before the Nimitz, I was a ramrod straight, by-the-book Marine Corps officer. After almost dying during the fire, my attitude changed. I started enjoying life. Now, I have fun all day long. Neighbors even complain that my laughing at work is too loud.”   To the average investor, Puerto Rico debt crash is more whimper, less bang    Is bitcoin another tulip craze or a legitimate investment?

"Ferrari NVsold out a $2.1 million open-top version of its LaFerrari supercar before its public debut, underscoring the marque’s allure even as the former unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV widens its line-up with more affordable models.
That two-pronged strategy was on display at the Paris Motor Show on Thursday. At one end of the scale, the Italian sports-car maker teased visitors with the aura of the LaFerrari Aperta, which is limited to 200 vehicles and was so sought-after that a collector sued for being left off the buyer’s list. At the other end is the four-seat GTC4 Lusso T, equipped with a smaller V8 motor instead of the standard V12.
“For us a limited edition is a way to reward our clients,” Ferrari’s head of sales and marketing Enrico Galliera said at the Paris unveilings. The Lusso, meanwhile, is meant to fill a market gap. “There were a number of clients that were looking for something different. They were looking for the same emotion of driving a Ferrari-- which is sporty and versatile -- but at the same time is specifically designed to be driven every day.”
Ferrari has been under pressure to show that its strategy of wooing the world’s elite can work without the backing of a bigger player. The automaker’s stock has been below the initial public offering price of $52 a share since November, and its ambition to broaden the brand beyond exotic cars and challenge luxury icons such as Hermes and Louis Vuitton has failed to make headway.
For more news from the Paris Motor Show, click here.
That puts the focus on Ferrari’s cars to fuel profit growth, which means safeguarding exclusivity with limited-run models such as the Aperta while gradually pushing up volumes with the likes of the 233,000-euro ($261,000) GTC4 Lusso T. The company has a target to increase overall production to 9,000 cars annually by 2019 from about 8,000 now.
“The equity story of Ferrari is not yet fully known,” said Massimo Vecchio, an analyst at Mediobanca. “The company continues to show visibility, resiliency andprice power.”
That’s helped the stock erase most of its losses after hitting a low of $32 in the wake of the October initial public offering in New York. The shares have been trading close to $50 for most of this month. In Milan, Ferrari’s shares rose as much as 1.7 percent to 46.23 euros, the highest since the European listing there in January.
Demand for the new LaFerrari Aperta, whose engine is derived from Ferrari’s Formula 1 race cars, shows how the brand still excites aficionados, including celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay who is one of the buyers.
Ferrari will be keeping nine of the Aperta, which costs about 50 percent more than the original hard-top LaFerrari. In Italy, the car will be sold at about 1.85 million euros including taxes. Requests for the vehicle were triple the planned production run, Galliera said.
While Aperta customers can choose between a soft top or hard one made of carbon fiber, not all are so lucky. Florida-based collector Preston Henn, 85, sued Ferrari in August claiming the company refused to sell him one, even after he sent the company a $1 million deposit, Southern district of Florida court documents show. Henn, who owns several Ferraris including a 275 GTB/C Speciale, was seeking damages of more than $75,000, claiming that not being able to buy the car would hurt his reputation. The suit was dismissed this week.
Aperta deliveries are set to start in the next quarter. The company also announced it’s producing 350 tailor-made supercars to celebrate its 70th anniversary, in a variety of finishes meant to evoke the manufacturer’s iconic past. Even those carsare already sold-out before being produced.
Special editions underpin “the cachet of the brand as there always seem to be far more customers for these vehicles than Ferrari is prepared to build vehicles for,” said Ian Fletcher, an analyst with IHS Markit.",0
"There’s an old saying that tells us that pizza is like sex; when it’s good, it’s great and when it’s bad, it’s still pretty darn good. As with most good things in our life, former President Obama decided to tamper with one of those. Thankfully it’s the pizza this time (though I wouldn’t put the other past him). As sacred as you’d think everyone’s favorite binge food would be, in a sweeping federal register that topped 81,640 pages in lengththere’s a portion about franchise restaurants that might just put your neighborhood pizza joint in a real pinch.
Former President Obama set out so many regulations during his presidency, he apparently holds the record for the greatest number of pages of regulations added to the federal register in both a single day and a single year. And while he’s (thankfully) no longer president, some of his insane regulations will take effect next month if President Trump doesn’t step in.
Thanks to the good old Affordable Care Act rearing it’s ugly head again, any franchise restaurant that has more than 20 locations will be required to provide calorie counts for every item on the menu AND every possible variant of that item. This isn’t such a huge issue for your basic entree and side restaurants where the dishes are all straight forward, but with places like pizza restaurants, or your local Starbucks, the number of ways you can customize your order is almost limitless.
According to the National Review’s Kevin Williamson, Dominos executive Tim McIntyre said “We did the math. With gluten-free crusts to thick to hand-tossed to pan pizza, multiple sizes, cheeses, toppings . . . there are about 34 million possible combinations. That is difficult to put on a menu.”
Not that anybody is ever going to use it. The great majority of Domino’s orders are placed over the Internet and almost all the rest are placed by phone. The number of people who walk into a Domino’s outlet, look at a menu, and order a pizza is relatively small, representing only a few percentage points of Domino’s customers. Other pizza chains see roughly the same thing. So the signs are going to be largely useless, but they’re also kind of expensive, “Useless + Expensive” being the classic federal regulatory equation.
McIntyre estimates a price between $3,500 and $5,000 per location. That isn’t very much to a big corporation like Domino’s, but the Domino’s corporation doesn’t operate all those Domino’s shops: Those are franchises, run by independent owner-operators. The profit margins are low, and five grand is a lot to put on a business that might only be throwing off $40,000 or $50,000 in profit a year. Or less: Franchise chains are pretty tight-lipped about what their stores actually earn, but if we assume a 5 percent profit margin, typical of such restaurants, and an average sales volume of about $730,000, as reported in 2013 by the Motley Fool, then that’s only $36,500 per store, meaning that a $3,500–$5,000 sign could easily eat up a tenth of a year’s profit.
If you want to think of it this way, that’s over a month’s pure profit eaten up in a way that is probably not even helpful to 95% of customers. One can understand the importance of requiring allergen information, but at the point that you’re ordering pizza, who has counting calories at the top of their list? There have actually been studies done that assessed the change in ordering habits of McDonald users before and after the calorie count was put on their menu. Turns out, on average, people’s orders were about 50 calories more when they were made aware of the exact amount that they would be consuming. So in reality, as with much of his legislation, it looks like this Obama policy might turn out to be as big of a failure as his tenure in office.Personally, I prefer to order my indulgence with a little plausible deniability added in, but it looks like I won’t even have that anymore.",1
"It seems like more and more Obama scandals get uncovered with each passing day. Today is of course no different. A recent Center for Immigration Studies report said that up to 200,000 deportation cases were “administratively closed” during Obama’s presidency.
When the cases were administratively closed, the illegal immigrants were essentially free to roam, sometimes indefinitely, with little to no follow-up. These cases and about 600,000 known others are still technically awaiting trial.
Immigration judge Andrew Arthur, who authored the report said of the huge figure:
“My back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest at least 100,000 more are possible, for 200,000 on top of the 600,000 we currently have.”
President Trump has taken action to end administratively closing cases, and has moved to reschedule cases that were previously closed. As Arthur said:
“The good news is that the Trump administration has reversed the practice of administrative closure of cases that are not a priority, and has effectively eliminated prioritization as well, returning ‘prosecutorial discretion’ to its proper role as a law-enforcement tool to be used on a case-by-case basis, not a blanket abdication of authority.”
Check out a recent speech Arthur gave outlining the huge backlog in American immigration courts- a backlog he claims is fueled by Obama:
Well, can’t say I’m surprised, folks. Can you even imagine if Hillary was elected? We would probably never be hearing about any of this stuff because she’d just be continuing Obama’s sketchy dealings.
The mainstream media isn’t going to advertise this one, that’s for sure, so we’re asking you to SHARE it 10,000 times!",1
"ELDER PATRIOT – Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee is warning of the insolvency of the state’s Obamacare exchange. Mr. Lee’s concern is being confirmed by the state’s auditor.
Mr. Lee and the agency’s board of directors have fallen 300,000 enrollees shy of the target they set to insure solvency. That represents a shortfall of enrollees in excess of 21%. Even more troubling, of those who had previously signed up, only 65% renewed their coverage this year. Given that most people only use their health insurance occasionally, if at all, during most years, this raises serious questions about the satisfaction of the enrollees’ who did use it. With a greater number of people leaving Covered California than enrolling, the exchange has some daunting numbers to overcome.
Well, no duh! Obamacare had been modeled after Medicare, that, itself, was insolvent and facing bankruptcy within a decade or so.
The federal government had directed 1.1 billion to Covered California to get the exchange up and running. That’s $1,100,000,000.00 of your tax dollars for just one state. California state law prohibits the spending of any state funds to keep the exchange operational. Without an infusion of additional federal monies the exchange will have to be abandoned and the free market system will be all that remains for Californians.
Now that the exchange’s coffers are almost empty it should be interesting to see what the Republican’s in the U. S. House of Representatives do about it. Many Republicans ran their last campaign on repealing Obamacare. Once elected, they chose to do nothing instead, infuriating their electoral base.
If things progress to the likely conclusion, Republicans in Congress will likely be asked to ante up to save Covered California. Considering that these “guardians” of our finances are spending over a trillion dollars ($1,000,000,000,000.00) more than the government takes in every year, any bailout of California’s Obamacare exchange will necessarily be in the form of additional borrowing. This will result in more debt for your children and their children to pay for the health insurance of certain Californians. In the minds of liberals and progressives this is more acceptable than individuals going into debt for their own healthcare that had been the prior norm for the uninsured.
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting a different result. This could just as accurately serve as the definition of liberalismwhere doubling down on historically proven failed policies and programs is the norm .",1
"Nate downgraded to tropical depression; numerous flash flood warnings and power outages across Alabama         Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost.

Social media video captured heavy rain and strong winds from Hurricane Nate as it hit Alabama Oct. 7. (Reuters)   Nate continued to rapidly weaken Sunday morning as its center of circulation moved north through Mississippi and Alabama, with heavy rain affecting parts of the Florida Panhandle, much of Alabama, western Georgia, and eastern Kentucky. Numerous flash flood warnings remained in effect across Alabama and the far northwest suburbs of Atlanta Sunday morning. At 11 a.m., the National Hurricane Center said the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, and all coastal warnings had been cancelled. Tropical-storm-force wind gusts were expected to continue over the the Florida Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia through Sunday this afternoon. Water levels remained elevated along portions of the northern Gulf coast, according to the Hurricane Center, but should gradually subside this afternoon. Nate first made landfall as a Cateogry 1 storm at the mouth of the Mississippi River at 8 p.m. Saturday evening with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. Then at 1:30 a.m. Sunday, Nate made a second landfall near Biloxi, Miss. at the same intensity. The storm was the first hurricane since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to come ashore in Mississippi. Earlier, a significant storm surge or rise in ocean waters above normally dry land had affected the area from the Mississippi-Alabama border to the Okaloosa/Walton County line in Florida. The storm surge resulted in a new record water level in Pascagoula, along the Mississippi coast near the Alabama border.   One of the highest surge values from #Nate was Pascagoula NOAA Lab, MS which set a new record water level. #mswx pic.twitter.com/e4MuwlB6Ko    At one point, more than 100,000 residents in Mississippi and Alabama had lost electricity, according to the Associated Press. Tens of thousands of power outages were still being reported Sunday morning across Alabama and Mississippi, with the worst of the remaining rain and wind passing near Birmingham, Ala., Sunday morning into the afternoon. There were numerous reports of trees down across Alabama and at 8 a.m., Alabama Power reported 71,000 outages across the state, with many in the Mobile and Birmingham areas. A jacknifed tractor trailer had closed a portion of a major highway in Birmingham.   UPDATE: @bham_fire tell me I-459 SB at Liberty Parkway likely to be shutdown for 1-2 hours. @abc3340 @spann pic.twitter.com/SaoRn8p643    A swath of heavy rain is expected to be the main impact going forward as the remnants of Nate stream northward and interact with a cold front. A widespread two to six inches of rain is forecast through Sunday and Sunday night, with higher amounts likely in spots. All of this rain will fall in under 24 hours, so flash flooding is a concern.  See our previous post for additional storm highlights from before, during, and after landfall overnight and yesterday.  This system will be fast moving, which will limit the rain accumulation potential. That said, the D. C. area should still receive some much needed rain, even as the center of circulation will likely past west of the area late Sunday night or early Monday morning. Scattered showers are likely across the D.C. area Sunday into Sunday night, with heavier rain likely early Monday morning through around midday. Most of the model forecasts keep total rainfall below about an inch for the D.C. region, with heavier amounts of 2-3″ staying well west over the mountains. As for severe thunderstorm potential, the track of the storm carries the strongest energy to our west. In addition, abundant clouds and periods of showery rain will tend to reduce the instability and wind shear (increase in wind speed with altitude) necessary for widespread severe storms. There is an outside chance, say 10-20%, that enough spin energy associated with the remnant circulation will consolidate and intensify into a rotating thunderstorm. Such a storm may or may not produce a tornado.",0
"In its second recall in one day, Toyota announced Tuesday that it plans to recall just over 7,300 2010 Camrys for a brake defect. The problem, if not fixed, could result in leaking brake fluid, and make it more difficult for a driver to stop the car.
Earlier Tuesday, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda announced the company had recalled 437,000 Prius and Lexus vehicles, the latest in a series of recalls that affect nine million cars worldwide.
The issue with the Camrys, according to documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is a power steering hose that is too long and can rub up against a tube for the left rear brake. That could cause the brake tube to wear through, leading to a leak of brake fluid.
In the documents, Toyota says the problem was discovered during an inspection and it hasn't seen evidence of this happening on the road. The automaker says that Camry owners will get recall notices in mid-March and that all fixes should be done by the end of March.
Also today, NHTSA said it is reviewing a number of complaints about the steering on 2009-2010 Toyota Corollas. In a statement, the government said this is standard procedure with complaints and that as of yet, no official investigation has been opened.
At the same time, NHTSA has received a number of complaints about possible steering problems with 2009 and 2010 Corollas. ""We are reviewing steering complaints with the Corolla,"" said NHTSA in a statement, ""to determine if a safety defect investigation is warranted, as is standard procedure with all complaints.""
The first recall announced Tuesday related to a software problem that controls the antilock braking system includes the 2010 model Prius and Lexus HS250h in North America.
Toyota spokesperson Ririko Takeuchi told ABC News 155,000 vehicles will be recalled in North America including 139,000 3rd generation Prius and 16,000 Lexus models.
""Let me assure everyone,"" Toyoda said from the company's global headquarters, ""that we will re-double our commitment to quality as a lifeline of our company with myself taking the lead.""
In Japan, four hybrid models will be recalled – the 2010 Prius, the Prius Plug-in Hybrid, the Sai model sold in Japan and the Lexus HS250h. The latter three models were introduced in the country last year.
Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) will notify hybrid owners of the recall in Japan beginning today. Corrective programming to fix the ABS software program is expected to start Feb. 10 in Japan. The fix process is estimated to take about 40 minutes per vehicle. Details to notify owners in the US were not yet available.
Toyota Executive Vice President Shinichi Sasaki presented a detailed technical explanation of the brake problem during the press conference that lasted about two hours.
The executives advised customers with cars not already fixed to brake firmly as they said the problems have been from customers braking too softly.
""If you are riding on a vehicle before the counter measure,"" Toyoda said as translated, ""and experience this release feeling, in that case, please apply further force on the brakes and it's safe.""
TMC has repeatedly denied withholding information from the public about the global recalls. When asked by ABC News when, specifically, Toyoda first heard of the Prius problem he said as translated, ""I cannot recall the exact month and day when we were notified first. I constantly receive all sorts of information. The department of quality control closely reviews each aspect to guarantee the quality. If you ask when, the answer is this year.""
Toyoda, who plans to visit the US to address Toyota employees about the situation, said he has not yet fixed his own Prius.
When asked by ABC News if any Toyota officials would be held responsible for the global recall Toyoda said, ""In regards to responsibility, Toyota's responsibility is that we have to truly cooperate together to regain the trust of our customers.""
""I don't personally believe Toyota is failure proof,"" Toyoda said as translated, "" But when we receive inquires or reports from customers we make sure that all of those things are corrected and modified, (we) implement improvement so that we can provide better products for our customers.

"A US diplomat visiting Hungary has criticized its PM’s policies towards Russia and stated that he believes Budapest should back the EU in its policy of imposing sanctions on Russia.
On Friday, US Chargé d’Affaires André Goodfriend made the condemnations of Hungarian of Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s policies, particularly in regards to Hungary’s decision to grant Russia a contract to expand the Paks nuclear plant and over its support for the South Stream gas pipeline.
Meanwhile the US denied entry to six Hungarian public officials on Monday in the light of corruption allegations. According to Goodfried, their being banned was related to actions specific to each individual, however, rather than Hungarian politics on the whole.
Goodfried criticized Hungary for how it was veering away from the rule of law which was consolidated after its switch to democracy in 1989 and how it was not a good time to be debating the protection and autonomy of Hungarians in Ukraine.
Orban has been calling for the autonomy of some 200,000 Hungarians who currently reside within Ukrainian borders.
“Particularly with calls for autonomy among Hungarian ethnic nationals in Ukraine… this is not the time to have that discussion,” Goodfriend said.
Hungary should “stand firm with the EU, with EU sanctions” he added and should “understand the sensitivities on the ethnic nationalism question”.
The country has been critical of EU sanctions on Russia. Goodfriend stated that it was not the time for Hungary to “break with its EU partners to criticize so publicly the approach that the partners have taken”.
Hungary, however, is very much dependent on Russian gas supplies and says that the South Stream pipeline would actively aid its energy security.
Earlier in August Orban condemned the EU sanctions against Russia likening them to “shooting oneself in the foot.”
Russia is Hungary’s largest trade partner outside of the EU, with exports worth $3.4 billion in 2013.",1

"EVERY 25 minutes an American baby is born addicted to opioids. The scale of both use and abuse of the drugs in the United States is hard to overstate: in 2015, the most recent year for which figures are available, an estimated 38% of adults took prescription opioids. Of those, one in eight (11.5m people in total) misused their prescription. Around 1m Americans overdosed last year, and 64,000 of them died.
The scourge of opioid abuse gained political salience last year, as voters in parts of the country with high levels of drug overdoses swung strongly towards Donald Trump. The president has taken few steps to combat the opioid crisis since taking office, but on October 26th he is expected to direct his secretary of health and human services to declare a public-health emergency. His national drug commission is due to publish a report on November 1st recommending a mix of rehabilitation, awareness-building and policing as the best response the epidemic.
Politically, it stands to reason that Mr Trump would show interest in the opioid crisis, given that press reports paint the typical abuser as an archetypal older, rural Trump voter, perhaps with a prescription to treat back pain. Yet the government runs the risk of fighting the last war in its effort to quell the epidemic, because the causes and victims of drug overdoses in America are changing fast.
The number of deaths from prescription opioids has continued to rise, from around 11,000 in 2013 to 15,000 a year now (see chart, below). But the rate of growth has slowed, and many forecasters predict it may be nearing its peak. By contrast, the toll from fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times stronger than heroin, is soaring. After claiming just 3,000 lives in 2013, it killed 22,000 people in America last year, more than either heroin or prescription opioids. Deaths from heroin have become far more frequent as well: after being roughly a quarter as common as fatal prescription overdoses in the mid-2000s, they overtook deaths from prescription opioids in 2015.
This change in the leading causes of opioid-related deaths has been accompanied by a shift in the profile of the average victim. The highest rates of prescription-opioid abuse can be found among middle-aged rural whites, including women. By contrast, both fentanyl and heroin users tend to be much younger, more likely to live in cities, somewhat more racially diverse and overwhelmingly male (see heat map above). Reaching people at high risk of exposure to these more potent opioids cannot be done by offering services to former Rust Belt factory workers or Appalachian coal miners, but will require a different approach.
Similarly, most media attention has focused on substance abuse in states Mr Trump won, such as West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. But blue states like Maryland, Delaware and Massachusetts also figure among the current top ten for deaths from drug overdoses (see interactive chart below). That means Mr Trump will need to extend the government’s efforts far beyond his electoral base if he hopes to address the opioid epidemic.",0
"The Rhino XT is already a fantasy. It’s a heavily-modifed Jeep Wrangler built by California’s US Specialty Vehicles that’s inspired by an old Hummer concept that never got made.
It looks so much like a movie prop that it’s become one. It joined the vehicular cast of “The Fate of the Furious” after it was spotted by the production team at a car show. The film’s director, F. Gary Gray, liked it so much that he ordered one for himself. Expect it to make an encore performance in “Furious 9.”
But while the Rhino XT does have a supercharged strapped onto its stock V6, it’s not very fast. The three hundred or so horsepower it puts out is just a little more than the stock Wrangler provides. But now there’s a Rhino XT that’s truly hellacious.

"Had hurricanes Harvey and Irma not hit, September would likely have produced a jobs gain of around 190,000, experts said Friday after a dismal employment report that saw figures dip into negative territory for the first time in seven years.
The 33,000 jobs lost in September — in contrast to a gain of 90,000 expected by economists — are the direct result of Hurricane Harvey sweeping through the heart of Texas’s Gulf Coast oil industry and flooding Houston, and Hurricane Irma barreling north through Florida on a hard-to-predict course that prompted large-scale evacuations.
The Department of Labor says more than 11 million workers live in the affected areas, representing nearly 8 percent of the country’s jobs. Restaurants, which had been adding an average of 24,000 jobs per month, lost 105,000 in September.
“We knew that the hurricanes were going to affect nonfarm payrolls to a certain extent,” said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America. “We’ll expect to see a bump back for the next couple of months,” he predicted, a function of people going back to work in affected areas, an expected increase in demand in some fields like construction and later revisions by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of its data.
Related: Hurricanes Harvey and Irma Wiped Out 33,000 Jobs Last Month
This month’s revision of July and August employment numbers trimmed the total number of jobs gained by 38,000 over the two months, with an upward revision in August unable to cancel out a larger downward revision for July.
Even a surprisingly high wage growth figure could have been affected by the storms, labor market experts said.
“To see average hourly earnings up 2.9 percent certainly is welcome news indeed,” said Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com’s senior economic analyst, but he added that the storms might be responsible for distorting the data.
“We want to be cautious to make sure this is sustained,” he said, given the high number of low-wage restaurant jobs that were shed last month. “That could've had the temporary impact of skewing pay higher because lower-paid jobs weren’t present.”
Other figures in the monthly report paint a more consistently positive picture. Economists say some of the disconnect stems from the fact that the Department of Labor’s monthly snapshot on jobs is gathered from two different surveys, with different methodologies and timelines for collecting data.
Sectors including health care and transportation actually saw job gains for the month. The overall unemployment rate fell from 4.4 percent to 4.2 percent, the labor force participation rate ticked up from 62.9 percent to 63.1 percent, and the employment-population ratio hit a post-recession high of 60.4 percent.
“It looks like something about the tighter labor market is finally luring them back in,” said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. “Whether it is the high chance of finding something, or the wages … it's hard to know from these data alone.”
“I’m on Main Street and I see the work that our clients are doing — they’re all still hiring,” said Tom Gimbel, founder and CEO of the staffing and recruiting firm LaSalle Network. “My open job orders with clients is up in October and was up in September.""
LinkedIn chief economist Guy Berger suggested that the improvements in labor force participation could be coming at the expense of more rapidly accelerating wages. “We’re discovering there still is this pool of people willing to work and keeping wage pressure down,” he said. “Job growth is moderate, but it’s fast enough the soak up the shadow supply of workers,” he said, although he added it might be another year or more before this impact trickles down to workers’ paychecks.
Data on private payroll job growth from ADP and Moody's Analytics also supplied mixed messages. Although it showed a steep drop from the previous month, the 135,000 jobs added exceeded economists’ expectations.
“This month is difficult to judge because of the area impacted,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and head of the ADP Research Institute. Had Harvey and Irma simply not occurred, she estimated that September would have produced a gain of around 190,000. “The storm impact may have cut 50,000 to 60,000 jobs,” she said.
Taken together, experts say the overall picture is of an economy much the same as it was pre-Harvey and Irma. “I think the report overall just confirms that the underlying trends in the U. S. economy remain intact,” Hamrick said.
“They suggest a lot of the trends we’ve been seeing for some time, which is the labor market recovery continues to broaden more, people are finding an incentive to come back into the labor force,” said Sameer Samana, a global quantitative and technical strategist for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
The increased labor force participation rate in particular, he said, was a particularly good sign. “That’s a huge positive in terms of labor market strength.”",0

But in truth, the money is only part of the prize for a kid like Macie.
""You get really down on yourself, people judge you and you just feel like you can't do anything,"" Macie said. ""And all of a sudden you have this random stranger who believes in you and knows that you're not who your parents are, and you do have a chance.""
Karl knows what it means for a parent to be absent. He shot an intruder who turned out to be a police officer, and served 17 years, unable to support his own two daughters.
""It's nice to be able to give back or correct wrongs,"" he said. ""Maybe it's all just part of the healing process.""
Karl says the money he sends to kids like Cy helps ease the anger of all those wasted years.

"Protected status no longer justified for Central Americans and Haitians in U. S., State Dept. says            Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.    You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.
The State Department said on Nov. 3 that Central American and Haitian immigrants no longer needed protected status. Here is what you need to know about TPS. (Melissa Macaya,Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)     More than 300,000 Central Americans and Haitians living in the United States under a form of temporary permission no longer need to be shielded from deportation, the State Department told Homeland Security officials this week, a few days ahead of a highly anticipated DHS announcement about whether to renew that protection. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sent a letter to acting DHS secretary Elaine Duke to inform her that conditions in Central America and Haiti that had been used to justify the protection no longer necessitate a reprieve for the migrants, some of whom have been allowed to live and work in the United States for 20 years under a program known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Tillerson’s assessment, required by law, has not been made public, but its recommendations were confirmed by several administration officials familiar with its contents. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. DHS has until Monday to announce its plans for roughly 57,000 Hondurans and 2,500 Nicaraguans whose TPS protections will expire in early January. Although most arrived here illegally, they were exempted from deportation after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America in 1998. Their TPS protections have been renewed routinely since then, in some cases following additional natural disasters and resulting insecurity. Congress established TPS in 1990 to protect foreign nationals from being returned to their countries amid instability and precarious conditions caused by natural disasters or armed conflict.   Trump administration officials have repeatedly noted that the program was meant to be temporary — not a way for people to become long-term residents of the United States. Officials said that long-ago disasters should not be used to extend provisional immigration status when the initial justification for it no longer exists. Tillerson’s assessment is consistent with broader administration efforts to reduce immigration to the United States and comply with legal restrictions that it maintains have been loosely enforced in the past. “It is fair to say that this administration is interpreting the law, exactly as it is, which the previous one did not,” an administration official said.  The official acknowledged that the countries in question continue to suffer from problems of poverty, corruption and violence that, in many cases, have spurred illegal migration. But, the official said, those conditions should be addressed in other ways. “The solution is going to require working with Congress and these countries,” the official said. “We are equally committed to finding that. There is no lack of empathy here.” But “with this particular law,” the official said, “it is very clear to this administration what needs to be done.” Administration officials have also said that the return of tens of thousands of migrants could benefit the Central American nations and Haiti, because their citizens will return with job skills, democratic values and personal savings acquired from living long term in the United States. Many of the immigrants have homes, businesses and U. S.-born children, but if the protections expire, they could be subject to arrest and deportation. “We understand this is a very difficult decision,” the administration official said. DHS officials declined to say Friday what the agency planned to do, or when an announcement would be made. “The acting secretary has made no decision on TPS,” said Tyler Houlton, a spokesman for the agency.  Tillerson’s letter does not amount to a recommendation. But DHS is required to seek the agency’s input, and officials said the State Department’s position carries significant weight.   The largest group of TPS recipients — about 200,000 — are from El Salvador, and DHS has until early January to announce its plans for them. At least 30,000 of them live in the Washington area, according to immigrant advocacy groups. When the Obama administration last extended TPS for the Salvadorans, in July 2016, it said that they were eligible because conditions justifying it continued to be met. “There continues to be a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living conditions in El Salvador resulting from a series of earthquakes in 2001,” Homeland Security officials said at the time, “and El Salvador remains unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return of its nationals.”  DHS must also decide what to do with about 50,000 Haitian TPS recipients by Thanksgiving Day. The Haitians, who are concentrated in South Florida, received TPS after a 2010 earthquake that killed 200,000.  Advocates say removing TPS would be a cruel blow to long-standing, law-abiding immigrants, forcing them to decide between remaining in the country illegally or leaving their homes and families. According to a recent study by the left-leaning Center for American Progress, TPS recipients have nearly 275,000 U.S.-born children. If recipients lose their protections but defy orders to leave, it would not be difficult for immigration enforcement agents to find them. The provisional nature of their status requires them to maintain current records with DHS; the agency has their addresses, phone numbers and other personal information. “Terminating TPS at this time would be inhumane and untenable,” a group of Catholic charity leaders wrote to Duke in a recent letter, arguing that it would “needlessly add large numbers of Hondurans and Salvadorans to the undocumented population in the U.S., lead to family separation, and unnecessarily cause the Department of Homeland Security to expend resources on individuals who are already registered with our government and whose safe return is forestalled by dire humanitarian circumstances.” If DHS ends the TPS protections, it is expected to grant recipients a grace period of at least six months or more to give them time to prepare for departure.  In May, then-DHS Secretary John F. Kelly extended TPS for Haitians for six months, far less than the 18-month waivers granted by the Obama administration. Kelly, in a statement at the time, called the six-month window a “limited” extension whose purpose was to “allow Haitian TPS recipients living in the United States time to attain travel documents and make other necessary arrangements for their ultimate departure from the United States.” Haiti is the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country and remains in the grips of a cholera epidemic triggered by U.N. troops who were sent after the earthquake.  Advocates of reduced immigration say the Haiti decision will be a key test of the administration’s willingness to follow through on its by-the-books rhetoric.  Immigration experts believe many of the Haitians could attempt to seek refuge in Canada, particularly French-speaking Quebec, to avoid arrest and deportation.",0
"Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda, in his second press conference since Friday, announced the company recalled an additional 437,000 vehicles worldwide.
The recall related to a software problem that controls the antilock braking system includes the 2010 model Prius and Lexus HS250h in North America.
Toyota spokesperson Ririko Takeuchi told ABC News 155,000 vehicles will be recalled in North America including 139,000 3rd generation Prius and 16,000 Lexus models.
""Let me assure everyone,"" Toyoda said from the company's global headquarters, ""that we will re-double our commitment to quality as a lifeline of our company with myself taking the lead.""
In Japan, four hybrid models will be recalled – the 2010 Prius, the Prius Plug-in Hybrid, the Sai model sold in Japan and the Lexus HS250h. The latter three models were introduced in the country last year.
Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) will notify hybrid owners of the recall in Japan beginning today. Corrective programming to fix the ABS software program is expected to start Feb 10 in Japan. The fix process is estimated to take about 40 minutes per vehicle.
Details to notify owners in the US were not yet available.
Toyota Executive Vice President Shinichi Sasaki presented a detailed technical explanation of the brake problem during the press conference that lasted about two hours.
The executives advised customers with cars not already fixed to brake firmly as they said the problems have been from customers braking too softly.
""If you are riding on a vehicle before the counter measure,"" Toyoda said as translated, ""and experience this release feeling, in that case, please apply further force on the brakes and it's safe.""
TMC has repeatedly denied withholding information from the public about the global recalls.
When asked by ABC News when, specifically, Toyoda first heard of the Prius problem he said as translated, ""I cannot recall the exact month and day when we were notified first. I constantly receive all sorts of information. The department of quality control closely reviews each aspect to guarantee the quality. If you ask when, the answer is this year.""

"Stuart Wilson says people thought he was crazy when he gambled $39,000—his life savings—on a 4.6-acre field in Wales. Having heard a farmer's story about moles digging up bits of pottery on the land, the amateur archaeologist tells the Guardian he had a hunch that something important lay beneath, and when the parcel went on the market in 2004, he bought it.
Now, it looks like his bet is paying off: He believes his land is sitting atop the lost city of Trellech—Wales' largest city in the 13th century, reports the BBC—and the Guardian reports his theory is starting to gain traction.
Wilson, a former toll collector who got his undergrad degree in archaeology, estimates the project has cost more than $200,000, funded in part through donations (you can be an archaeologist for a day for $61).
With help from some 1,000 volunteers, Wilson says he has so far discovered eight buildings, and he intends to spend 2017 working on the remains of what he believes is a manor house surrounded by a moat.
In 2006, he told Archaeology.org that excavating the field ""will probably take about 50 years, so basically the rest of my life."" As for the history of the site, it was founded by the de Clare family in the 1200s as a hub that produced iron weapons and armor, and its population exploded.
Per Wilson, in just 25 years it grew to 10,000 people—a quarter of London's size, though Wilson points out it took London 250 years to amass its 40,000 people.
The BBC reports the de Clares' settlement is thought to have been destroyed in 1296. (Read about the seven biggest archaeology finds of 2016.)

The wealthiest Americans pay the largest proportion of taxes. Consequently, any tax cut, unless very carefully tailored, will benefit them. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)    “This is striking: 50% of households that claim State & Local Tax deduction make under $100K — & now @SpeakerRyan wants to throw it away.”
— House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in a tweet, Oct. 12, 2017 With House passage of a budget blueprint on Oct. 26 that could open the door to $1.5 trillion in deficit-financed tax cuts over 10 years, congressional Republicans presumably will soon unveil details of how they plan to reshape the tax code. One item high on the list: repealing the deduction for state and local taxes, known in the tax trade as the SALT deduction. We’ve written a primer on this deduction, exploring the dubious claim about whether red low-tax states are subsidizing blue high-tax states. This tweet by Pelosi has been sitting in our inbox for a while, after a reader expressed concern about it. Pelosi, at a news conference before the House vote, asserted the pending tax bill was “an assault on the middle class, an assault on state and local tax deductions. And I bring this up because it affects everyone.” She ticked off the average deduction for some individual states, such as: “If you live in Virginia, same thing, a million and a half people are affected. … If you live in Virginia, the average deduction is over $11,000.”   Every taxpayer has a choice of taking either a standard deduction or to itemize deductions, which in addition to state and local (and property) taxes can include mortgage interest payments, charitable contributions and medical expenses above a certain threshold. For most people, especially those who do not own their homes, the standard deduction is larger than itemized deductions — and the Trump administration proposes to boost the standard deduction (but eliminate personal and dependent exemptions). Currently, about 30 percent of tax filers opt for the itemized deduction — and virtually all of them take the SALT deduction, according to the Tax Policy Center. Pelosi frames the SALT deduction as a middle-class tax break. But it’s really wealthier Americans who benefit. With itemized deductions, the value of the deduction increases as you move into a higher tax bracket. So $1,000 in deductions would be worth almost $400 to someone in the highest tax bracket but only $250 for a taxpayer in the 25 percent tax bracket. In justifying her figure that 50 percent of American who claimed the SALT deduction make less than $100,000, her staff pointed to a table in a report produced by the Government Finance Officers Association arguing for keeping the deduction intact. The table, which is based on 2015 Statistics of Income (SOI) data from the IRS, is reproduced below. You can see that 53 percent of the people claiming the deduction make less than $100,000. [Mea culpa, we misread read the chart. The correct figure is 54 percent.]  But that’s not the whole story. Look at the last column, which shows the percentage of the deduction received by various income levels. Taxpayers making less than $100,000 may comprise 53 percent of the tax filers, but they get less than 25 percent of the deductions. Tax filers making more than $100,000 get more than 75 percent. As we have explained before (see the video above), most taxes are paid by the wealthiest Americans, so it follows that most of the benefits of tax deductions would also flow to wealthy Americans. There is another table in the report that demonstrates this. This shows how huge the average SALT deduction is for people making more than $500,000 — and how much their taxes would increase if the deduction were repealed.   This brings us to Pelosi’s statement about the average deduction in various states. We highlighted her comment about Virginia — an average of above $11,000. The problem with an average is that it gets inflated by the big numbers for a few people. We’d rather use a median, though it’s difficult to calculate precisely and we could not find an expert who had done so. However, the Tax Policy Center does produce a state-by-state breakdown of income ranges. When you calculate the average deduction for taxpayers with adjusted gross income (AGI) below $100,000 — who were highlighted in Pelosi’s tweet — that’s an average tax deduction of about $5,000. That’s much less than the average she touted at her news conference. Indeed, the administration argues that many people in the lower tax brackets will abandon itemizing tax deductions because the increased standard deduction will make up for it. Meanwhile, the average tax deduction forVirginians with an AGI above $100,000 is nearly $18,000. This chart by the Committee for a Responsible Budget, drawn from 2013 Congressional Budget Office data, demonstrates how the benefitsof the SALT deduction are tilted toward the wealthy. The top 20 percent is roughly tax filers making above $100,000, though it varies according to household size.  “There are millions and millions of hard-working households across America that are at risk of losing a deduction that is a really big deal in terms of their family budget,” said Henry Connelly, a Pelosi spokesman. “Eliminating the state and local tax deduction has very serious consequences that create very serious pain in the lives of millions of American families. Dismissing the consequences that will be felt by the majority of families who have come to rely on this tax deduction does a disservice to the debate.”  This is a good example of how tax data can be manipulated. Pelosi is usually eager to point out that wealthy Americans will mostly benefit from broad-based tax cuts. In this case, wealthier Americans would mainly feel the effects of a broad-based elimination of a tax break. But in this case, Pelosi chooses to ignore the distributional tables and instead focus on the absolute number of people affected, even if the impact is mostly felt by the rich.

"After 22 years in a condo near the beach in Shirley, N. Y., Dan and Donna Cresci longed for a home in a walkable community. They considered Port Jefferson, Bellport, Patchogue and East Hampton, but finally settled on Sayville, a congenial 5.4-square-mile hamlet with about 16,853 residents, on the South Shore of Long Island, midway between Manhattan and Montauk.
“There were lots we liked about all those places,” said Mr. Cresci, an aerospace engineer. “But Sayville seemed to have it all.”
So last fall, after he dropped by an open house on his way home from work, they bought a rebuilt 1911 house on a quarter-acre lot there, with three bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms and a heated sun porch, for $640,000.
“We are now living in a Norman Rockwell neighborhood,” Mr. Cresci said. The couple, both 53, and their twin 19-year-old daughters (a son, 20, is at college) ride bikes and walk to the grocery store, restaurants, the hardware store and the local Loughlin Vineyard. Last summer, they attended concerts at the Common Ground at Rotary Park, a community park, and walked to the Sayville ferry for the 20- to 25-minute ride across the Great South Bay to Fire Island. They checked out Corvettes and souped-up Mustangs at a car show on Montauk Highway, which is called Main Street in Sayville. And when Mr. Cresci goes on his biannual business trips, he walks to the local Long Island Rail Road station and takes the train to John F. Kennedy International Airport.
Part of the Suffolk County town of Islip, Sayville provides a pedestrian-friendly downtown for Oakdale to the west and Bayport to the east. The adjoining hamlet of West Sayville, which is part of Sayville’s school district, offers a Suffolk County-owned golf course and the Long Island Maritime Museum, where visitors can learn about the area’s fishing and clamming history.
An eclectic mix of accessories and clothing boutiques, home-goods shops like Sayville General Store and some 23 restaurants can be found in the hamlet, along with a four-screen movie theater. “Sayville has such a charm about it, and there is a pride among the residents,” said Angie M. Carpenter, the Islip town supervisor.
“They hold many country-like festivals” — like the Sayville Apple Festival, on Oct. 21, at the Islip Grange — “throughout the year,” she said. “There is a real sense of community.”
“The Porch Is Open” reads a sign on the wraparound front porch of the 100-year-old house that Cathy Cohen, 75, has lived in for 48 years. “Neighbors party on it all the time,” Ms. Cohen said. “Even when I’m not home.”
During Ms. Cohen’s 65-year tenure in Sayville, the hamlet has grown and “changed tremendously,” she said. The dairy farm she used to walk to is long gone, and once-vacant lots are now filled with “huge tracts of housing.” Yet the affability remains in what she said is still “a quaint village.”
There are “an amazing amount of people who never left,” Ms. Cohen said. “They grew up, their kids grew up, and generations down, they are still here. It is a great place for raising a family.”
Victorians abound. South of Montauk Highway, the main east-west thoroughfare, grandes dames are set back on deep lots along broad, shady avenues stretching south to the bay.
“A sprinkling of homes have docks,” said Andrea Casey, a salesperson with Century 21 Bay’s Edge Realty. While most of the coastline is reserved for commercial and public use, houses along Sunset Drive and West Lane back up to canals.
At the tip of Foster Avenue, Sayville Marina Park’s three tennis courts, sandy beach and boat docks dominate the waterfront. Nearby, manicured gardens and a gazebo at Land’s End Caterers provide a picturesque bay-front setting for weddings, said Manon Compitello, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who lives in Sayville.
Ferries to Cherry Grove, Fire Island Pines, Sailors Haven and the Sunken Forest board at the Sayville Ferry Service docks along River Road.
North of Montauk Highway, there are newer two-story houses built on three-quarter-acre lots on cul-de-sacs. Capes and ranches occupy smaller lots. Condos, co-ops, age-restricted rental apartments and an assisted-living facility line Lakeland Avenue, the thoroughfare stretching north to Sunrise Highway’s big box shopping areas.
“We get a lot of first-time home buyers who want to be in Sayville,” said Leesa Byrnes, broker-owner of Leesa Byrnes Realty. A three-bedroom, two-bath ranch in good shape on a quarter-acre lot, she said, will run between $375,000 and $400,000. Homes that need work range from the low- to mid-$300,000s, while trade-up homes with four bedrooms and two and a half baths on half-acre lots will cost about $650,000.
On Oct. 11, there were 39 houses and nine condominiums on the market. The priciest, at $1,199,000, was a restored five-bedroom 1890 Victorian with an in-ground pool on a half-acre. The least expensive, at $245,000, was a two-bedroom, one-level condo at the age-restricted Sunrise Village, a gated community built in 1987.
Good schools are a draw, Ms. Compitello said, and because Sayville is not incorporated, “you get all the benefits of a town without a village tax.”
But “one of our biggest struggles is our lack of inventory” coupled with “lots of buyers,” she added, noting that homes are selling faster and at higher prices than a year ago. The average sales price in 2017, through Oct. 11, was $453,736, a 5.8 percent increase over the average price of the same period the previous year, $428,691.
Locals buzz about plans for the former Island Hills Golf Club, at the hamlet’s northern edge. Developers Gregg and Mitchell D. Rechler, who bought the property last year, have been meeting with community groups, hoping to change the single-family zoning to build Greybarn, a multifamily rental community with 1,378 apartments “geared to keep millennials and downsizers close to home,” Gregg Rechler said.
Clustered in three- and four-story buildings, with rooflines and eaves resembling large Hamptons-style summer houses, the property is being designed to “benefit the people who already live in the community, as well as the residents who live in Greybarn,” Mr. Rechler said. A 22-acre “perimeter park around the property that equates to a two-mile walking and bike trail will have various pocket parks as it goes along,” he continued, including a playground, an exercise park and a dog park. Plans also call for a community farm, a pond, multiple swimming pools and a large clubhouse with a fitness center and screening rooms.
A shuttle will take residents from Greybarn to stores and restaurants downtown.
There are 2,948 students in the well-regarded Sayville public schools, which draw from Sayville and West Sayville.
Students in kindergarten through grade five attend Cherry Avenue Elementary School, Lincoln Avenue Elementary School or Sunrise Drive Elementary School. Grades six to eight are served by Sayville Middle School. Students move up to Sayville High School for grades nine to 12.
The latest available mean SAT scores were 533 in reading, 564 in math and 521 in writing, compared to New York State scores of 489, 501 and 477.
Some Sayville properties are zoned for the Connetquot Central School District.
Commuters to Manhattan, 56 miles west, can catch a train at the Sayville station on the Montauk branch of the Long Island Rail Road. Rush-hour rides to Penn Station take from an hour and 16 minutes to an hour and 40 minutes. Most trips to Manhattan require changing trains in Jamaica or Babylon. The monthly fare is $391.
Once the South Side Railroad reached Sayville in 1868, the hamlet became a summer resort. Actors and actresses stayed in hotels and rented houses in the area. From 1909 to 1919, a seasonal trolley — initially horse-drawn, later electric — connected the railroad station with hotels along Candee Avenue, said George J. Munkenbeck, the Islip town historian.",0
"Fukushima will dump 770,000 tons of deadly nuclear waste into the ocean, which experts have warned will cause “apocalyptic” numbers of people to die.
According toTokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) chairman, Takashi Kawamura, the decision has already been made to put the lives of millions of fish, humans and animals at risk by dumping the radioactive material from the Fukushima plant into the Pacific ocean – despite strong opposition from fisherman.
Rt.com reports: “I’m very sorry that Tepco has been prolonging making a decision,” the new chairman of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) Takashi Kawamura told reporters on Thursday, reported Reuters. “We could have decided much earlier, and that is Tepco’s responsibility.”
The plan still requires the approval of the Japanese government before TEPCO can proceed.
Some 770,000 tons (metric) of tritium-containing water is currently stored in 580 tanks at the plant, reported the Japan Times. Toxic water at the plant is currently being treated through a processing system that can remove 62 different types of radioactive material, except tritium.
The local fishermen cooperative has hit out at the plan, saying it had not been discussed with local residents.
“Releasing (tritium) into the sea will create a new wave of unfounded rumors, making our efforts all for naught,” Kanji Tachiya, head of a local fishermen cooperative, told the Japan Times.

"Tesla Motors has today unveiled the highly anticipatedTesla Model 3– and with over 500,000 pre-orders to fill, customers from Australia are askingwhen theirswill arrive.
During a presentation today at the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk was keen for customers to understand when their orders would be coming through and wanted to assure buyers that the company is ramping up production as a matter of priority.
“We were told we’d never get to 20,000 units per year withModel S[after producing 600Roadstersper year], well we’re now at 50,000 units per year of Model S. And with Model X combined it’s at around 100,000 units.
“We’re confident we can go from a production rate of 50,000 units per year with Model S to 500,000 units per year with Model 3,” said Musk.
“By end of the year, getting to that rate appears to be quite lengthy (10,000 units per month), there are manufacturers beyond my control. By the end of next year getting to 10,000 a week looks likely, but it’s hard to predict.”
The production schedule will begin immediately servicing the west coast of North America, followed by the east coast, then Europe and shortly after right-hand drive markets like Australia.
Australian deliveries are expected to start from early 2019, with Musk referring specifically to a tweet from an Australian customer, who asked when he would get his long-awaited Model 3 order.
Australia was one of the first markets in the world able to place a pre-order for the Model 3 and owners paid deposits of $1500 for a product they hadn’t yet seen.

"Confused About What to Eat? You're Not Alone
Confused About What to Eat? You're Not Alone
France’s much-loved croissant au beurre has run up against the forces of global markets.
Finding butter for the breakfast staple has become a challenge across France. Soaring global demand and falling supplies have boosted butter prices, and with French supermarkets unwilling to pay more for the dairy product, producers are taking their wares across the border. That has left the French, the world’s biggest per-capita consumers of butter, short of a key ingredient for their sauces and tarts.
“The issue is purely French and is related to the fact that there’s a price war raging between French retailers,” Thierry Roquefeuil, chairman of the milk-producers’ federation FNPL, said in a phone interview from his farm near Figeac, in Southwestern France. “French retailers refuse to increase prices, even by few cents, even for butter. Dairy producers see that there’s an outside demand at higher prices so they sell abroad, and rightfully so.”
Global butter prices have almost tripled to 7,000 euros ($8,144) a ton from 2,500 euros in 2016, according to Agritel, an Paris-based farming consultancy. In Europe,prices peaked at about 6,500 euros a ton in September, the highest since the European Commission began collecting such data in 2000.
WhileFrance’s Food Retailers’ Federation is underplaying the shortages as a temporary logistical problem linked in part to people hoarding butter, the issue made it last week to the floor of the French parliament. Questioned by lawmakers, Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said he hoped a deal could soon be found between retailers and dairy producers.
“I want to reassure all the consumers that soon butter will find its way back to shop shelves and consumers won’t be deprived of this French commodity that does honor to French tables and is the pride of French dairy production,” Travert said in the National Assembly on Wednesday.
A report released Saturday by the consulting firm Nielsen showed that 30 percent of butter demand in French supermarkets wasn’t met between Oct. 16 and Oct. 22. The proportion was as high as 46 percent in some stores, mostly due to hoarding, it said.
The problem can be traced to the end of milk-production quotas in April 2015 that led to a glut early last year in Europe, and a drastic drop in prices. This prompted production cuts by spring this year.
The reduction coincided with other global milk products exporters curbing their own output: the U. S. stopped selling abroad to address higher domestic demand while New Zealand, the world’s biggest dairy exporter, experienced lower production due to droughts, Pierre Begoc, an Agritel analyst, said in a phone interview.
“The butter shortage in French supermarkets is the direct consequence of the 2016 milk crisis which prompted a 3 percent drop in production,” Xavier Hollandtsni , a Kedge Business School strategy teacher and an expert on agricultural matters, said in a note Thursday.
The butter market also encountered a push from the demand side. Butter and cheese remain the dairy products in highest demand, especially in Asia, according to Agritel’s Begoc.
“Global demand started to pick up, with China starting to buy again after having stopped for a few months to tap into its stocks, leading to a substantial rise in milk and butter prices,” Begoc said.
French retailers have not adapted to the new market reality and have kept a cap on prices, Roquefeuil said. For French dairy companies, it’s easier to export to countries such as Germany, where retailers are willing to pay a higher price, he said.
“There’s an evolution of butter consumption,” he said. “Demand is strong and the industry has to adapt to the new consumption.”
The shortage in France has been compounded by a panicked rush by consumers to stock up in the past few weeks. The food retail group has said any butter shortage will be short-lived.
Industry projections show that after the recent peak, butter prices may head down slightly as milk production is now picking up, Agritel’s Begoc said.
That should come as a relief to French consumers who need butter for not just their tartines and croissants but also for cooking sauces and baking everything from a tarte tatin to an eclair au chocolat.

"A federal investigation into the ""dark underbelly"" of college basketball exposed bribery schemes in which coaches at top programs took cash to steer star athletes to certain managers and helped funnel payoffs to players' families to ensure they signed with particular schools, prosecutors said Tuesday.
Some of the biggest names in college sports — from Adidas to the University of Louisville — were caught up in the probe, which began in 2015 with the help of a fallen financial adviser who agreed to wear a wire for the feds.
Acting U. S. Attorney Joon Kim said the FBI and prosecutors set out to investigate the ""dark underbelly of college basketball"" and found a pay-to-play culture flourishing in some corners of the NCAA.
""The picture of college basketball painted by the charges is not a pretty one — coaches at some of the nation’s top programs taking cash bribes, managers and advisers circling blue-chip prospects like coyotes, and employees of a global sportswear company funneling cash to families of high school recruits,"" he said.
The investigation is ongoing, Kim said. On Tuesday, federal agents executed search warrants at the offices of ASM Sports, which represents 30 current NBA players but which was not charged in the three criminal complaints filed in Manhattan.
Those documents detail a web of corruption in which money allegedly flowed between athletes' families, coaches and others with a financial interest in basketball — with the goal of locking in where young athletes would play, who would represent them and what clothing they would wear.
""If we take care of everybody and everything is done, we control everything,"" Christian Dawkins, a former recruiter for ASM who was reportedly fired for using a player’s credit card, told an undercover agent, according to one complaint.
”You can make millions off one kid.""
Four assistant coaches accused of taking bribes of between $13,000 and $100,000 to convince players to hire Dawkins and other advisers were identified as Chuck Person of Auburn University, Lamont Evans of Oklahoma State University, Emanuel Richardson of the University of Arizona, and Anthony Bland of the University of Southern California.
""When you've coached Kobe Bryant, played with Phil Jackson, it goes a long way,"" Person, who played in the NBA, bragged on one recording quoted in the complaint. He allegedly agreed to push players to buy clothing from a bespoke clothing company owned by former NBA referee Rashan Michel, who was also charged.
Also arrested was James Gatto, director of global sports marketing for Adidas, who was accused of paying the families of high-school standouts to sign with two universities that had sponsorship deals with the apparel giant.
The court documents don't name the colleges, but NCAA powerhouse Louisville confirmed it was part of the investigation and pledged to ""cooperate fully."" The other college was described as a private research university in Florida with 16,000 students and 15 varsity sports, which matches up with the University of Miami, which said it could not comment.
Working with Gatto were Merl Code, an adviser to Adidas, and Jonathan Brad Augustine, who runs an amateur basketball program sponsored by Adidas, prosecutors said. Dawkins and investment adviser Munish Sood helped broker the agreements to pay the families $250,000, court documents say.
The idea, according to investigators, was that the high-schoolers would matriculate at the colleges sponsored by Adidas; sign with Dawkins and Sood, who would see a windfall when the players joined the NBA; and ink a sponsorship deal with Adidas when they went pro.
""You guys are being introduced to ... how stuff happens with kids and getting into particular schools and so this is kind of one of those instances where we needed to step up and help one of our flagship schools...secure a five-star caliber kid,"" Code said to Sood and an undercover agent in one recording.
After the charges were announced, Adidas said it had just learned of Gatto's arrest. ""We’re unaware of any misconduct and will fully cooperate with authorities to understand more,"" the company said in a statement.
Auburn said it had suspended Person, saying in a statement that ""we are saddened, angry and disappointed."" The University of Arizona said it was ""appalled"" and had suspended Richardson. USC said it was ""shocked"" to hear of Bland's arrest and ""does not tolerate misconduct in any way."" Oklahoma State said it was ""surprised"" to hear of Evans' arrest and is ""cooperating fully with officials.""
The NCAA said the charges were ""deeply disturbing.""
""We have no tolerance whatsoever for this alleged behavior. Coaches hold a unique position of trust with student-athletes and their families and these bribery allegations, if true, suggest an extraordinary and despicable breach of that trust,"" NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement.
The investigation was carried out largely with the assistance of a cooperating witness, identified Tuesday as Louis Martin Blazer, a former Pittsburgh financial adviser who found himself in hot water in 2014 for siphoning money from professional athletes whose accounts he managed to finance movie and music ventures.
He ultimately pleaded guilty to identity theft, making false statements and documents, wire fraud and security fraud. Under a cooperation agreement, prosecutors agreed to inform the sentencing judge of Blazer's help in the NCAA case.",0

"Tesla (TSLA)'s Model 3, the electric car maker's most affordable vehicle as it targets the automotive mainstream, is likely to be dependable as well as thrifty, Consumer Reports concludes its annual reliability survey.
The magazine bases its prediction for the Model 2, which started shipping to customers in July despite production snafus, on survey data for the more expensive Tesla Model S. The two vehicles share much of their technology, and the Model S rates above average in the survey of CR subscribers.
The Model 3 is priced at $35,000, compared with $68,000 and up for the Model S.
Another new electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt, should also prove reliable. ""Electric vehicles are inherently less complicated than gasoline or hybrid alternatives,"" said Jake Fisher, CR director of auto testing. ""The Model 3 is the least complicated Tesla yet and should benefit from what Tesla has learned from the Model S.""
While CR's reliability survey, drawn from the repair records for 640,000 vehicles, bodes well for electric car fans, the latest finding also show mounting problems for new vehicles. The issues most often cited by motorists: continuously variable transmissions and infotainment systems. Fisher suggested holding off on buying recently introduced models until manufacturers have worked out the tech bugs.
Toyota topped the list for overall brand reliability, followed by its luxury brand Lexus. Kia, Audi, BMW, Subaru, Infiniti, Buick, Honda and Hyundai rounded out the top 10.
U. S. automakers has a mixed record when it comes to reliability, according to CR.
Chrysler gained 10 positions this year from last to land at No. 17. Jeep, another Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) brand, finished 20th but showed reliability improvement with its Cherokee SUV. Ford (F) also rose in the survey to No. 15. Its F-150 pickup returned to an average reliability rating after being rated below average last year.
General Motors' (GM) brands lost ground this year in the survey. Buick, ranked No. 3 last year in reliability, dropped to eighth. Chevrolet finished at No. 15 while GMC and Cadillac were the bottom two among 27 brands.
European luxury brands continued a relatively strong performance. Audi ranked fourth, BMW fifth and Mercedes-Benz No. 14 on the reliability survey.",0
"The 4 trillion yen ($35 billion) clean-up at Fukushima isn’t going smoothly. The former nuclear power station is quickly turning into a robot graveyard due to recurrent failures with theremote-controlled probes sent inside.
Barely a fifth of the way into their mission, the engineers monitoring the Scorpion’s progress conceded defeat. With a remote-controlled snip of its cable, the latest robot sent into the bowels of one of Fukushima Daiichi’s damaged reactors was cut loose, its progress stalled by lumps of fuel that overheated when the nuclear plant suffered atriple meltdownsix years ago this week.
As the 60cm-long Toshiba robot, equipped with a pair of cameras and sensors to gauge radiation levels was left to its fate last month, the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), attempted to play down the failure of yet another reconnaissance mission to determine the exact location and condition of the melted fuel.
Even though its mission had been aborted, the utility said, “valuable information was obtained which will help us determine the methods to eventually remove fuel debris”.
Toshiba’s scorpion-like robot (above) was sent into reactor 2 in February, but was unable to reach its desired destination due to its path being blocked. It was then exposed to more than five times its anticipated radiation exposure limit in just two hours. Although it did manage to get temperature readings and radiation levels, it was unfit to capture images showing the core or the location of the nuclear rods.
Two other expensive probes met an untimely end in the power plant after getting stuck and being starved of fuel.
The Scorpion mishap, two hours into an exploration that was supposed to last 10 hours, underlined the scale and difficulty of decommissioningFukushimaDaiichi – an unprecedented undertaking one expert has described as “almost beyond comprehension”.
Cleaning up the plant, scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl after it was struck by a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on the afternoon of 11 March 2011, is expected to take 30 to 40 years, at a costJapan’s trade and industry ministry recently estimated at 21.5tr yen ($189bn).
The figure, which includes compensating tens of thousands of evacuees, is nearly double an estimate released three years ago.
Thetsunami killed almost 19,000 people, most of them in areas north of Fukushima, and forced 160,000 people living near the plant to flee their homes. Six years on, only a small number havereturned to areas deemed safeby the authorities.

Developing robots capable of penetrating the most dangerous parts of Fukushima Daiichi’s reactors – and spending enough time there to obtain crucial data – is proving a near-impossible challenge for Tepco. The Scorpion – so called because of its camera-mounted folding tail – “died” after stalling along a rail beneath the reactor pressure vessel, its path blocked by lumps of fuel and other debris.
The device, along with other robots, may also have been damaged by an unseen enemy: radiation. Before it was abandoned, its dosimeter indicated that radiation levels inside the No 2 containment vessel were at 250 sieverts an hour. In an earlier probe using a remote-controlled camera, radiation at about the same spot was as high as 650 sieverts an hour – enough to kill a human within a minute.
Shunji Uchida, the Fukushima Daiichi plant manager, concedes that Tepco acquired “limited” knowledge about the state of the melted fuel. “So far we’ve only managed to take a peek, as the last experiment with the robot didn’t go well,” he tells the Guardian and other media on a recent visit to the plant. “But we’re not thinking of another approach at this moment.”
Robotic mishaps aside, exploration work in the two other reactors, where radiation levels are even higher than in reactor No 2, has barely begun. There are plans to send a tiny waterproof robot into reactor No 1 in the next few weeks, but no date has been set for the more seriously damaged reactor No 3.
Naohiro Masuda, the president of Fukushima Daiichi’s decommissioning arm, says he wants another probe sent in before deciding on how to remove the melted fuel.

Despite the setbacks, Tepco insists it will begin extracting the melted fuel in 2021 – a decade after the disaster – after consulting government officials this summer.
But Shaun Burnie, a senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Germany who is based inJapan, describes the challenge confronting the utility as “unprecedented and almost beyond comprehension”, adding that the decommissioning schedule was “never realistic or credible”.
The latest aborted exploration of reactor No 2 “only reinforces that reality”, Burnie says. “Without a technical solution for dealing with unit one or three, unit two was seen as less challenging. So much of what is communicated to the public and media is speculation and wishful thinking on the part of industry and government.
“The current schedule for the removal of hundreds of tons of molten nuclear fuel, the location and condition of which they still have no real understanding, was based on the timetable of prime minister [Shinzo] Abe in Tokyo and the nuclear industry – not the reality on the ground and based on sound engineering and science.”
Even Shunichi Tanaka, the chairman of Japan’s nuclear regulation authority, does not appear to share Tepco’s optimism that it will stick to its decommissioning roadmap. “It is still early to talk in such an optimistic way,” he says. “At the moment, we are still feeling around in the dark.”
On the surface, much has changed since theGuardian’s first visit to Fukushima Daiichifive years ago.
Then, the site was still strewn with tsunami wreckage. Hoses, pipes and building materials covered the ground, as thousands of workers braved high radiation levels to bring a semblance of order to the scene of a nuclear disaster.
Six years later, damaged reactor buildings have been reinforced, and more than 1,300 spent fuel assemblies have beensafely removedfrom a storage pool in reactor No 4. The ground has been covered with a special coating to prevent rainwater from adding toTepco’s water-management woes.
Workers who once had to change into protective gear before they approached Fukushima Daiichi now wear light clothing and simple surgical masks in most areas of the plant. The 6,000 workers, including thousands of contract staff, can now eat hot meals and take breaks at a “rest house” that opened in 2015.
But further up the hill from the coastline, row upon row of steel tanks are a reminder of the decommissioning effort’s other great nemesis: contaminated water. The tanks now hold about 900,000 tons of water, with the quantity soon expected to reach 1m tons.
Tepco’s once-vauntedunderground ice wall, built at a cost of 24.5bn yen, has so far failed to completely prevent groundwater from leaking into the reactor basements and mixing with radioactive coolant water.

The structure, which freezes the soil to a depth of 30 metres, is still allowing 150 tonnes of groundwater to seep into the reactor basements every day, said Yuichi Okamura, a Tepco spokesman. Five sections have been kept open deliberately to prevent water inside the reactor basements from rising and flowing out more rapidly. “We have to close the wall gradually,” Okamura said. “By April we want to keep the influx of groundwater to about 100 tonnes a day, and to eliminate all contaminated water on the site by 2020.”
Critics of the clean-up note that 2020 is the year Tokyo is due to host the Olympics, having been awarded the Games after Abe assured the International Olympic Committee that Fukushima was“under control”.
Mitsuhiko Tanaka, a former Babcock-Hitachi nuclear engineer, accuses Abe and other government officials of playing down the severity of the decommissioning challenge in an attempt to win public support for therestart of nuclear reactorsacross the country.
“Abe said Fukushima was under control when he went overseas to promote the Tokyo Olympics, but he never said anything like that in Japan,” says Tanaka. “Anyone here could see that the situation was not under control.
“If people of Abe’s stature repeat something often enough, it becomes accepted as the truth.”

"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi headlined Madison Square Garden Sunday, capping off a busy weekend in New York. Modi addressed the United Nations General Assembly Friday and spoke at the Global Citizen Festival, which drew a crowd of more than 50,000, at Central Park Saturday.
The New York Times said Modi received a “rock star’s reception” in New York after having his visa revoked by the U. S. State Department in 2005 for his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots that killed more than 1,000 people.
The crowd was warmed up by “Bollywood-style” acts, the Associated Press reported. Modi’s speech at Madison Square Garden covered ways to improve India’s economy, government transparency and an optimistic outlook for the future of the country. Modi also discussed practical concerns for India, such as cleaner conditions and the construction of millions of toilets, the Wall Street Journal reported.
“We will do our best to bring change and development in India. We assure you that the government will not do anything to defame India,” Modi said during his speech.
Modi’s tone was optimistic as he discussed change, the youth culture of India and the expectations for the government following his landslide victory in May. The prime minister said India could succeed as it has democracy, youth and demand, the combination of which is unique to the country, reports WSJ.
India’s Mars mission was also a topic during Modi’s speech. At a cost of just $74 million, the Mangalyaan satellite entered Mars’ orbit Wednesday. “India is the first country in the world which made it to Mars in its maiden attempt and America and India are even talking in Mars,” Modi said.
Modi’s speech drew hundreds of protesters and nearly 1,000 watched the speech at Times Square, the AP said. Modi is to meet with President Barack Obama Monday.",1
"(Before It's News)A kauri tree preserved in a New Zealand peat swamp for 30,000 years has revealed a new mechanism that may explain how temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere spiked several degrees centigrade in just a few decades during the last global ice age.
Unexpectedly, according to new research led by scientists from Keele University and UNSW Sydney and published today in Nature Communications, it looks like the origin of this warming may lie half-a-world away, in Antarctica.
Rapid warming spikes of this kind during glacial periods, called Dansgaard-Oeschger events, are well known to climate researchers. They are linked to a phenomenon known as the ‘bipolar seesaw’, where increasing temperatures in the Arctic happen at the same time as cooling over the Antarctic, and vice versa. Close up kauri log
(Before It's News)A kauri tree preserved in a New Zealand peat swamp for 30,000 years has revealed a new mechanism that may explain how temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere spiked several degrees centigrade in just a few decades during the last global ice age.

Until now, these divergences in temperature at the opposite ends of the Earth were believed to have been driven by changes in the North Atlantic, causing deep ocean currents, often referred to as the ocean ‘conveyor belt’, to shut down. This led to warming in the Northern Hemisphere and cooling in the south.
But the study, which examines a specific Dansgaard-Oeschger event that occurred around 30,000 years ago, suggests Antarctica plays a role too. Professor Chris Fogwill, Head of the School of Geography, Geology and the Environment at Keele University and co-author of the study said:
“The study analysed highly-resolved climate archives from ancient trees which have been preserved in marshland, by assessing the records against climate models our study provides fresh insights into the mechanisms of climate change, which are crucial to reduce uncertainty in future climate projections.”
The paper describes how the researchers used a detailed sequence of radiocarbon dates from an ancient New Zealand kauri tree to precisely align ice, marine and sediment records across a period of greatly changing climate.
“Intriguingly, we found that the spike in temperature preserved in the Greenland ice core corresponded with a 400-year-long surface cooling period in the Southern Ocean and a major retreat of Antarctic ice,” said lead author and UNSW scientist Professor Chris Turney.
“As we looked more closely for the cause of this opposite response we found that there were no changes to the global ocean circulation during the Antarctic cooling event that could explain the warming in the North Atlantic. There had to be another cause.”
A clue to what might be going on if the oceans weren’t involved appeared in lake sediments from the Atherton Tableland, Queensland. The sediments showed a simultaneous collapse of rain-bearing trade winds over tropical northeast Australia.
It was a curious change, so the researchers turned to climate models to see if these climate events might somehow be linked.
They started by modelling the release of large volumes of freshwater into the Southern Ocean, exactly as would happen with rapid ice retreat around the Antarctic. Consistent with the data, they found that there was cooling in the Southern Ocean but no change in the global ocean circulation.
They also found that the freshwater pulse caused rapid warming in the tropical Pacific. This in turn led to changes to the atmospheric circulation that went on to trigger sharply higher temperatures over the North Atlantic and the collapse of rain-bearing winds over tropical Australia.
Essentially, the model showed the formation of a 20,000 km long “atmospheric bridge” that linked melting ice in Antarctica to rapid atmospheric warming in the North Atlantic.
“This study again demonstrates that events in the remote Antarctic and Southern Ocean region are directly linked to global climate, and cannot been seen in isolation.”
“Our study shows just how important Antarctica’s ice is to the climate of the rest of the world and reveals how rapid melting of the ice here can affect us all. This is something we need to be acutely aware of in a warming world,” Professor Turney said.
It also showed how deeply the climate was linked across great distances said fellow author and climate modeller from the University of Tasmania, Dr Stephen Phipps.
“Our research has revealed yet another remarkable example of the interconnections that are so much a part of our climate system,” Dr Phipps said.
“By combining past records of past events with climate modelling, we see how a change in one region can have major climatic impacts at the opposite ends of the Earth.”

"This protective field acts as a barrier that protects the Earth from harmful cosmic radiation, while protecting our planet from solar waves go directly toward Earth.
Scientists at MIT have found that there is an invisible field that protects our planet. This mysterious invisible field sounds like something from a science fiction movie.
It prevents harmful cosmic radiation that enters our atmosphere and was first noticed by two NASA spacecraft that are orbiting the Van Allen radiation belt at a height of 11,000 kilometers above the Earth.
This invisible force field blocks the highly radioactive electrons from the highest layer of Earth’s atmosphere. According to information from NASA, these “high energy” electrons are very aggressive and moving through space at close to the speed of light. They are very dangerous because they cannot fry anything with which they come into contact from the satellite to the spacecraft.
To learn more about this field, NASA launched two probes, the so-called Van Allen probes, wishing to research these electrons and to increase the safety of astronauts and equipment to be sent into space.
NASA states that the Earth’s magnetic field attracts these particles toward our planet. However, they cannot approach the planet to less than 10,000 kilometers, thanks to an invisible protective field that had never been detected.
This force field acts as a barrier that protects the Earth from harmful cosmic radiation, while protecting our planet from solar waves go directly toward Earth.
Scientists believe that the enigmatic field works on the principle of low-frequency electromagnetic fields, but its source is still a mystery.
For example, they noted that the Earth’s magnetic field over South America, although significantly lower barriers and above that work equally protects the Earth from harmful cosmic radiation.
The researchers continued to research and found that the most likely source of barriers to the existence of long-range radio waves on the planet. However, they are wrong again after they realized that the waves tend to react with neutral electrons and are not helpful in the fight against ultra relative particles.
They continued their research and found that the barrier is most likely created because of the phenomenon known as “plasmaspheric hiss” that occurs in the upper atmosphere of our planet.
This phenomenon helps orbit in repelling dangerous fast moving action of particles, directing them to the parallel road to one of the lines of the magnetic field of our planet, which is why they fall into the atmosphere and collide with neutral charged particles, which eventually disappear.",1
"In what one expert called an unusual move for a software company, Microsoft Canada has chipped in a reward for help in finding a gaming-addicted Ontario teenager who ran away from home three weeks ago, after his parents took his Xbox away.
Brandon Crisp had once been a competitive hockey player who got good grades and enjoyed video games with his friends in typical teenage fashion. But since the 15-year-old disappeared on Oct. 13, Canada's Thanksgiving holiday, the bright 10th-grader's family is sick with worry, his father said.
Now Microsoft Canada is offering a reward of $25,000 Canadian for information leading to Brandon's return, matching the $25,000 Canadian raised by local organizations. The reward totals $41,776 in U. S. dollars.
When the family signed up about a year ago for a subscription to Xbox Live, which allows players to interact with gamers all over the world, Brandon's hobby turned into an obsession that ultimately led to his fleeing his Barrie home after his father took away the system for good, his father said.
""We'd be asleep and he'd be up at two or three in the morning, playing this thing,"" his father, Steve Crisp, told ABCNews.com, adding that they also had a hard time getting him to leave the game to eat dinner with the family.
On Friday, Oct. 10, the Crisps learned the boy, whose grades were slipping, had skipped school the day before, and they decided to take away his Xbox temporarily, as they had about 20 times before, Steve Crisp said. But when Crisp saw that Brandon had found the system and resumed playing it while his father was out fishing that weekend, he said he decided to take it away permanently.
""He was very angry,"" Crisp said. When the father and son sat down to talk about Brandon's obsession with the system, the game ""Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"" in particular, Brandon's response was ""OK, I'm going to leave home then.""
Calling his son's bluff, Crisp said he advised him to take warm clothes when he saw Brandon loading things into a backpack. He then watched as his only son rode away on his bicycle. The family, which includes Brandon's twin sister and older sister, figured he'd blow off some steam with friends and be back that evening.
""I didn't think anyone would run off for a game,"" Crisp said.
Brandon was last seen on a heavily traveled trail around 5:45 p.m. that evening. There has been no trace of him since. His bicycle was found that night with a flat tire.
Police, with Microsoft Canada's cooperation, had looked into who Brandon may have come in contact with through ""Call of Duty 4,"" despite privacy laws to protect gamers.
""At this point the investigation would lead us to believe there is no connection to the Xbox,"" Barrie Police Service Sgt. Dave Goodbrand said yesterday.
Microsoft Canada issued a statement, saying, """"Like everyone, we are deeply worried about the disappearance of Brandon Crisp. Law enforcement has contacted Microsoft about this matter and we are cooperating fully with them. We are unable to comment further on the nature of our cooperation because of the ongoing investigation.
""As has been reported, Microsoft has matched the existing reward of $25,000 for information leading to Brandon's return,"" the statement continued. ""Our thoughts are with Brandon, his family and his community and we hope for his swift return.""
Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment about why the company contributed to the reward.
Gaming addiction has seen a rise in the last several years, especially among male teens and young men, according to Coleen Moore, coordinator of resource development at the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery in Peoria, Ill.
The gaming addicts typically treated at the institute in both inpatient and outpatient programs are teens between the ages of 16 and 18 and men between 20 and 24.
Moore said Brandon was not the first teen to become addicted to Xbox Live, a system that she said more and more people in the institute's programs are mentioning.
""The big thing that is the draw that these guys talk about it being able to create their own personas and compete with others all over the world,"" she said.
Gaming addiction progresses like any other addiction, until the person is obsessed with creating the feeling of euphoria the gaming brings, she said. Some addicts spend up to 20 hours a day gaming, and Moore said one patient remembered turned to cocaine as a stimulant to keep playing.
Moore, who was not familiar with Brandon's case, said the teen seemed to have the typical progression of addiction, but that his parents did exactly the right thing in setting limits and trying to strike a balance between entertainment and obsession.
But if the teens are not able to stick with those limits, she said, ""I would suggest they get some type of professional help.""
Moore said she was surprised, but pleased that Microsoft Canada put up reward money since the industry has typically shied away from addressing the problems of gaming addiction.
""I'm kind of dumbfounded,"" she said. ""They don't have any responsibility to whether or not someone becomes addicted to it.""
In trying to find Brandon, the Crisps and police had appealed to the local media and, in return, have gotten nationwide interest in his case. He was also featured in a segment of Fox's ""America's Most Wanted"" television show.
Goodbrand said the entire situation was very strange, noting that Brandon was a good student and came from a good family.",0
"The economy gained 261,000 jobs in October, adding back thousands of positions after hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit the labor force in September, according to the Department of Labor's monthly jobs report.
It’s not the headline number the market was expecting — some had pegged Friday's figure at 400,000 — but it nonetheless shows steady growth. The economy has added an average of 139,000 jobs in the last two months, continuing its record-breaking streak of 85 months of gains.
Unemployment levels dropped to 4.1 percent in October, the lowest rate since December 2000 — though last month's figures reflect a 765,000-strong decrease in labor force participation.
Wages continued their enduring riddle, staying almost flat with an annual increase of just 2.4 percent. Observers are keen to see higher salaries in order to stimulate consumer spending.
Friday's data is the latest indication that the economy remains on a steady upward trajectory, and could effectively seal the deal for a quarter-point rate increase by the Federal Reserve in December. The central bank declined to make any further adjustment to the interest rate after its November meeting this week, having already spiked rates twice this year.

"Visitors to the Grand Canyon and other popular national parks may soon feel sticker shock when they pull up to the entrance gates.
The National Park Service is considering a steep increase in entrance fees at 17 of its most popular parks, mostly in the U. S. West, to address a backlog of maintenance and infrastructure projects.
Visitors to the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Zion and other national parks would be charged $70 per vehicle, up from the fee of $30 for a weekly pass. At others, the hike is nearly triple, from $25 to $70.
A 30-day public comment period opened Tuesday. The Park Service says it expects to raise $70 million a year with the proposal at a time when national parks repeatedly have been breaking visitation records and putting a strain on park resources. Nearly 6 million people visited the Grand Canyon last year.
""We need to have a vision to look at the future of our parks and take action in order to ensure that our grandkids' grandkids will have the same if not better experience than we have today,"" Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement. ""Shoring up our parks' aging infrastructure will do that.""
Annual $80 passes for federal lands would not change, though fees would go up for pedestrians and motorcyclists. The higher fees would apply only during the five busiest contiguous months for parks, for most that's May through September when many families are on vacation.
The proposal would not affect several free weekends and holidays at parks throughout the year.
It comes not long after many of the parks that charge entrance fees raised them. The rationale is the same this time around — to address a backlog of maintenance and infrastructure projects.
The Park Service estimated deferred maintenance across its parks at $11.3 billion as of September 2016, down from $11.9 billion in 2015.
Kevin Dahl, Arizona senior program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association, said maintenance costs should fall to Congress, not visitors.
""We've supported increases at the parks, they are a huge value for the price of entrance,"" he said. ""But we want to look closely at this and we want local communities to look closely at this to see if it would impact visitation because we don't want to price people out of the parks.""
Latino Outdoors founder Jose Gonzalez said the need for revenue and to control the crowds at the busiest parks is understandable but he questioned the potential impact.
""If there isn't always a question or consideration of equitable access to a lot of communities, it's only going to increase the disparity in terms of who is able to access our national parks and public lands,"" he said.
Not all Park Service sites charge entrance fees. The 118 that do keep 80 percent of revenue for things like fixing restrooms, signs, trails, exhibits and campgrounds and send 20 percent into a pot to help other free park sites.
Erik and Janet Schwartz of Boston said regular maintenance is vital for enjoying national parks. The couple was wrapping up a four-week trip that included visits to Bryce, Zion and the Grand Canyon.
The entrance fees are a bargain considering the vastness of the parks, they said, but they also want assurance the revenue is used as intended.
""If they have the true justification for that, then I think preserving these lands for future generations is absolutely critical,"" Erik Schwartz said.
Flagstaff resident Brittany Montague said the proposed increase is ""completely unreasonable,"" especially for young families and those making a day trip to national parks. If the cost included a guided tour or family photo, ""it might make it worth it,"" she said.
The proposal applies to Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands and Zion in Utah; Yosemite, Sequoia & Kings Canyon and Joshua Tree in California; Grand Teton and Yellowstone in Wyoming; Mount Rainier and Olympic in Washington; Shenandoah in Virginia; Acadia in Maine; Rocky Mountain in Colorado; the Grand Canyon in Arizona; and Denali in Alaska.
Denali is structured differently because it's largely a drive-through park. The vehicle fee doesn't apply. The proposed increase per person is from $10 to $30.",0
"People have a tendency to collect things. Whether it’s items of sentimental value, little knick-knacks, or simply small things we find fascinating, humans can collect and store things to the point where they don’t even realize their true worth.

The blanket, described by the television appraiser as a “first-phase Navajo Chief blanket”, was said to be worth an extraordinary $350,000 to $500,000.
L. T., who owned a very similar blanket, was in complete shock.
“[The blanket] looks just like it,” he explained. “I’m holding it up, holding it up to the TV. But I never thought mine would be worth anything close to that. I mean, maybe it might be worth $10,000, $15,000.”
According to PBS, the Navajo native tribe began making its own wool in the mid-17th century. As this wool industry progressed, the Navajo eventually became one of the most skilled weavers of the time, even surpassing the famous Spanish and Pueblo craftsmen. The Navajo’s tight blankets were weaved so tightly they were “practically waterproof”, and they became known as “Chief blankets” as a result of their extravagant price.
An expert in Navajo weavings explains to PBS that in 1860, “Guys are making $5 a week if they’re lucky, about half that if they’re blue collar.” The price of a Navajo blanket in that time? Anywhere between $100 and $150 dollars. “First-phase” blankets are the earliest style of Navajo Chief blankets and are easily identified by their simple, striped design. According to experts, the value of first-phase blankets is a result of their rarity—less than 50 have survived the trials of time.
Despite the value of authentic Navajo Chief blankets, not even auctioneers could have guessed that L. T’s first-phase Navajo blanket would sell for OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS, making his a rags-to-riches story of a lifetime.",1
"BOSTON— Hackers released an email from HBO in which the company said it was willing to pay them $250,000 as part of a negotiation over electronic data swiped from the pay-TV company's servers.
The July 27 email was sent by John Beyler, an HBO executive who thanked the hackers for ""making us aware"" of previously unknown security vulnerabilities. The executive asked for a one-week delay and said HBO was willing to make a ""good faith"" payment of $250,000, calling it a ""bug bounty"" reward for IT professionals rather than a ransom.
Beyler's email to the hackers said the company was working ""very hard"" to review all the material they provided, and also trying to figure out a way to make a large transaction in bitcoin, the hackers' preferred payment method.
""You have the advantage of having surprised us,"" Beyler wrote. ""In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.""
HBO declined to comment. A person close to the investigation confirmed the authenticity of the email, saying it was an attempt to buy time and assess the situation.
In the breach, which became public July 31, hackers stole 1.5 terabytes of programming and internal communications. They have since posted scripts from several ""Game of Thrones"" episodes, including one that was unreleased, episodes of ""Ballers"" and ""Room 104,"" and a month's worth of emails appearing to be from Leslie Cohen, HBO's vice president for film programming.
Internal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives, also were released. The hackers have demanded a multi-million dollar ransom.
Whether or not HBO ever intended to follow through with its $250,000 offer, the email raised questions Friday among security professionals about the importance of the data as well as how it will affect future attacks.
""It's interesting that they're spinning it as a bug bounty program,"" said Pablo Garcia, CEO of FFRI North America, based in Aliso Viejo, California. ""They're being extorted. If it was a bug bounty, it'd be on the up and up.""
HBO has said that it is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity firms to investigate the attack, which is the latest to hit a Hollywood business.
The leaks so far have fallen well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In April, a hacker claimed to have released episodes of Netflix's ""Orange is the New Black"" ahead of their official launch date.
But paying ransoms to hackers can be dangerous because it shows that being a bad-guy hacker is a good business, said cybersecurity expert Oren Falkowitz, CEO of Redwood City, California-based Area 1 Security. Companies would be better off investing in preventing email spear-fishing attempts and other hacking techniques, he said.
""The reason they got in this scenario is they didn't have the right pre-emption strategy,"" Falkowitz said. ""The next company, whether it's Showtime or Death Row Records or whomever, needs to see that they're going to wake up one day to this reality unless they confront it.""",0

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is neuro-immune disorder so rare, little is known about causation.  ADEM is a result of inflammation in the myelin sheath, which is the electromagnetic coating that protects nerves in the brain and the spinal cord. Over 50% of those afflicted with this devastating diagnosis are struck while fighting an existing bacterial or viral infection. According to the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute, ADEM will “on occasion . . . occur after a vaccination . . . usually after the MMR.”  National Vaccine Injury Lawyer Leah Durant has reported that ADEM, although rare, can also be triggered by a flu shot.
That’s what happened to little Marysue Grivna, a vivacious, active nine year old from Tampa, Florida. On November 20, 2013, Marysue had a seasonal flu shot. Within days, she became limp, then paralyzed and, as reported by Natural News, “nonverbal, confined to a wheelchair/hospital bed, [and] primarily eating via a g-tube. . .”  According to Myelitis.org, ADEM is a rare auto-immune disease that occurs when the immune system “mistakenly attacks its own brain tissue,” when responding to a vaccination or infection.
Television host Nancy Grace reported on this case and, surprisingly, learned on the air that pharmaceutical companies are not liable for any damages.
This protection given to Big Pharma’s vaccines is a gift that keeps on giving. In the 1970s and 1980s, as reported by the Historyofvaccines.org, there were many big payouts to families damaged by vaccines, “particularly from the combined diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT).” These lawsuits were so successful that many pharmaceutical manufacturers stopped producing vaccines. Congress stepped in. In 1986, they removed any liability from Big Pharma and created a National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP).  To this day, families like the parents of Marysue Grivna, must apply for compensation through the NVICP by first filing a “claim with the U.S. Court of Claims.”  Since the program began, over 17,000 petitions have been filed, 14000 adjudicated, nearly 1o,ooo cases dismissed and only 4687 cases have been compensated for their vaccine injury.   Since 1988, $3.3 billion has been paid to victims of vaccine injury.  Compare that to the billions upon billions made by the pharmaceutical companies on the global use of vaccines.
Apparently none of that payout has been applied to little Marysue, whose family has endured this tragedy for nearly three years. Their once beautiful child, who spoke two languages, played, laughed and was fully alive, now lives in diapers, is fed with a feeding tube and is completely dependent. The family is still raising funds to provide their daughter with an accessible bathroom, bedroom and a new electric wheelchair and a wheelchair van. In an interview with Tampa Bay’s ABC news in February 2016, it was reported that her devoted parents refuse to put Marysue in a long term rehabilitation, but do utilize a local rehab facility for a few hours each day. Her mother Carla works outside the home, while father Steven works as the primary care giver. His daughter now weighs seventy pounds and, although he needs surgery for neck problems, he’s put all that on hold to care for his daughter.
Now, more than ever, it’s imperative to consider healthy alternatives to build one’s immune system and ever so carefully make informed choices concerning vaccines.

"In the wake of the current water crisis in Flint, Michigan, USA today reported that an estimated six million Americans havedrinking water contaminatedwith much higher levels of lead than allowed by federal guidelines.
Yahoo News reports that the crisis in Flint may only be the tip of the proverbial lead-tainted-water-crisis “iceberg”:
With the nation focused on a major crisis in Flint, Michigan, where lead from aging pipes leached into the municipal water supply, the newspaper launched an investigation which found higher than acceptable lead levels in about 2,000 water systems across the United States.
Tainted water was supplied to hundreds of daycare centers and schools, the report said.
Children are the population most vulnerable to the pernicious effects of lead, a toxin which affects the neurological system and can lead to permanent learning delays and behavioral problems.
Higher than allowed lead levels were found in all 50 US states, USA Today reported.
A sample of water drawn from one elementary school in Maine found lead levels some 42 times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency limit of 15 parts per billion, while a preschool in Pennsylvania recorded lead levels 14 times higher than allowed.
An elementary school in Ithaca, New York tested earlier this year showed 5,000 parts per billion of lead — a level so high it met the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s designation for “hazardous waste.”
More than 8,000 children in Flint, economically devastated by shutdowns and layoffs in the car industry, were exposed to lead for more than a year before the tap water contamination was uncovered by citizen activists.
The news report was published as Michigan Governor Rick Snyder prepared to appear Thursday before a congressional oversight committee probing the Flint crisis.
Critics are calling for the resignation of Snyder, who ordered water from the Flint River to be diverted to supply water to the city, in a cost-cutting measure.
Experts believe that the chemical-laced Flint River water corroded lead-bearing pipes, allowing large amounts of the chemical element to leach into the city’s water.",1
"Instead of redoing the entire apartment, she added, “we put some things on hold in order to invest in the materials that really made us happy, and we know they will last.” Another budget-conscious decision: buying the cabinetry, hardware and light fixtures at Ikea, where they spent just $5,000 for all of it.
Of course, there were hiccups along the way. The floor slabs, for example, turned out to be too long to fit inside the elevator. To get them up to the 12th floor, they had to be cut and then reassembled upstairs. The lesson? “Think through all the details of the entire process,” Ms. Oktay advised.
Open to the living room but split off by a tiled floor with a raised border, the L-shaped kitchen in Sarah Lantz and Becky Froman’s apartment was overdue for an update. “People would trip over the lip created by the border of the floor tiles,” said Ms. Lantz, 37, a vice president of a financial services firm. (Ms. Froman, 37, her wife, is a senior manager at Showtime Networks.) So after saving up $35,000 to cover the project, the couple gave up their kitchen for about three months in the summer of 2015, hiding out in the bedroom to escape the dust and noise.
Out went the old appliances, dated cabinets and kitchen tiles. In came white Caesarstone counters, walnut cabinetry and new flooring carefully chosen to match the parquet in the living area. A center island was added for more storage and counter space, and open shelving was installed along one wall to create an open, airy feel. To achieve the natural-wood look they wanted without going over budget, they bought Ikea cabinet backings and finished them with doors from Semihandmade, a company that specializes in making reasonably priced doors that fit Ikea cabinets. To improve the apartment’s flow, they broke through a wall to open the kitchen to the hallway.
In the end, all that work paid off. The couple, who are expecting a baby, listed the apartment in May for $599,000. A bidding war ensued, with Liz McDonough, an architect, winning the unit for about $700,000. “The layout was definitely most important to me,” said Ms. McDonough, who moved in at the end of the summer. “I liked this kitchen because it had just been renovated in a functional, yet simple, minimal way.”
By the time Sanaya Kaufman and Christopher Irish had saved enough money to renovate their kitchen, it was long past its prime. “We registered for a kitchen fund when we got married” — in 2012 — “and finally were able to renovate in 2013,” said Ms. Kaufman, 37, the vice president of development at Friends of the High Line. (Mr. Irish, 37, is a bar and restaurant owner.) “It was a very outdated kitchen, in rough shape.”
Rather than opening the kitchen to the living room, as their neighbors did, the couple decided to keep most of the walls intact, but to use the space more efficiently, adding cabinets to the ceiling, replacing the flooring, upgrading appliances. The only wall they removed was the one between the kitchen and the pantry, because it crowded the space.
“I like the look of the ‘big room,’” said Ms. Kaufman, who declined to reveal how much they spent. “But I also like not looking at the kitchen all the time.” The renovation, which took about six weeks, included installing white Shaker-style cabinets, gray Caesarstone counters, a penny-tile backsplash and cork floors.
Because they decided to keep the kitchen separate from the rest of their living space, it was easy to convert the adjacent dining area into a second bedroom, for their 2-year-old daughter. In October, the couple listed the apartment for $599,000; they plan to close in March, and are now in the process of moving into a bigger apartment in the same complex. That kitchen will also require a renovation.

"There’s Julian Assange and the WikiLeaks, who strategically released email after email, exposing the DNC’s massive corruption. He helped shed light on the massive corruption going on at the highest levels of government with his classified leaks. There have been heroes such as Seth Rich, who conspiracy theorists have suggested was murdered after leaking said emails to Julian Assange—many have been pushing for a federal investigation into this supposed “accidental” murder just 5 days after the documents were copied.
There have been heroes such as Seth Rich, who conspiracy theorists have suggested was murdered after leaking said emails to Julian Assange—many have been pushing for a federal investigation into this supposed “accidental” murder just 5 days after the documents were copied.
Now, however, the new string of attacks against the DNC has been via anonymous accounts on Twitter. It’s a genius plan, really—Twitter’s nature and high conservative follower count allow information to spread like WILDFIRE.
And once it’s picked up by a bigger fish, like Cernovich, Baked Alaska, or Laura Loomer, it’s game over for liberals. Millions of conservatives will instantly be informed of the high level Democratic corruption, and Twitter won’t be able to stop the rapid spread of its awareness.
This is likely why an anonymous hacker recently chose to dump a whopping 28,000 private Hillary emails via his Twitter account:
Twitter users were initially skeptical, with some suggesting that the files may lead to a virus, but after being verified by several high profile users, a massive onslaught of re-tweets began.
Since then, several major news outlets have picked up on the story, and it’s only a matter of time before Donald Trump sees the message which was specifically tweeted at him, implying that he now has an obligation to prosecute Hillary.
This is, in fact, what he promised to do. We all remember his famous one-liner, when Hillary Clinton said it was good someone with his temperament wasn’t in charge of our country, to which he responded: “Because you’d be in jail.”
There was INSTANTLY a roar of applause, for no politician had previously had the COURAGE to attack that vile woman. Now, the tables have turned, and with more and more information leaking out each month, it’s only a matter of time before Hillary is thrown in prison.
Disobedient Mediareports on the leaked files, explaining how it’s impossible that Russia could’ve hacked them:
“IMPORTANTLY, THE FORENSICATOR CONCLUDED THAT THE CHANCE THAT THE FILES HAD BEEN ACCESSED AND DOWNLOADED REMOTELY OVER THE INTERNET WERE TOO SMALL TO GIVE THIS IDEA ANY SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. HE EXPLAINED THAT THE CALCULATED TRANSFER SPEEDS FOR THE INITIAL COPY WERE MUCH FASTER THAN CAN BE SUPPORTED BY AN INTERNET CONNECTION.”
“THIS IS EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT AND COMPLETELY DISCREDITS ALLEGATIONS OF RUSSIAN HACKING MADE BY BOTH GUCCIFER 2.0 AND CROWDSTRIKE.”
“THIS CONCLUSION IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY ANALYSIS OF THE OVERALL TRANSFER RATE OF 23 MB/S.THE FORENSICATORDESCRIBED THIS AS ‘POSSIBLE WHEN COPYING OVER A LAN, BUT TOO FAST TO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO THAT THE ALLEGED DNC DATA WAS INITIALLY COPIED OVER THE INTERNET (ESP. TO ROMANIA).’“
“GUCCIFER 2.0 HAD CLAIMED TO ORIGINATE IN ROMANIA. SO IN OTHER WORDS, THIS RATE INDICATES THAT THE DATA WAS DOWNLOADED LOCALLY, POSSIBLY USING THE LOCAL DNC NETWORK. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS FINDING IN REGARDS TO DESTROYING THE RUSSIAN HACKING NARRATIVE CANNOT BE OVERSTATED.”
“IF THE DATA IS CORRECT, THEN THE FILES COULD NOT HAVE BEEN COPIED OVER A REMOTE CONNECTION AND SO THEREFORE CANNOT HAVE BEEN ‘HACKED BY RUSSIA.’ ”
BOOM! This is a massive bombshell that the American public NEEDS to know about. Not only is this vault FILLED with over 28,000 emails illegally sent by Hillary Clinton over her private server, but it also contains within it PROOF that the whole “Russian hackers” narrative spread by the MSM is a BLATANT LIE!",1
"A DEBATE has raged this year about whether the Republican effort on taxes should be described as “tax reform”—which implies improving efficiency and fairness–or just “tax cuts”. Parts of the tax bill released, at long last, by House Republicans on November 2nd are worthy of the first title. The tax bill aggressively takes on deductions in the individual income tax code, and channels the proceeds towards across-the-board cuts in income tax. Unfortunately, that good work is undone by expensive giveaways to the owners of firms, and unnecessary windfalls to the heirs of the rich. As a result, the bill would saddle the economy with more debt, and could end up being a drag on growth.
Start with the good stuff. Republicans want to mostly scrap the state and local deduction, an unwarranted federal subsidy for states that levy high taxes (see article). Displaying an admirable willingness to go after even popular tax breaks, they would curtail the deduction for mortgage interest payments, which flows mostly to the rich and distorts the economy towards housing. The deduction would be limited to $500,000 of mortgage borrowing, down from $1m today. Numerous smaller deductions would go too. And a big increase in the standard deduction, the amount that can be earned before paying tax, will greatly reduce the incentive to take advantage of itemised deductions in the first place (Americans must pick one or the other).
That all makes the tax code more efficient, and helps to pay for across-the-board cuts in marginal tax rates. Contrary to Democrats’ talking points, most middle-class families can expect to see a tax cut, although some families with children will probably lose out owing to the scrapping of personal exemptions (amounts that can be earned tax-free on account of household size). Meanwhile, the top income tax rate of 39.6% would stay in place, though it would kick in at $1m for married couples, rather than $470,000 under current law.
The problem is that Republicans plan bigger cuts to business taxes than are affordable, especially after abandoning plans to raise money via so-called “border-adjustment”. The corporate tax rate would fall to 20%, permanently, at great expense. The rate for so-called “pass-through” businesses, whose owners, unlike shareholders in corporations, need not pay further taxes on their investment profits, would be 25%. This, and the abolition of the estate (inheritance) tax, which only falls on estates worth more than $5.5m, all contribute to the supposed $1.5trn cost of the bill over ten years.
In the long run, the addition to the national debt will crowd out private investment and inhibit economic growth. The Tax Policy Center modelled the earlier sketch plan put out by Republicans and found that after four decades, GDP would be 0.4% lower, because of the increased debt burden. This is one reason to be suspicious of the White House’s claim that corporate tax cuts will cause wages to rise by $4,000 for the average family. The American economy is approaching full employment and does not need a fiscal stimulus package (on this point, I would recommend the Tax Foundation’s blog on the “folk theory” of how tax cuts help the economy). The House Republicans’ tax bill has plenty of good features. But its lack of fiscal prudence is its undoing.",0
"(Before It's News)Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the ancestors of modern humans diverged from an archaic lineage that gave rise to Neanderthals and Denisovans. Yet the evolutionary relationships between these groups remain unclear.
A University of Utah-led team developed a new method for analyzing DNA sequence data to reconstruct the early history of the archaic human populations. They revealed an evolutionary story that contradicts conventional wisdom about modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans.
The study found that the Neanderthal-Denisovan lineage nearly went extinct after separating from modern humans. Just 300 generations later, Neanderthals and Denisovans diverged from each other around 744,000 years ago. Then, the global Neanderthal population grew to tens of thousands of individuals living in fragmented, isolated populations scattered across Eurasia.
These population trees with embedded gene trees show how mutations can generate nucleotide site patterns. The four branch tips of each gene tree represent genetic samples from four populations: modern Africans, modern Eurasians, Neanderthals, and Denisovans. In the left tree, the mutation (shown in blue) is shared by the Eurasian, Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes. In the right tree, the mutation (shown in red) is shared by the Eurasian and Neanderthal genomes.

A different evolutionary story
With only limited samples of fossil fragments, anthropologists assemble the history of human evolution using genetics and statistics.
Previous estimates of the Neanderthal population size are very small — around 1,000 individuals. However, a 2015 study showed that these estimates underrepresent the number of individuals if the Neanderthal population was subdivided into isolated, regional groups. The Utah team suggests that this explains the discrepancy between previous estimates and their own much larger estimate of Neanderthal population size.
“Looking at the data that shows how related everything was, the model was not predicting the gene patterns that we were seeing,” said Ryan Bohlender, post-doctoral fellow at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, and co-author of the study. “We needed a different model and, therefore, a different evolutionary story.”
The team developed an improved statistical method, called legofit, that accounts for multiple populations in the gene pool. They estimated the percentage of Neanderthal genes flowing into modern Eurasian populations, the date at which archaic populations diverged from each other, and their population sizes.
The human genome has about 3.5 billion nucleotide sites. Over time, genes at certain sites can mutate. If a parent passes down that mutation to their kids, who pass it to their kids, and so on, that mutation acts as a family seal stamped onto the DNA.
Scientists use these mutations to piece together evolutionary history hundreds of thousands of years in the past. By searching for shared gene mutations along the nucleotide sites of various human populations, scientists can estimate when groups diverged, and the sizes of populations contributing to the gene pool.
“You’re trying to find a fingerprint of these ancient humans in other populations. It’s a small percentage of the genome, but it’s there,” said Rogers.
They compared the genomes of four human populations: Modern Eurasians, modern Africans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. The modern samples came from Phase I of the 1000-Genomes project and the archaic samples came from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. The Utah team analyzed a few million nucleotide sites that shared a gene mutation in two or three human groups, and established 10 distinct nucleotide site patterns.
The new method confirmed previous estimates that modern Eurasians share about 2 percent of Neanderthal DNA. However, other findings questioned established theories.
Their analysis revealed that 20 percent of nucleotide sites exhibited a mutation only shared by Neanderthals and Denisovans, a genetic timestamp marking the time before the archaic groups diverged. The team calculated that Neanderthals and Denisovans separated about 744,000 years ago, much earlier than any other estimation of the split.
“If Neanderthals and Denisovans had separated later, then there ought to be more sites at which the mutation is present in the two archaic samples, but is absent from modern samples,” said Rogers.
The analysis also questioned whether the Neanderthal population had only 1,000 individuals. There is some evidence for this; Neanderthal DNA contains mutations that usually occur in small populations with little genetic diversity.
However, Neanderthal remains found in various locations are genetically different from each other. This supports the study’s finding that regional Neanderthals were likely small bands of individuals, which explains the harmful mutations, while the global population was quite large.
“The idea is that there are these small, geographically isolated populations, like islands, that sometimes interact, but it’s a pain to move from island to island. So, they tend to stay with their own populations,” said Bohlender.
Their analysis revealed that the Neanderthals grew to tens of thousands of individuals living in fragmented, isolated populations.
“There’s a rich Neanderthal fossil record. There are lots of Neanderthal sites,” said Rogers. “It’s hard to imagine that there would be so many of them if there were only 1,000 individuals in the whole world.”
Rogers is excited to apply the new method in other contexts.
“To some degree, this is a proof of concept that the method can work. That’s exciting,” said Rogers. “We have remarkable ability to estimate things with high precision, much farther back in the past than anyone has realized.”",1
"On February 19, 1942 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066: a controversial decree that resulted in the confinement of 120,000 civilians of Japanese descent.

"Rick Vaughn never did get a championship ring with the Cleveland Indians, but Charlie Sheen found another way to procure one.
The famed actor was revealed to be the owner of Babe Ruth’s 1927 World Series ring, along with an original copy of the sale document sending the Great Bambino to New York, and is selling both as part of a Leland’s auction that will be completed Friday.
The two lots are already drawing over $1 million combined, with bidding on the ring over $600,000 and bidding on the document over $400,000. Both are expected to climb higher, giving Sheen a handsome profit, or at least he thinks so — he has no memory of what he paid for them back in the early 1990s.
This is in large part due to their mint condition, which the “Major League” actor says is better than the condition of memorabilia seen at the Baseball Hall of Fame. Boston owner Harry Frazee’s copy of the document (Sheen is selling Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert’s) sold in 2005 for $996,000.
“I’ve enjoyed these incredible items for more than two decades and the time has come. Whatever price it brings is gravy,” Sheen told ESPN.
Sheen certainly has a taste for baseball memorabilia, having displayed these two items prominently in his home and having previously owned the ball that went through Bill Buckner’s legs in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series.

"Most U. K. health facilities whose computer systems were crippled in a global cyber-attack are back to normal operation,Home Secretary Amber Rudd said, even as experts warned that hackers would probably launch a new round of attacks with many computers still vulnerable.
About 97 percent of facilities and doctors affected are able to work normally, Rudd said Saturday after a U. K. government meeting. At the height of the attack Friday and early Saturday, 48 organizations in the National Health Service were affected, and hospitals in London, North West England and Central England urged people with non-emergency conditions to stay away as technicians tried to stop the spread of the malicious software.
“There will be lessons to learn from what appears to be the biggest criminal cyber-attack in history,” Rudd said in response to a letter from Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow secretary of state for health.
The malware, using a technique purportedly stolen from the U. S. National Security Agency, also affected Russia’s Ministry of Interior, Germany’s Deutsche Bahn rail system, automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA, logistics giant FedEx Corp., and other company and hospital computer systems in countries from Eastern Europe to the U.S. and Asia.More than 75,000 computers in 99 countries were compromised, with a heavy concentration of infections in Russia and Ukraine, according to Dutch security company Avast Software BV.
The hackers used the tool to encrypt files within affected computers, making them inaccessible, and demanded ransom -- typically $300 in bitcoin.
The initial attack was stifled when a security researcher disabled a key mechanism used by the worm to spread, but experts said the hackers were likely to mount a second attack because so many users of personal computers with Microsoft Corp. operating systems couldn’t or didn’t download a security patch released in March that Microsoft had labeled “critical.”
Microsoft said in a blog post Saturday that it was taking the “highly unusual“ step of providing the patch for older versions of Windows it was otherwise no longer supporting, including Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
The Good Guys Can Have the Upper Hand on Cybersecurity
Victims have paid about $30,000 in ransom so far, with the total expected to rise substantially next week, said Tom Robinson, chief operating officer and co-founder of Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a ransomware consultant that works with banks and companies in the U. K., U.S. and Europe. Robinson, in an interview by email, said he calculated the total based on payments tracked to Bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands.
Last year an acute-care hospital in Hollywood paid $17,000 in bitcoin to an extortionist who hijacked its computer systems and forced doctors and staff to revert to pen and paper for record-keeping.
Hospitals are also fertile ground for identity thieves because of their often-lax security policies. Bloomberg Businessweek wrote in 2015 about a spate of malware infections at hospitals where radiological machines, blood-gas analyzers and other devices were compromised and used to siphon off the personal data of patients.
A spokesman forSpain’s Telefonica SA said the hack affected some employees at its headquarters, but the phone company is attacked frequently and the impact of Friday’s incident wasn’t major. FedEx said it was “experiencing interference,” the Associated Press reported.
Renault halted production at some factories to stop the virus from spreading, a spokesman said Saturday, while Nissan’s U. K. car plant in Sunderland, in northeast England, was affected without causing any major impact on business, an official said.
In Germany, Deutsche Bahn faced “technical disruptions” on electronic displays at train stations, but travel was unaffected, the company said in a statement on its website. Newspaper reports showed images of a ransomware message on display screens blocking train information.
Russia’s Interior Ministry, with oversight of the police forces, said about “1,000 computers were infected,” which it described as less than 1 percent of the total, according to its website.
While any sized company could be vulnerable, many large organizations with robust security departments would have prioritized the update that Microsoft released in March and wouldn’t be vulnerable to Friday’s attack.
Ransomware is a particularly stubborn problem because victims are often tricked into allowing the malicious software to run on their computers, and the encryption happens too fast for security software to catch it. Some security expects calculate that ransomware may bring in as much as $1 billion a year in revenue for the attackers.
The attack was apparently halted in the afternoon in the U. K. when a researcher took control of an Internet domain that acted as a kill switch for the worm’s propagation, according to Ars Technica.
“I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after I registered it, so initially it was accidental,” wrote the researcher, who uses the Twitter name @MalwareTechBlog. “So long as the domain isn’t revoked, this particular strain will no longer cause harm, but patch your systems ASAP as they will try again.”
There is a high-probability that Russian-language cybercriminals were behind the attack, said Aleks Gostev, chief cybersecurity expert for Kaspersky Labs.
“Ransomware is traditionally their topic,” he said. “The geography of attacks that hit post-Soviet Union most also suggests that.”

"An article from RT.com: “Facebook has been given four weeks to respond to a class action, launched against it by an Austrian activist and supported by 60,000 users. The suit claims Facebook violated users’ privacy, by cooperating with the NSA’s PRISM program.
The class action initiated by Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer, data privacy activist and founder of Europe vs. Facebook group has passed its first review in the Vienna Regional Court. Facebook Ireland, which runs the social network’s activities outside the US and Canada, has been given four weeks to respond to the action. “The order is very likely on the way to Facebook. The first step in the legal procedure is hereby taken,” said a statement by Europe vs. Facebook on Thursday
The group has described the suit, joined by 25,000 users, as “the largest privacy class action in Europe” and specified that 35,000 more users have registered on www.fbclaim.com, expressing their will to join the action should it expand.
Facebook Ireland will have an opportunity to ask the court to extend the time frame for its reply to eight weeks. If the counter-statement from the social network never arrives, then the court will be able to make a judgment in its absence. Schrems filed the class action at the beginning of August. He claims Facebook practices are in violation of the European data protection law.
“For this lawsuit we have chosen basic or obvious violations of the law: The privacy policy, participation in the PRISM program, Facebook’s graph search, apps on Facebook, tracking on other web pages (e.g. via the ‘like buttons’), ‘big data’ systems that spy on users or the non-compliance with access requests,” Schrems earlier wrote on the Facebook Class Action website.
The activist and the main plaintiff in the suit wants Facebook, which has 1.32 billion active users and is worth around $195 billion, to pay out 500 to each supporter of the class action, in case his allegations are supported in court. Compensation is not the Schrems’ ultimate goal: that is to force Facebook to change its policies to ensure users’ personal data is protected. Facebook Ireland has not yet commented on the legal action.
It’s not Schrem’s first attempt to challenge US web giants for alleged violations of private data. His Europe vs. Facebook challenged the Irish Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) a year ago by demanding it to probe into the activities of US companies, including Facebook, to assess their involvement in the NSA spy scandal. The watchdog rejected the appeal. The group then took its legal battle to the Irish High Court, which referred the case to the European Court of Justice in July.”",1
"An online petition that currently has43,971 signatures, is asking the UK Parliament to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes when he visits London next month.
Israel have dismissed the petition as a ‘publicity stunt’, saying“This is a public relations stunt that has no practical significance”.
However, if the petition reaches 100,000 signatures, MPs will be obliged to discuss the matter in Parliament.
Benjamin Netanyahu is to hold talks in London this September. Under international law he should be arrested for war crimes upon arrival in the U. K for the massacre of over 2000 civilians in 2014
The petition was created through the British Parliament E-petitions website. If a petition garners 100,000 signatures, the issue will be considered for a debate in Parliament, but there is no guarantee it must be debated. As of Tuesday evening, the petition had more than 35,000 signatures, but Israel believes the Cameron government will not allow a debate of this issue.
The petition’s author, a British national who goes by the name of Damian Moran, wrote that Netanyahu is to hold talks in London this September, and “under international law he should be arrested for war crimes upon arrival in the UK for the massacre of over 2,000 civilians in 2014.”
Since Netanyahu is a sitting prime minister with diplomatic immunity, there is no chance he will be arrested under universal jurisdiction laws. Nonetheless, Israelis have been apprehensive over the prospect that former army officers and defense chiefs could be arrested overseas.
Earlier this year, Israeli diplomats scrambled to secure immunity for former IDF chief of staff and defense minister Shaul Mofaz just prior to his trip to London for a defense conference. Israeli media reported that Mofaz was at risk of being detained on possible war crimes charges since Israeli authorities had tried and failed to secure diplomatic immunity for him on his trip.
Four years ago, the British government approved a change to the controversial universal jurisdiction law, which has been used by anti-Israel activists to obtain arrest warrants for alleged war crimes against Israeli dignitaries visiting the UK.
The law previously allowed private complaints of war crimes to be lodged against military personnel even if they were not British citizens and the alleged crimes were committed elsewhere.
High-profile targets in recent years have included former foreign minister Tzipi Livni and former defense minister Ehud Barak.",1
"One-hundred-eleven years and a few months ago, Theodore Roosevelt signed the landmark law that helped cement his place as America’s conservation president.
The Antiquities Act is brief – just two sentences allow a president to set aside for federal protection “objects of historic or scientific interest”.
It’s been used dozens of times by 16 presidents from both parties to preserve some of America’s most beloved wild lands and historic landmarks, laying the foundations for national parks and generations of family adventures. Many national parks – including South Dakota’s Badlands, Alaska’s Kenai Fjords and Death Valley in California and Nevada – began as national monuments.
Those lands are now facing a two-headed assault from Congress and the Trump administration, and the act itself faces an uncertain future.
Within a few months of signing the Antiquities Act, Roosevelt chose the country’s first national monument – a hulking 1,267ft-tall butte that towers above the forests of eastern Wyoming. In his proclamation on 24 September 1906, Roosevelt called Devil’s Tower “such an extraordinary example of the effect of erosion in the higher mountains as to be a natural wonder”.
Jeff Muratore, an avid outdoorsman from Casper, Wyoming, hunts in the shadow of Devil’s Tower.
“Growing up in Wyoming and hunting the Black Hills, it’s familiar from many of the mountains around,” he says. “I think it’s important that it’s been protected because of how unique it is. There’s nothing like it in the world. Protecting it was crucial.”
If a bill quietly working its way through the House of Representatives right now were law 111 years ago, Devil’s Tower wouldn’t have qualified as a national monument. Neither would the Grand Canyon, which Roosevelt protected as a monument in 1908 before it was made a national park. Nor would the Petrified Forest national park, Utah’s Zion national park, Bryce Canyon or many of America’s other legendary protected lands.
For Greg Munther, a retired forest ranger and biologist in Missoula, Montana, the national landmark closest to his heart is a the Upper Missouri River Breaks, a nearly 500,000-acre stretch of wild and scenic river in north-central Montana.
Munther first visited the spot about 40 years ago and was awestruck. “It was just mind-blowing,” he said.
“You don’t see intrusions, you don’t see modern life. When you are in there and you think about the history, and it’s still intact. It’s just like it was when Lewis and Clark took their boats up.”
The Upper Missouri River Breaks wouldn’t qualify as a monument under the bill, sponsored by Republican Rob Bishop of Utah. Like many monuments, it’s too big. The measure would cap the size of monuments and, critically, remove the ability to protect monuments of scientific interest,  ruling out places selected for their unique formations like the giant sequoia trees of California and Wyoming’s Fossil Butte.
In an op-ed in the Washington Examiner, Bishop called the Antiquities Act, “a menace to constitutional government”. Bishop targeted Barack Obama’s use of the act to protect 553.6m acres in two dozen monuments across the country. “Actions such as these are not the rule of law,” he said. “It is arbitrary rule by one man.”
Bishop’s bill, which has drawn united opposition from sporting and recreation groups across the country, could give legal authority to the Trump administration to shrink monuments. The interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, this summer recommended reducing the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah, and Oregon’s Cascade-Siskiyou monument, but he hasn’t made his review public.
Public lands supporters across the American west see it as hand-in-glove with the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink public lands and protections. For many, the attack is personal.
“You look at places like the Upper Missouri Breaks here in Montana or the Organ Mountain Desert Peaks in New Mexico, these monuments are places for us to go experience the solitude and challenge that really only our public lands allow us,” said Land Tawney, president of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, a national conservation group based in Montana. “Our connections are deep and pretty strong. These are not places you put on a shelf.”
Bishop’s office did not respond to requests for comment on the measure, which last week passed the House natural resources committee without public hearing.
For a sense of the depth of America’s love affair with its national monuments, take a stroll through the nearly three million comments submitted to the interior department on Zinke’s still officially private review of the scope of national monuments.
The vast majority – one appraisal says 96% – favor keeping current monuments for future generations. Zinke has dismissed the flood of comments, saying they were part of a “well-orchestrated national campaign”. And yes, many are repetitive; many are personal.
“I grew up in Arizona, traveling to national monuments with my family on vacation in a pop-up trailer. Camping around the country to go visit national monuments was a highlight of my childhood and one I would like my future children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren to experience.”
Others go straight to the point:
“Please do not reduce our public monuments. They are more important than most people understand. They should be expanded, not reduced.”
“I want public lands preserved so my daughter and her children can enjoy the natural beauties of America as I was able to do growing up.”
Zinke’s monument review reportedly includes a surprising expansion – a recommendation for a new monument in his home state of Montana, protecting the Badger Two Medicine, a wilderness sacred to the Blackfeet Indian Tribe.
But there’s a catch, even for the swaggering interior secretary who styles himself as a modern-day Theodore Roosevelt.
At nearly 130,000 acres, his favored wilderness is too big, and too wild, to qualify as a monument under Bishop’s bill.",0

Mohammed Shoaib, 7, who was shot on his chest before crossing the border fromBurma in August, shows his injury outside a medical center after seeing a doctor at Kutupalong refugee camp near Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, on Nov. 5, (Adnan Abidi/Reuters)   COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh— They may be out of harm’s way, for now, but their ordeal continues. Over the past two months, more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees have crossed the border from Burma, also known asMyanmar, to seek shelter in Bangladesh. Not since the Rwandan genocide has a humanitarian crisis unfolded so fast and on such a scale. If one counts the hundreds of thousands who were already based here, driven out by earlier waves of violence in Rakhine state, there are now more than a million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. At first, the new arrivals were welcomed. Across Bangladesh, there is an outpouring of sympathy for the persecuted minority who have been driven from their homes by a harrowing campaign of torture, rape, killings, arson and other human rights violations. The Bangladeshi government, which had long been ambivalent towards the Rohingya, embraced them. On a visit to the camps last month, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared that if Bangladesh could feed 160 million people, it could feed hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees. Across the Cox’s Bazar district, she is shown consoling refugee children on placards that hail her as the “Mother of Humanity.” Now, the mood is slowly giving way to anxiety. Bangladeshis are keenly aware that the humanitarian crisis has enhanced their prestige abroad, but there are worries about how their poor, densely populated country will cope. With an eye on next year’s elections, which are clouded by fears about how the religious right might exploit the crisis, ministers routinely grumble about the insupportable burden they are forced to carry. There is no sign that the refugees will be able to return to their homes anytime soon, and there is no plan to provide for their long-term needs. As far as Burma’s generals see it, they have successfully executed a plan to finally rid themselves of the Rohingya. Stripped of their citizenship, denied recognition as an ethnic group, the Rohingya have long been subject to an entrenched system of discrimination. The heart-rending testimonies of the past two months bear a chilling consistency with reports from the late 1970s, when 200,000 Rohingya were also driven out of their villages amid a frenzy of violence. Back then, many Bangladeshis found it easy to sympathize with the plight of the Rohingya. The memories of 1971, when the Pakistan army carried out large-scale human rights violations and drove millions of refugees into India, were still fresh. But that didn’t stop the government from trying to force them back. “We are not going to make the refugees so comfortable that they won’t go back to Burma,” a minister said at the time. Within the space of six months, 10,000 refugees had died in the camps of hunger. The desire to see the refugees return to Burma appears to dominate the current Bangladeshi government’s thinking. It has refused to grant the Rohingya refugee status, leaving them without any legal status on either side of the border. That decision may seem trivial, but it’s of fateful significance, since it prevents international humanitarian aid agencies from mobilizing the kind of support needed. Also against the wishes of the humanitarian community, the government is constructing what may become the world’s largest refugee camp. The Kutupalong refugee camp, assigned to Rohingya refugees who fled here during the early 1990s, has now been extended in every direction. Scattered across 3,000 acres of previously forested land, it will become home to more than a million people. Plans are underway to coax earlier arrivals of Rohingya refugees out of the makeshift dwellings and onto the rambling hills where they have been assigned shelter. There is no direct access by road; supplies have to be delivered by foot. The weather is oppressive. The searing heat is only interrupted by monsoon rain or severe gusts of wind. The thought of the camp’s fate during the coming cyclone season fills the humanitarian community with dread, as do other looming hazards. A fire in a tent, or the outbreak of disease, will sweep across the camp with a fury that will be difficult to tame.Doctors Without Borders has described health conditions in the camp as a “time bomb.” The government is still toying with the reckless idea of moving the Rohingya refugees offshore, to a pair of uninhabited and uninhabitable silt islands that have barely emerged into view. Meanwhile, criminal gangs, human traffickers, armed groups and others who sense opportunity in misery are a constant menace. Every refugee I spoke to said they wanted to go home— but not before “shanti,” or peace, returns. It will not be enough for the violence to stop. The cruel, entrenched system of discrimination and segregation that made them so vulnerable in the first place has to be dismantled. The Rohingya cannot be left living in fear of a fresh wave of violence that will drive them across the border yet again, condemned to their tragic status as a perpetually unwanted people. For that to happen, Burma’s military must be held accountable and Bangladesh’s government must be helped with its burden. This is not a crisis that will disappear any time soon, and unless there is a determined global response over the long-term, it could become worse still. The plight of the Rohingya is a test — a moment that demands the international community demonstrate that the words “never again” still carry some meaning.",0
"Terrell Owens did not get voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday, with the former wide receiver calling the selection process flawed in a pair of tweets posted before the official announcement was made.
Owens did not elaborate on why he thought the process is flawed.
The 43-year-old was in his second year as one of 15 finalists.
He has been a controversial candidate, having played for five teams over 15 seasons on the way to 15,934 receiving yards (second-most all time) and 153 receiving touchdowns (third-most all time).
The seven-person Hall of Fame Class of 2017 was announced Saturday night. The five modern-era players to make it were LaDainian Tomlinson, Kurt Warner, Jason Taylor, Terrell Davis and Morten Andersen.
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones made the Hall as a contributor, and former Seattle Seahawks safety Kenny Easley was voted in as a seniors committee candidate.
The class will be enshrined Aug. 5 in Canton, Ohio.
A panel of 46 media members and two current Hall of Famers, James Lofton and Dan Fouts, trimmed the list of finalists to 10 and then five Saturday. Owens reportedly did not make the final 10. The last five, meanwhile, were then voted in on a yes-or-no basis.
Owens had 60 or more catches in all but three seasons. The five-time All-Pro and six-time Pro Bowler had nine 1,000-yard seasons over an 11-year span and eight seasons with double-digit touchdown receptions.
He also led the NFL in touchdown catches three times (16 in 2001, 13 in ’02, 13 in ’06).
Owens continued to rant against the Hall on Twitter later Saturday night, saying: “HOF is a total joke. Honestly, doesn’t mean anything to me to get in beyond this point.”
He did, however, congratulate the 2017 class.",1
"It looks like while Obama was president, he andhis family have spent a staggering amount on vacations reaching higher than $85 million.
Even though millions of Americans were struggling just to put food on the table, the Obamas spent our money to enjoy their lavishvacations!
But that’s not all they also enforced laws that almost destroyed our country by using our taxpayer’s money for some silly stuff!
This is whyPresident Trump is keeping his promise to get rid of wasteful spending and corruption at agencies like the EPA.
The Environmental Protection Agency has ended a nearly $1 million program that provided gym memberships for employees.
The new administration under EPA administrator Scott Pruitt identified the gym memberships as an abuse of taxpayer dollars. Examples of the program’s misuse included $15,000 for gym memberships for 37 EPA scientists in Las Vegas last year.
We have ended taxpayer-funded fitness centers at EPA; a program that was costing American taxpayers $900,000 per year,” said EPA spokesperson Jahan Wilcox. “Disinvestment in using federal funds for EPA fitness centers will allow the agency to invest this money in core activities to protect the environment.”
Pruitt vowed an end to taxpayer-funded programs after the Washington Free Beacon report on the agency spending $15,000 on gym memberships in Las Vegas, earlier this year. Employees in the U. S. Environmental Science Division billed taxpayers $399 each for gym memberships, even though employees had access to a “state-of-the-art” gym on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) campus.
The campus gym includes a relaxation room with massage chairs, fitness assessments, personal trainers for hire, a registered dietician, a spa and leisure pool, indoor jogging, and a “gender neutral bathroom.”
The EPA began notifying employee unions last week that the agency is discontinuing fitness subsidies and fitness center funding, according to an EPA official.
The benefits will officially end on July 31, and no additional funds for fitness centers will be provided. For facilities that already have gym equipment that is paid for, the EPA will no longer pay for the maintenance of the equipment and will not purchase any new equipment.
The Trump administration has proposed cutting the EPA budget by 31 percent.

"The famousLeonid meteor showeris predicted to reach its peak in the predawn hours on Friday, Nov. 17. Weather permitting, observing conditions will be perfect: There's a new moon on Saturday, which means that the sky will be dark with no hindrance whatsoever from moonlight.
But don't expect to see a lot of meteors. In fact, a single observer will likely see no more than 10 to 15 of these meteors per hour emanating from the ""sickle"" ofLeo, the lion.
Hence the moniker for these meteors: the ""Leonids."" The sickle — a star pattern that looks like a backward question mark and outlines the ""mane"" of Leo the lion — rises above the east-northeast horizon around 11 p.m. local time. By about 5 a.m. local time, this eye-catching star pattern will have ascended to a position high in the south-southeast part of the sky. [Most Amazing Leonid Meteor Shower Photos]
The Leonid meteor shower is an extremely variable event that happens every year when Earth's orbit crosses a trail of comet crumbs left behind by Comet Tempel-Tuttle. A dense swarm of Leonid meteors returns to Earth about every 33 years, or about the time it takes for Tempel-Tuttle to orbit the sun.
Accompanying the return of its parent comet, the Leonid meteor shower arrives asa storm of meteorsevery 33 years, producing more than 1,000 ""shooting stars"" per hour. (During the strongest outbursts in 1799, 1833, 1866 and 1966, spectacular displays exceeded 1,000 meteors per minute!)
During the most recent Leonid cycle, however, meteor rates were much lower. Between 1998 and 2002, meteors fell at the rate of many hundreds to several thousand per hour.
In 2014, the swarm of Leonid meteors was at aphelion — the point in its orbit farthest away from the sun — out nearthe orbit of Uranus. That's the main reason the Leonids have been weak in recent years. But they are always somewhat unpredictable.
Earth meets these meteors head-on because they are traveling through space in a direction opposite to that of our home planet. As a result, they streak through our sky at ultraswift speeds of up to 45 miles per second (72 kilometers per second). About half of them leave visible trains that, in the most extreme cases, can persist for many seconds.
An unfortunate circumstance will befall the Leonids in the year 2028. On its way in toward the sun, the swarm will pass near Jupiter, and the big planet's powerful gravity will deflect the thickly clustered trails of meteoroids away from Earth's orbit. As such, potential major Leonid displays in 2031, 2032 and 2033 either will be considerably reduced in intensity or might not materialize at all. [How Meteor Showers Work (Infographic)]
However, Jupiter apparently will have little or no influence on the Leonid swarm in 2034, and most meteor experts believe that as many as 500 to 1,000 meteors will appear per hour. That's a far cry from the stupendous storms that occurred in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, yet there will still be a plentiful number for those gazing skyward 17 years from now.
But in the interim, check out the Leonids this weekend. If you're going out to watch for meteors, try to find dark skies away from light pollution, and remember to bundle up — it can get chilly at night this time of year even in warmer climates! Good luck!

"The Ebola virus, known to lurk in semen for months after recovery, also can stay in the eye for weeks, researchers reported Thursday.
The good news is that it doesn’t seem to be in the tears or tissues that could infect others. The bad news is that it can damage vision, the team reports in the New England Journal of Medicine.
“This case highlights an important complication of Ebola virus disease with major implications for both individual and public health that are immediately relevant to the ongoing West African outbreak,” Dr. Jay Varkey of Emory University Hospital and colleagues write in their report, which was also presented to a medical meeting in Denver.
The patient was Dr. Ian Crozier, who was infected while helping fight Ebola in Sierra Leone and who spent six weeks recovering at Emory. Crozier, 43, was extremely ill – he had multiple organ failure, he spent 12 days on a ventilator and had to undergo more than three weeks of dialysis.
Even as he recovered, he had trouble thinking and walking. “On day 44 of the illness, hemodialysis was no longer required and his mental status had markedly improved, with some residual mild word-finding difficulty,” Varkey’s team wrote.
Crozier, who only revealed his identity weeks after his recovery, thought he was in the clear. Then his eye started getting red and sore.
He came back to Emory and they treated him for an eye infection. When steroids didn’t help, they carefully took some fluid from inside the eyeball – mindful that it just might contain some virus – and sent it for testing.
Sure enough, the Ebola virus as deep inside Crozier’s eye, affecting his vision and causing pain. His vision deteriorated from perfect to 20/400.
The infection eventually resolved with more treatment, but the case is one more illustration that Ebola can leave even its lucky few survivors with long-lasting souvenirs. Other patients say they have joint pain even months after recovery, and there had been some hints that eye trouble and even blindness might plague survivors as well.
“It is reassuring that samples of conjunctivae and tears tested negative for Ebola virus.""
In the most troubling case, the last known Ebola patient in Liberia died in March and the only possible known way she could have gotten it seems to have been through sex with her fiancé, an Ebola survivor.
There does not seem to be a way to spread the virus from an infected eye, however, says Varkey.
“It is reassuring that samples of conjunctivae and tears tested negative for Ebola virus, a finding that supports previous studies suggesting that patients who recover from Ebola virus disease pose no risk of spreading the infection through casual contact,” they wrote.
Ebola’s infected more than 26,000 people in the ongoing West African epidemic and killed 11,000 of them.",0
"e recently posed for a GQ magazine photo shoot with a fly fishing rod in front of snow-capped Montana peaks.
He rode a horse – named Tonto – down the National Mall to his first day of work at the Interior Department.
And earlier this month, he donned a National Park Service uniform to greet park-goers at the entrance of the Grand Canyon.
Montana-born interior secretary Ryan Zinke – who meets with President Trump on Friday morning – meticulously crafts his image as wilderness-loving western cowboy and sportsman. But nine months into his job at the Department of the Interior, the federal agency that oversees most public lands and natural resources, the act is wearing thin with environmentalists and outdoors enthusiasts who say his early moves demonstrate strong allegiance to the oil, gas and other extractive industries seeking access to some of America’s most spectacular protected landscapes.
He has reversed an Obama-era ban on coal mining on public lands, and proposed changes that would shrink the borders of four national monuments set aside by previous presidents. His agency has taken early steps to open the door to oil exploration in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge – one of the most symbolic and fiercely protected sites of the American environmental movement. He’s announced plans to repeal an important fracking safety rule, and loosened safety guidelines for underwater drilling, both major shifts away from Obama-era environmental protection regulations.
Earlier this week, his agency set off a new firestorm of criticism by announcing that entrance fees for some of America’s most popular national parks will increase substantially next year.
“To make it cheaper for coal companies to strip mine in watersheds and make it more expensive for families to visit Yosemite is a perversion of American values,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. “I think the secretary is a fraud.“
Meanwhile, Zinke is also coming under scrutiny for other reasons, including his use of private and military jets. According to Politico, the secretary spent more than $12,000 on a private jet to his home state of Montana, and took a private plane to the US Virgin Islands. Zinke, who declined to be interviewed for this story, called the travel controversy “a little BS” in a public appearance.
Most recently, lawmakers from both parties in the mainland US and Puerto Rico have called for an investigation into how a tiny energy company in Zinke’s hometown of Whitefish, Montana won a major contract to rebuild power lines in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. The interior department has denied that Zinke played a role in the contract award.
The interior department is in charge of the management and conservation of most federal lands and natural resources, and it includes important divisions such as the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. As such, the agency is often the arbiter between oil, gas and mining companies seeking access to valuable resources embedded in public lands, and environmentalists seeking to protect the same lands for biodiversity, wildlife and recreation.
Zinke has reshaped the department, filling top political posts with former executives and lobbyist for the extractive industries. Deputy interior secretary David Bernhardt, for example, is a former lobbyist for the oil and gas industry. According to a report by the Western Values Project, a progressive organization, at least 21 of Zinke’s political appointees have backgrounds tied to extractive industries.
“He sold himself as a Theodore Roosevelt Republican. That means wise use,” said Land Tawney, president of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, a national conservation group headquartered in Montana. “More and more sportsmen are waking up to what’s going on.”
Since he took over the department, Zinke has also resurrected an arcane military ritual, requiring staff to hoist the department flag above the building whenever he enters.
Zinke, the son of a plumber and a realtor, grew up in Whitefish, a ski town of 4,000 people in northwestern Montana. The6ft 4in secretary is a former high school and college football hero and a retired Navy Seal.
Zinke made his name politically as a moderate Republican in Montana’s legislature, and easily won his first run for Congress in 2014 by a margin of 15 points. He repeated that success two years later, despite questions about whether he actually lived in Montana and earlier suggestions that he failed to rise in the ranks of the Navy because of travel spending improprieties. Given his moderate politics in his home state, many are scratching their heads over his hardline turn.
Observers says he’s not ideologically driven like Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has set clear, focused sights on dismantling environmental regulations in the United States for the benefit of industry. At his confirmation hearing, Zinke said he was concerned about climate change, and he regularly declares his “love” for public lands.
Gloria Flora, a former US Forest Service manager in Montana and prominent conservationist, believes Zinke is fairly easy to explain in the context of political tribalism of the Trump era.
“He’s a Montanan. He’s on the Trump team. He’s doing Trump politics in every place but Montana,” she said. “When it’s not personal, then you revert to what your team has been saying and the values your team has.”
It is apparent Zinke wants to cultivate a folksy persona for the public, but he doesn’t want difficult interactions with that public. Earlier this month, when he put on a park worker’s uniform to greet park-goers at the entrance of the Grand Canyon, a visitor questioned him on his proposal for national monuments. Zinke shut the man down with a smile and no answers.
Whether the Trump administration succeeds in changing the shape of America’s public lands could depend on Zinke. For now, his early moves and those potential changes appear to have galvanized a thriving opposition, uncharmed by his cowboy style.",0

"Facebook accounts with apparent Russian ties purchased about $150,000 in political ads aimed at American voters during key periods of the 2016 presidential campaign, according to a new analysis released Wednesday by the social networking company.
The internal Facebook findings – which it said in a blog post it had already turned over to U. S. authorities – comes as the Silicon Valley giant faces intense scrutiny from special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees concerned about how both real internet trolls and fake news bots preyed on U.S. voters during last year’s election.
Facebook found some $100,000 in ad spending from June 2015 through May 2017 connected to about 470 accounts that were deemed as inauthentic and in violation of its internal guidelines. These accounts – associated with about 3,000 ads – were connected to each other “and likely operated out of Russia,” Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, wrote in a Wednesday blog post.
While the “vast majority” of those ads didn’t reference any specific presidential candidate, or even the election itself, Stamos explained that the Russian ads that Facebook uncovered were designed to amplify hot-button social and political issues, such as LGBT rights, race, immigration and gun rights.
A quarter of the Russian-linked ads were also geographically targeted at specific Facebook audiences in the U. S., and most of them ran in 2015 before the first primaries and caucuses when the GOP and Democratic presidential fields were still packed with multiple candidates. While the amount of spending on the ads was nominal at best, the fact that it even occurred is likely to reinforce concerns expressed by some Democrats that Russia may have used Facebook to promote narratives that flattered Trump and bashed Clinton in key Rust Belt swing states that helped the real estate mogul take the White House.
“This is no longer supposition,” said Andrew Bleeker, the president of Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic digital advertising firm that worked for Clinton in 2016.
On Capitol Hill, California Rep. Adam Schiff – the top Democrat in the House’s Russia probe – reacted to the Facebook analysis to note he’s trying to get an Intelligence Committee hearing on “the use of social media by Russia during the campaign.” He said there’s been no agreement yet about which witnesses would be called.
Separately, Facebook also found another $50,000 in political ad spending – for about 2,200 ads – that were bought from accounts “that might have originated in Russia,” Stamos wrote.
Stamos explained that Facebook cast a wide net looking for accounts “with very weak signals of a connection and not associated with any known organized effort.” It also was looking for ads bought from accounts with U. S. internet protocol addresses but with the language setting dialed in to Russian.
The overall spending figure for the Russian-linked ads – at about $150,000 – is a relatively small amount compared to the overall digital ad buy made during the course of the 2016 campaign. While firm spending totals are difficult to assess because of loose federal election reporting requirements, media reports in the aftermath of last year’s presidential race have cited $55 million in spending from one of Hillary Clinton’s primary digital firms, and $90 million spent on Donald Trump’s side through his main digital adviser, Brad Parscale.
Facebook has been under the microscope for months to explain how its platform was exploited during the last presidential campaign. That race remains under investigation for potential collusion between Trump’s team and a Russian government that U. S. intelligence agencies stated earlier this year had a “clear preference” for the Republican.
In May, Oxford Internet Institute professor Philip Howard and colleague Robert Gorwa co-authored an op-ed in the Washington Post urging lawmakers to force Facebook’s hand and produce any underlying metadata about questionable social media accounts that may have played a role in the election outcome.
“If there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian influence operations, Facebook may be able to spot that too,” the researchers wrote. “In many ways, massive coordinated propaganda campaigns are just another form of election interference. If Facebook has data on this, it needs to share it.”
Facebook has undertaken its own internal review of how it tracked and handled activity on its site during the presidential election, including the spread of fake news. New policies include limits on news feeds that share stories with consistent clickbait headlines and blocks on pages that repeatedly share fake news stories to advertise. The company also removed 30,000 fake accounts before the French elections in April and tens of thousands of accounts before the United Kingdom’s snap election in June.",0
"Robert Vondracek has had multiple sclerosis for 20 years. His speech is starting to slur and he’s been having more trouble getting around, and when he heard about a controversial stem cell therapy that might help, he got excited.
“I heard about the stem cell treatments being done right here in Phoenix,” said Vondracek, 61. “It shocked me because it was not approved in this country, I didn’t think.”
The therapy was offered by an Arizona plastic surgeon who gives the stem cell treatments in the same clinic where he does cosmetic procedures.
But when Vondracek’s neurologist heard about his interest in the therapy, which would cost $7,000 per treatment, “He went crazy,” said Vondracek. He strongly advised Vondracek against it.
Plastic surgeons, other doctors and naturopaths at more than 100 clinics round the country are charging thousands of dollars for a controversial procedure called stem cell therapy to treat a range of disorders, including neurological diseases like MS and Parkinson’s.
The procedure has angered many neurologists and prominent researchers who say these doctors are preying on vulnerable people and capitalizing on the huge but still unrealized potential of stem cell research, which they say is years away from producing an approved treatment for neurological diseases.
“Peddling snake oil in the guise of stem cell therapies is really a threat to legitimate research,” said Dr. George Daley, director of the Stem Cell Transplantation Program at Boston Children's Hospital, past president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research and a professor at Harvard Medical School.
“Finding cures is hard, it takes sometimes decades, it's extremely expensive and it's not something that we can just wish and hope for,” he said. “It can only be achieved through very, very hard work.”
The stem cell therapy usually involves using liposuction to extract a patient's fat before separating out the stem cells using a centrifuge. The stem cells are then injected into the patient's blood stream the same day intravenously. Prices for this and similar treatments range from $6,000 to $20,000 per session.
The treatments have been popular in Europe and Asia for years, but until recently were unavailable in this country. But in the past few years, stem cell therapy clinics have cropped up in the U. S., and their numbers are increasing due to the franchise-like expansion of groups like the California-based Cell Surgical Network.
“We are growing,” said Dr. Mark Berman, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who was one of the Cell Surgical Network’s founders. He said he trained two doctors to perform the procedure just this week.
Dr. Steven Gitt , the Phoenix plastic surgeon whose services Robert Vondracek ultimately decided not to use, is also a member of the Cell Surgical Network. Gitt says he makes certain to tell his patients the procedure is not a cure and informs them they are participating in a study.
“We're doing it ethically and honestly. We are gathering good data and we are contributing and we are helping,” said Gitt in a recent interview with NBC News. He stressed that the procedure is safe and he knows of no patient who has been injured by it.
Gitt said that 60 to 80 percent of the people who receive the treatment have a positive outcome, meaning their quality of life is improved. When asked for neurological patients who had a positive outcome to interview, he suggested NBC News speak with Libby Aira, whose 41-year-old daughter Darian was hit by a car and suffered a traumatic brain injury eight years ago. Darian is unable to communicate.
“We did the stem cells and just a few hours later she reached for a glass of water on the right side, her affected side,” said Libby. “She couldn’t grasp or hold it, but just that intention of reaching for it was something we hadn’t seen.”
“Since then we’ve seen very slow little things. No big major steps -- I want her walking -- but now I see that happening [in the future],” said Libby.
But the neurologist who dissuaded Robert Vondracek from receiving stem cell treatment accused doctors who offer the treatments with “lining their pockets.”
“The only people who are benefitting are the clinics,” said Dr. Virgil DiBiase. He said that dozens of patients have called him about the treatments, which they find advertised on-line, and that the costs they cited sometimes topped $15,000. “Legitimate treatments are not marketed through YouTube or slick websites.”
Dr. Daley, director of the stem cell program in Boston, said it was “dramatically premature” to charge patients “for a therapy we don’t yet know is safe or effective.""
“I’m concerned that this this may actually be the pedaling of unproven treatments but masquerading as research,” said Daley.
“Our ability to know whether any of these interventions would work in actual MS patients is going to require rigorous clinical trials and a lot more hard work,” he said.
Dr. Gitt said he is performing the procedure to help his patients, and that he makes 90 percent or more of his income from his plastic surgery practice.
“What really excited and has continued to excite me about this field is that I kind of feel a little bit more like an old time real doc in that I’m really making amazing changes for people,” said Gitt.
Gitt said that he and other doctors using the technique are conducting a pilot study “to identify those conditions which will merit more vigorous prospective double-blind randomized type studies and go from there.” He said pharmaceutical companies and universities are not funding the procedure and that is why patients have to fund the study themselves.
Berman said the research scientists who are critical of the procedure are missing the forest for the trees.
“We are finding out stuff those guys will never find out because they’re stuck in the lab,” said Dr. Berman, who provided a handful of stories of people who have dramatically improved after the treatment.
He also countered critics who challenge the ethics of using a treatment that has not been sanctioned by federal regulators, or charging patients to participate in a study.
“We’re not flying under the radar and I’m not apologizing to anyone,” he said. “We’re doing investigative work. We have a huge online database. And we’re learning as we go along.”
Berman said his patients all know they’re part of an “investigative study” and “everybody signs informed consent.” He plans to apply for something called an Investigational Device Exemption from the federal Food and Drug Administration.
Under FDA guidelines, the procedure used by Berman and Gitt is not regulated because the cells are “minimally manipulated,” aren’t combined with other genetic material and the patient gets only his or her cells re-injected.
According to the FDA, the value of stem cells for most new applications is largely unproven, which can mean that patients forego effective therapies and instead are treated with unproven stem cell therapies.
“The safety of stem cell therapies for a variety of uses has not been assessed,” said a spokesperson for the agency. “Even stem cells isolated from a person’s own tissue can present … risks when put into an area where they are not performing the same biological function that they were originally.”
The agency said it is committed to supporting the development of new products to address unmet medical needs, including new applications for stem cell-based products. “It is important to understand that while the FDA works to make lifesaving treatments available to patients quickly and efficiently,” said the spokesperson, “the FDA is committed to assuring both the safety and the efficacy of the products it approves for use in the United States.”
“The FDA is concerned that the hope that patients have for cures which are not yet available may leave them vulnerable to unscrupulous providers of stem cell treatments which have not been evaluated for safety and efficacy and could potentially be harmful.”",0
"NASA has discovered a new Earth-like planet circling Kepler-90, a Sun-like star 2,545 light years from Earth, using new AI technology.
The newly-discovered Kepler-90i was found using advanced machine learning from Google.
Spacedaily.com reports: Machine learning is an approach to artificial intelligence in which computers “learn.” In this case, computers learned to identify planets by finding in Kepler data instances where the telescope recorded signals from planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets.
“Just as we expected, there are exciting discoveries lurking in our archived Kepler data, waiting for the right tool or technology to unearth them,” said Paul Hertz, director of NASA’s Astrophysics Division in Washington. “This finding shows that our data will be a treasure trove available to innovative researchers for years to come.”
The discovery came about after researchers Christopher Shallue and Andrew Vanderburg trained a computer to learn how to identify exoplanets in the light readings recorded by Kepler – the miniscule change in brightness captured when a planet passed in front of, or transited, a star.
Inspired by the way neurons connect in the human brain, this artificial “neural network” sifted through Kepler data and found weak transit signals from a previously-missed eighth planet orbiting Kepler-90, in the constellation Draco.
While machine learning has previously been used in searches of the Kepler database, this research demonstrates that neural networks are a promising tool in finding some of the weakest signals of distant worlds.
Other planetary systems probably hold more promise for life than Kepler-90. About 30 percent larger than Earth, Kepler-90i is so close to its star that its average surface temperature is believed to exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, on par with Mercury. Its outermost planet, Kepler-90h, orbits at a similar distance to its star as Earth does to the Sun.
“The Kepler-90 star system is like a mini version of our solar system. You have small planets inside and big planets outside, but everything is scrunched in much closer,” said Vanderburg, a NASA Sagan Postdoctoral Fellow and astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin.
Shallue, a senior software engineer with Google’s research team Google AI, came up with the idea to apply a neural network to Kepler data. He became interested in exoplanet discovery after learning that astronomy, like other branches of science, is rapidly being inundated with data as the technology for data collection from space advances.
“In my spare time, I started googling for ‘finding exoplanets with large data sets’ and found out about the Kepler mission and the huge data set available,” said Shallue. “Machine learning really shines in situations where there is so much data that humans can’t search it for themselves.”
Kepler’s four-year dataset consists of 35,000 possible planetary signals. Automated tests, and sometimes human eyes, are used to verify the most promising signals in the data. However, the weakest signals often are missed using these methods. Shallue and Vanderburg thought there could be more interesting exoplanet discoveries faintly lurking in the data.
First, they trained the neural network to identify transiting exoplanets using a set of 15,000 previously-vetted signals from the Kepler exoplanet catalogue. In the test set, the neural network correctly identified true planets and false positives 96 percent of the time.
Then, with the neural network having “learned” to detect the pattern of a transiting exoplanet, the researchers directed their model to search for weaker signals in 670 star systems that already had multiple known planets. Their assumption was that multiple-planet systems would be the best places to look for more exoplanets.
“We got lots of false positives of planets, but also potentially more real planets,” said Vanderburg. “It’s like sifting through rocks to find jewels. If you have a finer sieve then you will catch more rocks but you might catch more jewels, as well.”
Kepler-90i wasn’t the only jewel this neural network sifted out. In the Kepler-80 system, they found a sixth planet. This one, the Earth-sized Kepler-80g, and four of its neighboring planets form what is called a resonant chain – where planets are locked by their mutual gravity in a rhythmic orbital dance. The result is an extremely stable system, similar to the seven planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system.
Their research paper reporting these findings has been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal. Shallue and Vanderburg plan to apply their neural network to Kepler’s full set of more than 150,000 stars.
Kepler has produced an unprecedented data set for exoplanet hunting. After gazing at one patch of space for four years, the spacecraft now is operating on an extended mission and switches its field of view every 80 days.
“These results demonstrate the enduring value of Kepler’s mission,” said Jessie Dotson, Kepler’s project scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley.
“New ways of looking at the data – such as this early-stage research to apply machine learning algorithms – promises to continue to yield significant advances in our understanding of planetary systems around other stars. I’m sure there are more firsts in the data waiting for people to find them.”",1
"The US labor market continues to hum.
US companies added 156,000 nonfarm payrolls in December, which was a bit lighter than the 175,000 expected. On the plus side, November’s payrolls number was revised up by 19,000 to 204,000.
December marked the 75th straight month of job growth in the US.
As expected, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7% from 4.6% in November. This came as the labor force participation rate climbed to 62.7% from 62.6% a month ago.
Importantly, wages are heating up. Average hourly earnings grew 0.4% month-over-month, which was better than the 0.3% expected. It was also a significant improvement from the 0.1% decline in November.
On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings climbed by 2.9%, which is the fastest pace of growth since June 2009.
Below is a look at jobs added by industry.
Manufacturing jobs, which have been closely watched lately, increased by 17,000 during the month. This included the addition of 2,900 payrolls in the motor vehicles and parts industry.
Below is a look at unemployment rates by demographic.
Since the election, business and consumer surveys have been upbeat about the election of Republican Donald Trump.
Importantly, employment sub-indexes for the ISM manufacturing, Philly Fed, and Kansas City Fed survey jumped in December.
On the services side, employment indexes from the Philly Fed and New York Fed signal job growth. However, the employment sub-index of the national ISM non-manufacturing index signal a deceleration in growth.
The election of Trump is a bit of a wild card for the next several months as he has promised major policy changes that could affect behavior.

"LONDON — A Conservative British MP wants Facebook to hand over information on Russian-linked ads in relation to the last year's Brexit referendum and this year's general election.
In the open letter addressed to the company's co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, Damian Collins says the request is part of his country's ongoing inquiry into what he calls ""the phenomenon of fake news."" He said in his letter that the probe focuses on the role of foreign actors ""abusing platforms such as yours to interfere in the political discourse of other nations.""
Collins, who chairs the UK House of Commons digital committee, specifically requested details relating to any advertisements and pages paid for, or set up, by Russian-linked accounts.
The Tory MP is also asking for information on who was targeted, how many times they were viewed and how much money was paid for them.
""I believe that the information that I have requested is in line with that already supplied by Facebook to several United States Senate Committees, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, in relation to the 2016 US Presidential Election,"" Collins said in the letter.
A Facebook spokesperson said the company received the letter and ""will respond once we have had the opportunity to review the request.""
Last month, Facebook announced it would give Congress thousands of advertisements suspected to be linked to the Russian attempt to undermine last year's presidential election.
An earlier Facebook investigation found that an influence operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on thousands of ads promoting divisive social and political messages in a two-year-period.
Facebook said many of the 3,000 ads promoted 470 ""inauthentic"" accounts and pages that it has now suspended. The ads spread polarizing views on topics including immigration rather than backing a particular political candidate. Another $50,000 went to about 2,200 ""potentially politically related"" ads and might have been bought by Russians in potential violation of U. S. election law.
In the weeks following the announcement, Zuckerberg promised Facebook would implement additional measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of political advertisements. He said the review process for political advertisements will be beefed up and advertisers will have to disclose who paid for their ads.
Many of Facebook's five million advertisers are able to set up their campaigns without ever needing to work with a human on the other end.",0

Black Wannabe Rachel Dolezal: Now Unemployed, On Food Stamps, Soon To Be Homeless #BLM
Rachel Dolezal, the white woman who pretended to be African-American in order to make inroads with the black activist community, may soon be on the streets. Once the head of the NAACP branch in Spokane, Washington, the 39-year-old is now unemployed and on food stamps. She expects to be homeless soon, according to Fox News.
In an in-depth interview with The Guardian published Saturday, the former race hustler remained unapologetic, claiming that for two years she’s been shunned as a result of her subjectively-defined black identity.
“I’m not going to stoop and apologize and grovel,” she told The Guardian.
Complaining about her lot in life like a good leftist, Dolezal has discovered that when you play the game of identity politics and lose, you lose everything. To Dolezal’s chagrin, all of her leftist comrades, her fellow black activists in arms, have turned on her, leaving her dejected and jobless.

Boeing 787 leaving huge vapour trail through the sky
INCREDIBLE VIDEO SHOWS HUGE CHEMTRAIL FOLLOWING PLANE OVER RUSSIA
Incredible close-up footage of a passenger plane leaving a huge vapour trail through the sky while flying over Russia has emerged online.
The stunning video shot from another plane shows the long trail left behind by a Boeing 787.
The plane was flying over the east coast of Russia at the time and perfectly shows a condensation trail forming at 33,000 feet in the air.
The person who filmed the video wrote online: “This contrail looks dark against the rising sun.”

"Twenty-eight Europe-bound displaced people and transients were discovered dead on a day of distraught salvages off Libya on Tuesday, incorporating no less than 22 in an overburdened wooden watercraft, a picture taker and the Italian Coast Guard said. The picture taker, who could get onto the vessel, said it gave the idea that a hefty portion of the dead had choked.
He said there were in regards to 1,000 individuals on three levels. He tallied 22 bodies and said there were all the more dead in the hold. The coast protect — which is organizing salvage endeavors in universal waters north of Libya — said 28 bodies had been recuperated throughout 33 operations on Tuesday, while 4,655 displaced people and transients had been saved.
The picture taker was going on the Astral, a boat sanctioned by Spanish non-administrative association ProActiva Open Arms, which salvages evacuees and transients adrift. Late on Tuesday, the Italian Navy assumed control helping survivors and recovering bodies, the picture taker said. It was yet one more day of dramatization adrift after more than 6,000 individuals, a large portion of them Africans in pressed elastic dinghies, were saved off Libya on Monday. Nine bodies were found in those operations, including a pregnant lady.
With various salvage watercrafts on the way to Italy to empty the colossal human payload gathered on Monday, the Astral was allowed to sit unbothered to manage the overburden wooden watercraft for a few hours. The Astral was supported just by rafts dropped by a Spanish military plane until the Italian Navy landed at late morning. There was frenzy locally available, with individuals bouncing into the water, the picture taker said.
The Astral’s salvage operations had started before daybreak and kept going until sunset. The most recent individuals to be protected will add to a sum of around 132,000 evacuees and vagrants who have arrived at Italy’s southern ports so far this year, escaping struggle, destitution or abuse, and wanting to begin new lives in Europe. The fresh introductions are for the most part Africans who plan to attempt to get to northern Europe, yet progressively are obliged to look for haven or the privilege to stay in Italy, where gathering focuses have been strained to blasting point.",1
"“These experiments with water are the first of their kind, allowing us to witness a fundamental disorder-to-order transition in one of the most abundant molecules in the universe,” said study lead author Arianna Gleason, a postdoctoral fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory and a visiting scientist in the Extreme Environments Laboratory of Stanford’s School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences.
Scientists have long studied how materials undergo phase changes between gas, liquid and solid states. Phase changes can happen rapidly, however, and on the tiny scale of mere atoms. Previous research has struggled to capture the moment-to-moment action of phase transitions, and instead worked backward from stable solids in piecing together the molecular steps taken by predecessor liquids.
“There have been a tremendous number of studies on ice because everyone wants to understand its behavior,” said study senior author Wendy Mao, an associate professor of geological sciences and a Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences (SIMES) principal investigator. “What our new study demonstrates, and which hasn’t been done before, is the ability to see the ice structure form in real time.”
Catching ice in the act
Those timescales became achievable thanks to the Linac Coherent Light Source, the world’s most powerful X-ray laser located at the nearby SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. There, the science team beamed an intense, green-colored laser at a small target containing a sample of liquid water. The laser instantly vaporized layers of diamond on one side of the target, generating a rocket-like force that compressed the water to pressures exceeding 50,000 times that of Earth’s atmosphere at sea level.
As the water compacted, a separate beam from an instrument called the X-ray Free Electron Laser arrived in a series of bright pulses only a femtosecond, or a quadrillionth of a second, long. Akin to camera flashes, this strobing X-ray laser snapped a set of images revealing the progression of molecular changes, flip book–style, while the pressurized water crystallized into ice VII. The phase change took just 6 billionths of a second, or nanoseconds. Surprisingly, during this process, the water molecules bonded into rod shapes, and not spheres as theory predicted.
The platform developed for this study – combining high pressure with snapshot images – could help researchers probe the myriad ways water freezes, depending on pressure and temperature. Under the conditions on our planet’s surface, water crystallizes in only one way, dubbed ice Ih (“ice one-H”) or simply “hexagonal ice,” whether in glaciers or ice cube trays in the freezer.
Delving into extraterrestrial ice types, including ice VII, will help scientists model such remote environments as comet impacts, the internal structures of potentially life-supporting, water-filled moons like Jupiter’s Europa, and the dynamics of jumbo, rocky, oceanic exoplanets called super-Earths.
“Any icy satellite or planetary interior is intimately connected to the object’s surface,” Gleason said. “Learning about these icy interiors will help us understand how the worlds in our solar system formed and how at least one of them, so far as we know, came to have all the necessary characteristics for life.”

"()In a discussion recently, someone pointed out some very interesting observations they’d made and the final piece to this puzzle brings together could very possibly be a False Flag op in the making.
In mid-July, there was that huge glitch at Southwest Airlines that delayed flights leaving thousands of travelers stranded for hours, the cause was blamed on a widespread computer outrage and almost all flights out of its Chicago hub were grounded because of a technical glitch.
Yesterday, the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration briefly suspended flights at Miami International and nearby airports around noon on Thursday following a power outage at Miami’s Terminal Radar Approach Control.
With this outage all communications were down as well, so no contact between the pilots and runway were possible.
The list of these sort of glitches goes on and on and it seems all of the airlines have expereinced these issues.
Why has mainstream media remained silent about these technical difficulties?
Check out this Google Search for many more examples.
A techinical issue that occurred at LAX in whicha regional air traffic control computer system misinterpreted a U-2 spy plane’s flight plan last week, grounding hundreds of planes at airports across the southwest.
The FAA halted flights into Los Angeles airspace for about 90 minutes because of “technical issues” at its air traffic control center in Palmdale.
Officials stated that the malfunction occurred when a computer system incorrectly processed a flight plan for a nearby U-2 aircraft that was flying around 60,000 feet.
The software interpreted that plan’s route as below 10,000 feet, where it conflicted with hundreds of other flight plans.
The U-2 plane was in the area for a training exercise.
Apparently, the spy plane’s programs screw with the airlines software, causing major interference and throwing the system off.
Given these factors it would appear something weird is going on.
The source I spoke tosaid they hadn’t given much thought to these airline events until last night, as they were gazing up at the stars, they’d almost witnessed amid air collisionbetween 2 airplanes.
The last statement made by this person is the one that gives one pause.
“Seems to me that someone is testing the system to do something.”
Is it possible that The “Powers That Be” are setting us up for another 911 scenario?
If contact is lost and if the Control Tower was unable to locate the airplanesit would be a perfect time to hijack a plane.
Or could it be for a total chaos factor in the air, either for a distraction or to put more fear in peoples’ hearts?
The result of such an event would then give the government the ability to pass more Orwellianlaws so they gain more control.
Hence tighten the chains on our freedoms even more, just as it happened with 9/11.
We were warned over a year ago whenthe Washington Examiner reported,”The next terrorist attacks are most likely to be against U. S. power grids, dams, air traffic control centers and other areas of vital infrastructure, said the co-author of a controversial cyber security bill in recent days.”
Are these glitches part of a larger conspiracy or are these normal events that just happen once in a while?

"The Moroccan-born rapper, who grew up in the South Bronx, was inspired to visit the country in February after coming across Uganda's ""Triplets Ghetto Kids,"" whose dancing videos on YouTube went viral last year.
""I listen to a lot of African music, so me just scrolling through the computer I seen them kids and I saw something that I never saw before,"" French said. ""I saw art; I saw kids that were rich on the inside. I saw a lot of love.""
The rapper said that he was supposed to shoot his music video for his single ""Unforgettable,"" featuring California rapper Swae Lee, ""in Hawaii or something like that but I decided I wanted to go to Africa, especially because that's my roots.""

A post shared by French Montana (@frenchmontana) on Apr 9, 2017 at 5:07pm PDT
After a 30-hour flight, French and Lee, along with their teams, arrived in the capital of Kampala, where they met the kids and visited the Suubi Health Center, a maternity and children's health clinic that serves 56,000 people but is greatly underfunded.
""Once we got there, I saw life for what it was out there. Three-hundred thousand people, they have two rooms and one ambulance,"" French said, describing the medical facility. ""I feel like every kid and mother need the proper health care and it kind of hurt me. It made my heart heavy for them ... it touched me so much I said I'm going to make a change, probably not for the whole world but at least right here.""

The infant mortality rate in the United States in 2016 was about five deaths of infants under one year old per 1,000 live births, whereas as in Uganda the infant mortality rate was 54 deaths per 1,000 births that same year, according to the CIA factbook.
Since returning from Uganda, French partnered with Global Citizen's #2BSTRONG Campaign and Mama Hope, a US-based non-proft organization, to launch his ""#Unforgettable Healthcare Campaign,"" which has so far raised over $226,000, including a $100,000 from French, himself and most recently, a $100,000 donation from Canadian singer The Weeknd.
""I feel like especially with artists like me and other artists that have a platform to showcase this kind of message and show a difference and really go out there and do it -- not just speak about it and post about it on Instagram,"" French said. ""I feel like we gotta show action nowadays.""
The donations are expected to more than double the reach of the Suubi Health Center and will allow the center to purchase a new ambulance, premature incubators, beds, cribs and other maternity supplies.",0
"If Wall Street bulls are right, traderson the floor of the NewYork Stock Exchange will soon be wearing ""Dow 23,000"" rally caps.
Dow 23,000 —which is just a fewpoints away —would be more than just another impressive number. It would be a freshreminder that U. S. stocks are at yet another all-time high.
And that approaching milestone posesanage-old dilemma for investors: Is getting into the market at lofty levels a good orbad idea?
So far this year, people who played it safe and viewed any of the Dow Jones industrial average's 48 record highs as a market top probably regret their decision. They have missed out on big gains.
As of Friday, the Dow has appreciated 15.7% in 2017 to 22,872 —blowing past20,000, 21,000 and 22,000 along the way. An investor who put $10,000in a bank savings account at the start of the year instead of investing in the Dow, has missed out on a paper gain of $1,570.
And now that the 121-year-old stock index, which ismade up of 30 blue-chip American companies such asMerck, McDonald's and Microsoftis within striking distance of""23K"", it doesn't mean it can't go higher.
Some Wall Street pros say hold off on buying a souvenir ""Dow 23,000"" cap because it likely will be out of style soonand replaced by ""Dow 24,000"" or ""Dow 25,000"" hats.
The reason: Dow 24,000 might not be far behind as there’s nothing on the horizon that screams market top or rally killer, bulls say.There’s no irrational exuberance. No runaway inflation. No hintof a coming interest rate spike. And no signs of recession.
And that means —barring some unforeseen shock such as a nuclear war or some other out-of-the blue event that causes a mass exodus from stocks— there are low odds of a stock market meltdown anytime soon.
""Dow 23,000 could spark a market melt-up,"" saysEd Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, referring to a buying frenzy that leads to a steep and rapid rise in stock prices that no one saw coming.
The melt-up could drive investors now on the sidelines to pileback into the stock market at the same time.
""The pain of missing out becomes more intense, as does thepressure to just jump in,"" Yardeni adds.
The Dow, Yarendi predicts,could climb to 25,000 by the middle of next year.

Corporate profit growthhas been good, he says, with numbers posted in the first half of the year the best since 2011. The market, while pricey based on a historical price-to-earnings basis, isn't as rich as it appears when low interest rates and tepid inflation are factored in. And major anxieties such as Greece getting ""booted out of the eurozone"" have faded amid an economic rebound in Europe and most other parts of the world.
""We have spent the past few years coming up with things to worry about that have all turned out to be non-events,"" Yardeni says. ""Now, the market doesn't seem to fear turmoil."".
The Dow has been powered higher this year by global giants, such as  Boeing, up nearly 68%;credit-card payment processor Visa, up 39%;heavy equipment-maker Caterpillar, up 41%;McDonald's, up almost 36%;and Apple, up nearly 36%.
But not everyone is calling for the Dow to run away to the upside.
“It would be hard for me to get wildly bullish at Dow 23K,” says Bill Hornbarger, chief investment officer at St. Louis-based money-management firm Moneta Group.
This is a time for investor caution not complacency, he says.
Just because stocks overall havebeen in a relative state of calmand haven't suffered a dropof 5% or more since June 2016 when markets got spooked by the Brexit vote, that doesn't mean investors should rule out a sell-off, especially since the market is expensive relative to history.
""This is when investors have to be on guard,"" Hornbarger says, noting that stocks tend to produce lower returns when valuations are at lofty starting levels as they are now.
For investors with a cautious streak, Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG in New York, offers this advice: ""You might want to take some chips off the table. The Dow is up more than 15%, so you might want to consider locking that gain in.""
Others disagree. If the latest 1,000-point milestone occurs, it won't be a sign of a Dow careening toward a major market wreck, says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, a Minneapolis-based investmentfirm.
Paulsen is upbeat in large part because the run tonew highs has included a wide swath of stocks from many different industry groups, which is a sign of strength.
""It's not just tech, it's not just Apple,"" he says. Small-company stocks are at record highs, and seven of the market's 11 main industry groups are up more than 10% this year, including financial stocks, health care shares and utilities, toname a few.
And the continued rise in the market has yet to result in irrational exuberance— or an ""all-in mentality"" among investors — that often occurs at market tops, Paulsen argues.
""I would be a lot more concerned if there was wild bullishness,""Paulsen says.
What would cause him to turn cautious on stocks? Dow 25,000. That milestone would be a huge headline, he says, one that would likely ""impact the mind-set and sentiment"" of investors.
If ""the culture of thecountry"" took on a much more bullish mind-set, ""I would get more conservative,""Paulsen says.",0
"IRBIL, Iraq — U. S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter spent a second day in Iraq Sunday, this time assuring Kurdish leaders that the coalition will provide the necessary air resources to help their forces liberate Mosul — while also warning that the international community needs to be prepared to reconstruct the Iraq's second largest city.
""We need to make sure that the non-military campaign doesn't lag behind the coalition,"" said Carter, who added that he's ""encouraged by the progress"" of the military campaign. ""My mind is already thinking ahead to the desperate need for stabilization and reconstruction.""
While in Irbil, roughly 24 miles from the front lines, Carter told the prime minister of the Kurdish Regional Government, Necheran Barzani, on Sunday that the coalition will provide the necessary air resources to take back Mosul.
Related: Mosul: Who Are Key Players Trying to Recapture ISIS Stronghold?
The Iraq-led offensive against ISIS in Mosul is entering its seventh day, with Iraqi counter terrorism units and the Kurdish peshmerga encountering increased resistance from as many as 7,000 fighters.
Coalition forces could face fiercer combat as they get closer to the city's center, where U. S. officials expect an estimated 1,000 foreign fighters to mount a last stand.
Carter is also focusing his attention on how to defend Europe and America from potential counter-strikes by the group, also known as the Islamic State in Iraq, as the territory they control in the Middle East shrinks.
""I am very watchful about attacks on the homeland,"" Carter said in Baghdad Saturday. ""My job is to make sure Americans sleep at night and that is what keeps me up at night.""
Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the U. S.commander of the coalition in Baghdad, said that the resistance has ""stiffened in the last couple of days."" He added on Sunday that Barzani and his own sources reported that the peshmerga had ""considerable success"" in recapturing Bashiqa, a town near Mosul.
Nonetheless, Townsend said that ISIS is attempting to direct the attention of coalition forces away from the campaign on Mosul. ""We have seen a complex attack on Rutbah,"" he said, referring to the city about 265 miles west of Baghdad. The assault follows a similar attack recently on the city of Kirkuk.
As an example of the ISIS' unconventional tactics, U. S. officials cited a sulfur factory north of U.S. military staging positions that the terrorist group set on fire earlier this week. When the wind shifted to the south on Saturday, hazardous fumes blew towards a a coalition base, known as Q-West, south of Mosul.
Almost 1,000 people suffered from breathing problems related to toxic gases from the fire, Reuters reported, with victims arriving for treatment as early as Friday. Some soldiers donned gas masks, while air samples were sent the U. S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency for analysis.
Some Kurdish combat forces had complained that they were not receiving the air support that they expected from the coalition, but a Kurdish official said Sunday that the situation had improved. ""Now we have good support,"" said Kurdish Brig. Gen. Halgord Hekmet.
""Our number one request is armored vehicles,"" he said. ""Most peshmerga got killed because they are riding in normal cars."" Twenty five peshmerga have been killed since the operation began, Hekmet added.
While officials insist that Iraqi forces are taking the lead, more Americans are in harm's way. On Thursday, Navy Chief Petty Officer Jason Finan, a 34-year old from Anaheim, California, was the first to American to be killed since the campaign began.
His death ""underscores a fact, which is what we are doing over here and what you are doing, is serious business,"" Carter said. ""It's not a game.""
Between 100 and 200 U. S. special forces are working to help the advance of Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Approximately 5,000 American military personnel are in the country, with roughly 500 outside of U.S. bases.
As Iraqi and Kurdish forces fight through the outer ring of ISIS' defense in Mosul, facing vehicle-borne suicide bombers and burning trenches of oil, U. S. military planners are confident of victory and already looking towards toppling Raqqa, the ISIS' capital in Syria.
Meanwhile, Carter has also been attempting to mediate a dispute between Turkey and Iraq on how involved Turkish forces will be in Mosul. After meeting with Turkey's president in Anakara on Friday, Carter said that he had ""an agreement in principle"" on Turkey's role in the campaign.
But in Baghdad, he appeared to dial down those aspirations and said the Iraqi government essentially had vetoed Turkish participation. ""I also affirmed to you today the vital importance of every country operating with full respect to Iraqi sovereignty,"" Carter said after meeting with Prime Minister Haider al-Badi.",0
"Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this story, from the Associated Press, provided incorrect information about home interest deductions.
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have pledged to overhaul the nation's complex tax code. To slash taxes, they say they'll curb a web of expensive deductions and credits to allow more revenue to flow to the government.
Problem is, they're likely to run into a wall of resistance from people and groups drawn together by a singular warning: Don't touch my deduction.
Major cherished tax breaks — from deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations to incentives for 401(k) contributions — have deep-pocketed supporters and lobbyists who are sure to fight to preserve those benefits. They add up to hundreds of billions of dollars in lost potential revenue that could otherwise go to rebuilding roads and bridges or social programs or even to help finance broader tax cuts for people and companies.
""On every single item, there's a group out there ready to battle,"" says Thomas Cooke, a professor and tax expert at Georgetown University.
This makes the outlook thorny for a tax rewrite effort this fall, a Trump priority that Republicans consider a political imperative looking ahead to next year's midterm elections. The collapse of GOP health care legislation raises the stakes for taxes, with Trump's team talking about action by year's end.
More: Ask a Fool: Which companies would benefit most from tax reform?
Jamie Dimon: America needs tax reform to spur competition and growth
The president and the GOP agree on the broad goals: Simplifying the tax code, lowering the rate for corporations from the current 15-35 percent range, and bringing relief for the middle class. But details have to be filled in.
""First, we need a tax code that is simple, fair and easy to understand,"" Trump said Wednesday at a rally in Missouri. ""That means getting rid of the loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests.""
Among the seemingly unassailable benefits, the most cherished may well be the deduction of interest paid on mortgages. Touted as a pillar in the promotion of homeownership, the benefit cost the government an estimated $77 billion in the budget year that ended last Sept. 30, according to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.
The benefit allows homeowners to deduct interest on up to $1 million in mortgage debt on a primary (and a secondary) residence. It is fiercely defended by the National Association of Realtors, which spent $64.8 million on lobbying on various issues last year including the mortgage deduction, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Roughly 28 million Americans deduct mortgage interest from their income taxes, with the biggest concentrations in the high housing-cost states of California, New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Maryland, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.
House Republicans say they've got a more efficient way to encourage home buying. Under their plan, the standard deduction would be increased from the current $12,600 for married couples filing jointly, for example, to $24,000. They argue that a majority of homeowners would no longer choose to itemize deductions and claim the mortgage-interest benefit. They'd be better off using the bigger standard deduction.
Another possibility is halving the mortgage deduction to $500,000. That would surely set up a pitched battle.
Employees' earnings from defined-contribution retirement plans such as 401(k)s aren't taxed until retirement; pay-ins by both employers and employees also receive tax-preferred status. That cost $82.7 billion in the most recent budget year.
Among the ideas circulating among some Republicans is reversing that by taxing investment earnings upfront, not upon retirement; or reducing the limits on pre-tax contributions.
With about 55 million U. S. workers holding some $5 trillion in their 401(k) accounts, the plans have become a touchstone of retirement security for the middle class.
A coalition of groups representing employers, consumers and the financial industry recently expressed concern to the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. With lawmakers looking for revenue sources to offset prospective tax cuts, ""Any changes to the retirement system made solely for short-term budgetary gains, and not for policy reasons, could hurt Americans' long-term retirement security,"" the Save Our Savings coalition said in a letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
Deductions for donations to charitable, religious and other nonprofit organizations. Estimated cost: $41.5 billion. Americans are generous, House Republicans note, and charitable giving should be encouraged with a tax incentive. But only 25 percent of taxpayers benefit from the deduction because the rest don't itemize. The solution is to make the charitable deduction more efficient by simplifying taxpayers' compliance and record-keeping, the Republican plan says.
Under the plan, all itemized deductions would be eliminated except for two: mortgage interest and charitable donations.
Tax-free employer-paid health insurance premiums and other medical expenses, including long-term care insurance, clocking in at $143.8 billion. Employees aren't taxed on the benefits, while employers can deduct them as a business expense.
Tax credit for children under age 17, $55 billion. An individual can claim a $1,000 credit for each qualifying child. The credit starts phasing out for single filers earning over $75,000 a year and for joint filers earning over $110,000.
Some lawmakers have proposed increasing the credit to $2,500, by combining the exemption for dependents and the child care credit. Organizations including the Child Poverty Action Group and the National Association for the Education of Young Children have stressed the importance of using tax policy to help children and families. They express concern that such benefits for children could get caught up in the Republicans' drive to eliminate ""special interest"" loopholes in the tax overhaul.
Rep. Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who heads the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged in a recent speech, ""The fight will get tough.""",0

Christmas in Ethiopia: it comes but twice a year
If western-style December hijinks aren’t enough, why not head for the Ethiopian highlands and join the country’s January Christmas celebrations – and take in a trekking holiday while you’re at it
 Read about more unusual Christmases in Las Vegas, Japan and Java
efore dawn, our guide Sefiwe was waiting for our little group to gather. In the darkness, we joined the flocks of white-robed pilgrims and made our way towards the rock-hewn church of Bet Maryam (House of Mary).
It was very early morning on 7 January: Christmas Day for the Ethiopian Orthodox church. We were in Lalibela, the town in the northern highlands that Ethiopian Christians consider their Jerusalem.
A world heritage site, the Churches of Lalibela – 13 in all – were carved out of rock in the 12th century after King Lalibela had a vision – quite a common occurrence in Ethiopian history. They are cut vertically downwards, so when we stood outside St Mary’s, the candles held by the milling worshippers illuminated a sheer facing cliff eight metres high.
All around us pilgrims were chanting. Just before 7am, in the day’s first light, a procession of 400 priests, including the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox church in his magnificent hat, progressed to the cliff-top above us. They stood in their white turbans, holding coloured shawls, shaking sistrums (a sort of musical rattle), swaying in unison and chanting to the sounds of slow drums and horns. And the congregation burst out ululating and clapping for joy.
“They represent the heavenly host,” explained Sefiwe, “the priests down here are the shepherds.”

It was a far cry from our usual Christmas in Oxfordshire – and a first: we had never had a double Christmas. First we flew to Zanzibar and had a beachside celebration on 25 December. Then, on Boxing Day, we arrived in Addis Ababa, with our two sons and their partners, and also our nieces, who had pricked up their ears at the first mention of our trip and joined in, bringing our number to nine.
Ethiopia was somewhere we had always wanted to go, and we found a fantastic way to do it when we read (in a Guardian Green Travel supplement) about Tesfa Tours, a “community tourism” company that takes groups trekking in the highlands, staying in villages as guests of rural communities.
Tours usually combine a visit to several attractions – Bahir Dar on Lake Tana (the source of the Blue Nile), Gondar (a former capital founded in the 17th century) and Lalibela – with a major trek. Longer trips take in the ancient city of Axum and treks in the less-explored area of Tigray.
After visiting Lake Tana’s spectacular monasteries and the palaces of Gondar, we drove for five hours into the Wollo Highlands to start our trek at Werkhaye Mariam.
There we were greeted by Belay, our guide and interpreter for the trek (our hosts spoke the local Amharic language). Our luggage was put on five donkeys and we began four extraordinary days as our cavalcade made its way through farmland and woodland, and along the edge of an escarpment with views that reminded me of the Grand Canyon.
We ate lunch in a wide tukul – a wattle-and-daub round house with pointed rush roof, like the rondavels of east Africa.
Lunch – every day – was traditional Ethiopian fare, which meant injera – an unappealing-looking pancake made from teff, a seed unique to the Horn of Africa, which is fermented then cooked to look like a dirty grey flannel. On it are laid deliciously spicy vegetables which you eat with your right hand, wrapping the food in the injera. Despite its looks, we all developed a taste for it – it is high in iron and Ethiopians swear by its health-giving properties.
By the time we reached the settlement of Mequat Mariam at dusk, we had walked 15km from Werkhaye Mariam. We settled into our three large tukul bedrooms and watched the sunset. Through our guide, the cook explained that she had been trained in Lalibela to prepare food appropriate to western tastes. And certainly our evening meals – eaten in a communal tukul – were delicious.
Our first host told us that he and his fellow farmers had been cautious about hosting tourists. But it had worked out well. During the wet planting season they would be too busy working their fields but, in the dry season, they had the time.
The wildlife was thrilling. We saw rock lizards and rodent-like hyraxes; across the fields, gelada baboons would suddenly come into view; above the valley, two Augur buzzards had a spirited tiff and then huge bearded vultures would sail by.
But the thing that will remain with me above all else was the courtesy and generosity of our hosts. Ethiopians are without doubt some of the most beautiful people in the world. They are proud of their country. They have lived through horrifying wars – we learned so much from our guides.
In Ethiopia, almost everything is a surprise. There is a different calendar; it is one of only two countries in Africa not to have been colonised (though the Italians under Mussolini occupied it from 1935-1941); and its Christian religion – which came via the Levant and was established in the fourth century AD – bears strong links to Judaism, which had got there first. And never have I been in a place where there are two such strongly held, parallel views of history: what we know happened and what Ethiopians believe happened – what writer and scholar Karen Armstrong calls logos and mythos – co-exist. And the mythos is more fun.
Ethiopians believe their rulers were descended from Menelik, child of the union between King Solomon and The Queen of Sheba. Hence Haile Selassie, their last emperor, deposed and later (most believe) killed by the Communist Derg in 1975, was the lion of Judah and is still revered by many.
Religion is all-pervasive. Mary is particularly loved – “Mariam” appears in many place names. The seven archangels feature prominently and Saint George is the national patron saint, usually portrayed slaying a dragon – though in one 20th-century version he is seeing off an Italian general. Monastery and church frescos depict many unfamiliar local saints.
And so our walk progressed. We were woken daily by a cacophony of cocks crowing deep in the valley, followed by the gentle, rhythmic thud of a lady grinding freshly roasted coffee with a pestle – Ethiopia is said to be the original home of coffee. That was the signal to get up, make a dash for the one eco-toilet and then watch the spellbinding sunrise across the valley.
A good breakfast of omelettes and toast was each day washed down with thick coffee, and then we’d be off for another 20km amble, at an altitude of between 2,800 and 3,000 metres. More adventurous trekkers can walk at 4,000 metres and reach the peak of Abuna Yosef, one of Ethiopia’s highest mountains.
On our final day we walked to the road, to be picked up by Jeeps and driven to Lalibela. There we stayed four nights until Ethiopian Christmas morning. During that period, thousands of pilgrims – priests, monks, nuns, peasants – converged on Lalibela, setting up camps in sites specially set aside for them.
This tradition goes back 1,000 years and feels little changed. For the whole of Christmas Eve there were services in the churches and spontaneous singing and chanting in the streets. It was wondrous to watch. After the dawn service on 7 January, the pilgrims began their return home.
And so did we, feeling moved and privileged to have been part of a tradition which is at the heart of this extraordinary country.

"“In this place, you can’t ask why,” said Debby Lottering of her home town, Manenberg.
A suburb of Cape Town, South Africa, Manenberg was established in the Cape Flats, a vast low-lying sand dune, during the late 1960s by the apartheid government as an area for Coloured families. Marginalized by geography, history and a dominant culture, today most of Manenberg’s estimated 35,000 to 52,000 residents live in overcrowded and problematic conditions. There are around 8,000 households in Manenberg, 52 percent of which are headed by women.
Nearly25 years since the end of apartheid, Manenberg has not seen the fruits of democracy. Opportunities to change or improve circumstances remain few and far between. Debby, 28, and her sister Naomi, 31, were raised in Manenberg inside a one-bedroom flat by their father, Franz, and mother, Harriet, who died in the early 2000s.
I first photographed Manenberg in June 2011. Through the years, many individuals have opened their lives and shared their community with me with extraordinary candor, especially Naomi and Debby. The sisters’ personalities are as different as the lives they’re pursuing.
Naomi is smart, fierce, funny and vulnerable. She and I met in Sea Point, an affluent Cape Town neighborhood where Naomi was living on the streets. She brought me to Manenberg for the first time and introduced me to her family. She started spending nights on the streets in her early teens to escape the predictability of home. She experimented with alcohol, drugs and sex. The temporary escape they provided drew her further and further away. For years she’s checked in with her family when she felt like it, sometimes every other week, sometimes not for months at a time. Debby and Franz love her unconditionally. Recently she’s been sick from complications of HIV and tuberculosis and has been sticking close to home.
Debby is strong as a rock, loyal, clear-eyed and full of faith. A single mother of three, she works 50 hours a week at Pinto’s, a restaurant roughly an hour away by bus from Manenberg. When her kids aren’t at school, they go to their grandfather Franz’s home until she picks them up. Debby and I chat almost daily on WhatsApp. We talk about our families, our dogs (her dog is the mother of my dog), the gossip from Manenberg and the news of where and who the gangs are shooting.
The community is largely recognized in South African media for its social problems — unemployment, crime, substance abuse and above all, relentless gang violence. Over one week in mid-August 2017, 128 shootings were recorded. Known as one of the country’s most violent places, faith and fortitude help the people of Manenberg look to the future.
Shipping containers used as homes in Manenberg in March 2014. During the apartheid, many of Manenberg’s first residents were removed from thriving neighborhoods near Cape Town’s city center and relocated to Manenberg. In recent years, attempts have been made by the city to improve living conditions by renovating the rowhouses built in the 1960s. Gang violence in Manenberg prevented the completion of the renovations and families were forced to settle in shipping containers for up to a year that were intended for short-term use. Many containers housed four to 12 family members.(Sarah Stacke)

The decision by Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe (D.) not to cooperate with a White House commission examining voting processes in federal elections comes after a year in which the governor circumvented the commonwealth’s supreme court to restore voting rights for convicted felons and stalled efforts by the Virginia legislature to fight voter fraud.
McAuliffe announced on Thursday evening he has “no intention of honoring” arequestfor publicly available voter data made by the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which was established through a Mayexecutive orderand is being led by Vice President Mike Pence.
McAuliffe stated in his rejection that there is “no evidence” of voter fraud in Virginia, and that the “only irregularity in the 2016 presidential election centered around Russian tampering.” He also stated his belief that the commission was set up as a “tool to commit large-scale voter suppression.”
The governor’s statement was echoed by other Democratic officials across the country, including both California’s Democratic secretary of stateAlex Padillaand Kentucky’s Democratic secretary of stateAlison Lundergan Grimes, afailedSenate candidate.
McAuliffe, whose office did not respond to requests for comment, has already vetoed numerous attempts this year by the Virginia legislature to limit the possibility of voter fraud in the commonwealth’s elections, despite the fact that5,500noncitizens have been identified on its voter rolls.
In February, McAuliffevetoedlegislation that would have triggered investigations in jurisdictions that had more people registered to vote than people who were eligible to vote.
The legislation followed areportthat looked at a sample of just 8 of Virginia’s 133 jurisdictions and found more than 1,000 individuals who were illegally registered.
McAuliffe alsovetoeda March bill that would have required the Virginia Department of Elections to notify local registrars of voters who were registered to vote in other states.
In both cases McAuliffe cited the “administrative burden” that would be put on localities, which was not an issue for the governor in 2016 when he attempted to rush the restoration of voting rights for more than 200,000 Virginia felons.
Local registrars complained that they had “no forewarning at all” of McAuliffe’s order and were left unprepared to help individuals they were made responsible for.
“We had phones that were ringing off the hook,” said a local Hanover county registrar. “It was really a shock to me and my staff that this was coming.”
“Our concerns were how the process was going to be handled,” said another registrar. “It’s not only been haphazard for registrars’ offices, think of the individuals affected.”
Mistakes were made as the state rushed to get McAuliffe’s order executed before the 2016 election—voting rights were restored for132 individualsthat remained in custody because they were deemed “sexually violent predators,” andseveral violent felonsthat remained in prison were discovered to have mistakenly had rights restored.
Included were a man that attempted to murder a woman by locking her in a house after lighting a mattress on fire, and another who pointed his gun at a state trooper while fleeing from police by car.
McAuliffe’s office excused the mistakes by saying that it was “obviously a massive administrative undertaking” and that it was “working constantly to refine the working administrative database that we’re using to implement this process.”
The mistakes led Republicans tobashthe order as “reckless,” but McAuliffe shielded the order from oversight by keeping the list of felons confidential anddenyingVirginia Freedom of Information Act requests despite guidance from the state’s official FOIA council.
McAuliffe’s attempt to restore all 206,000 individuals’ rights with one order was stopped by Virginia’s supreme court, but hecircumventedtheir ruling by giving clemency to 13,000 individuals on a case-by-case basis.
A Republican leader in the legislature responded to McAuliffe’s Thursday rejection bystatingthat he has observed for years “how hard Virginia Democrats work to protect the maximum potential for voter fraud.”
The White House has stated the goal of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity is “to increase the American people’s confidence in the integrity of our election systems.”
“The integrity of the vote is a foundation of our democracy; this bipartisan commission will review ways to strengthen that integrity in order to protect and preserve the principle of one person, one vote,” Pencesaidon a call with commission members on Wednesday.
A spokesman for Pencesaysthere was no objection to the request for information from states from any members of the commission, which includes four Democrats.
The commission is scheduled to have its first meeting on July 19.",1
"When an anchor baby announced her attendance at Yale University on the taxpayer’s dime, she decided to rub it in the faces of hard-working Americans by adding that her father is an illegal alien and a welfare leech. However, soon after her smug confession, she heard 3 simple words that immediately wiped the privileged grin off her face.
As the left further promotes and enables lawlessness and amorality, criminals come out of the woodwork to brazenly publicize their villainy without fear of justice. Unfortunately, 8 years under Barack Obama allowed this liberal iniquity to fester with his promises to protect those who despise our nation’s laws and values in exchange for their party loyalty. Now that President Donald Trump has begun cracking down on this anarchy, offenders are beginning to realize that their pilfered privileges are finally in jeopardy.
When second-generation illegal immigrant Viviana Andazola-Marquez was accepted to Yale University in 2014, her privileged status had ultimately peaked. Knowing that she was virtually untouchable thanks to the left’s safeguarding of illegals, Viviana was praised in an op-ed in the New York Times in which she unabashedly boasted of how her father had illegally entered the U. S. as an “undocumented person” who flagrantly used taxpayers for his own lawless lifestyle. Unfortunately, she must’ve forgotten that Obama isn’t in office anymore to thwart authorities from upholding U.S. law.
After bragging about her privilege as the daughter of an illegal alien who leeched off taxpayers for decades, the 21-year-old Yalie was informed that authorities had tracked down her fugitive father and were deporting him for an “order of exclusion” that was filed against Melecio Andazola-Morales in 1997 after he had repeatedly illegally entered the U. S., according to The Daily Caller.
“This month my father and I drove to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Centennial, Colo., for a routine visit. I offered to drive because my dad was too nervous and excited to take the wheel. ‘How long have we waited for this day?’ he asked me. He had been told to come in for a final interview before he could get approved for legal permanent residency,” she wrote for the New York Times in yet another op-ed. “But the meeting turned into a nightmare. Several hours after we arrived, I found myself alone, in disbelief. My dad had been detained and was facing deportation proceedings.”
While trying to make herself and her criminal father seem like victims, Viviana lamented that she “accidentally got her illegal alien father detained” when she went with him to try to help him manipulate our justice system. Viviana escorted Melecio to a hasty interview with U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, believing they could obtain a green card after he had squatted illegally in the U.S. since 1988. Their plan to cheat the legal system ultimately failed when her father’s attorney interrupted the meeting to tell them that because of his criminal history, he would not only be denied a green card but extradited in accordance with the 20-year-old order of exclusion.
“My dad wanted to follow the rules. He has been trying to adjust his status with the help of relatives since 2001. We filed the correct paperwork, paid the fees and lined up all his references, only for my dad to be dragged out of a little office and locked up. ICE could have chosen to grant my dad his residency, per the suggestion of our immigration officer. Instead, my father, a man who has filed his taxes every year, has no criminal record and is the sole provider for four children, wasn’t even put out on monitor or bond. He is still being held in a detention center in Aurora, Colo., and is awaiting deportation proceedings unless ICE grants him the cancellation of his removal,” she wrote.
Of course, Viviana lied about her father’s “criminal record” in order to paint him as a victim of Trump’s allegedly racist and tyrannical reign. What she cleverly omits is that her father was already deported once in 1998 only for him to once again illegally enter the U. S. undetected and live on taxpayer-funded benefits, which provided a privileged path for her free ride to an Ivy League school.
The truth is that Melecio didn’t want to “follow the rules,” as Viviana claims. In fact, he defied and broke U. S. laws time and time again. However, the most infuriating aspect of Melecio’s lengthy illegal residence in the U.S. is summed up by Viviana’s description of his and her family’s “struggle and oppression.”
“My father is undocumented but has lived in the United States since 1998. He has raised four children, all American citizens, on income from construction work. He pays his taxes and plays by the rules. He himself has been a perfect citizen — although, of course, he can’t call himself that,” she wrote. “Regardless of his status, he has earned the right to work hard without the constant anxiety of being apprehended. His children — of whom I am the oldest — deserve that peace of mind too.”
While she and her family take advantage of burdened taxpayers, flout our nation’s laws, and mock immigrants who admirably go through the citizenship process legally, Viviana also expresses a racist mentality about the white Americans from which her family sponges.
“Unlearning oppressive ideology and behavior is a responsibility that must be assumed by everyone, especially those whose existence is not threatened by the recent displays of white extremism. Someone did the labor of compiling this list of helpful reads that can assist in the unlearning process, and now it’s up to you to critically engage with these texts and ask yourself why you have not been more engaged, and why you continue to be silent,” she wrote on Facebook.
Viviana claims that her father has lived in the U. S. since 1998, despite his 2 prior illegal entries in 1988 and 1997. Additionally, her own confession that “he pays his taxes and plays by the rules” is spitting in the face of hard-working, tax-paying American citizens. While many Illegal aliens do not pay income tax, the ones who do actually pay far less than the average American citizens and obtain more in government benefits paid by and reserved for American citizens. The deficit illegal immigrants leave even after paying taxes is absolutely crippling.
In the least, Viviana’s public education alone has cost the taxpayers over $147,000 for grades first through twelveth and likely more than $65,000 per year at Yale. Of course, this lowball estimate doesn’t include healthcare, direct benefits, means-tested welfare benefits, or other public services that her struggling, low-income father-of-4 was granted, according to her tearful testimony. In fact, as of 2010, the average illegal immigrant household received $24,721 in government benefits and services.
If amnesty is granted as Viviana desires, her father alone would receive an additional $592,000 in government benefits over the course of his remaining life. Furthermore, the approximately 3.7 million illegal aliens living in the U. S., which is an unquestionably low figure, imposes a net fiscal burden of around $54.5 billion per year on taxpayers. Of course, after amnesty, this number would skyrocket.
Viviana wants her readers to believe that her father had no choice but to repeatedly break our nation’s laws and, at the same time, should be considered a legal citizen. She paints a blurry portrait that depicts her father as a victim when, in reality, he victimized taxpayers. Additionally, Viviana has adopted her father’s entitlement, believing whole-heartedly that she deserves special privilege, which undoubtedly includes minority scholarships, which aren’t available to but are ironically paid for by white legal citizens.",1

Seems like the Trump Bump is on a record roll as the March job’s numbers show the best growth yet, beating expectations.
The United States created 98,000 jobs in March, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.5 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.
January and February were revised downward. Service sector job creation was weak, while manufacturing and construction came in close to expectations.
Job creation fell short of the 180,000 jobs forecast by economists surveyed by Reuters. Economists had expected job creation to fall in March, as unseasonably stormy weather lashed the Northeast during that month
This is what happens when you actually try to keep jobs through proper negotiations and policy’s.

"A new bill has been introduced on the floor of the US Senate that will allow the Feds to seize people’s Bitcoin accounts through “Civil Asset Forfeiture.”
The bill, entitled“Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017,” is aimed at regulating and centralising cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.
Among the bill’s sweeping provisions, the government aims to greatly extend its authority to seize your assets through “Civil Asset Forfeiture”.
Civil Asset Forfeiture rules allow the government to take whatever they want from you, without a trial or any due process.
This new bill adds a laundry list of offenses for which they can legally seize your assets… all of which pertain to money laundering and other financial crimes.
Here’s the thing, though: they’ve also vastly expanded on the definition of such ‘financial crimes’, including failure to fill out a form if you happen to be transporting more than $10,000 worth of ‘monetary instruments’.
Have too much cash? You’d better tell the government.
If not, they’re authorizing themselves in this bill to seize not just the money you didn’t report, but ALL of your assets and bank accounts.
They even go so far as to specifically name “safety deposit boxes” among the various assets that they can seize if you don’t fill out the form.
This is unbelievable on so many levels.
It’s crazy to begin with that these people are so consumed by the fact that someone has $10,000 in cash.
But it’s even crazier that they’re threatening to take EVERYTHING that you own merely for not filling out a piece of paper, without any due process whatsoever.
Oh, and on top of civil asset forfeiture penalties, there are also criminal penalties.
Right now according to current law they can imprison you for up to FIVE YEARS for not filling out the form. Five years.
But apparently that doesn’t go far enough to protect us against evil men in caves.
So this bill aims to double the criminal penalty to TEN years in prison.
And if that weren’t enough, this bill also gives them with new authority to engage in surveillance and wiretapping (including phone, email, etc.) if they have even a hint of suspicion that you might be transporting excess ‘monetary instruments’.
Usually wiretapping authority is reserved for major crimes like kidnapping, human trafficking, felony fraud, etc.
Now we can add cash to that list.
It’s not just government spy agencies to worry about, either.
Banks in the US are already unpaid government spies, required by law to fill out suspicious activity reports on their customers.
Then Congress started expanding those requirements to include other businesses and industries that might come into contact with cash.
According to the law (section 5312 of US Code Title 31), those industries are also required to spy on their customers for the government.
But under this new bill, they want to forcibly recruit even more unpaid spies, including any business which issues or redeems ANYTHING that’s prepaid.
So, Amazon.com, which issues and redeems prepaid gift cards, will be required under this bill to file reports to the government.
For that matter, TGI Fridays and Chuckee Cheese will also become unpaid government spies since they both issue and redeem prepaid vouchers.
Truly these Senators have figured out how to strike at the heart of ISIS.
Further, their bill wants to pull any business which “issues” cryptocurrency under the anti-money laundering regulatory umbrella.
Here’s where these people demonstrate that they have no idea what they’re talking about.
No one “issues” Bitcoin. There’s no Bitcoin central bank. There’s no Chairman of Bitcoin who decides on a whim to increase the supply.
Bitcoin is created automatically amounts that are pre-determined by its code. It’s software.
So the Senate is essentially trying to force the Bitcoin core software to comply with money laundering regulations.
The bill also attempts to drop a major bomb on Bitcoin by including it in the list of monetary instruments that must be reported when entering or leaving the US.
So theoretically if you leave the US with more than $10,000 in Bitcoin or Ether, you’d have to confess this fact to the authorities or otherwise face the aforementioned penalties, i.e. prison time, civil asset forfeiture, etc.
As Smaulgold.com’s Louis Cammarosano explains, the bill contains a provision that would require the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Commissioner of U. S. Customs and Border Protection to devise a “border protection strategy to interdict and detect prepaid access devices, digital currencies, or other similar instruments, at border crossings and other ports of entry for the United States, including an assessment of infrastructure needed [emphasis added] to carry out the strategy.”
The respective Secretary and Commissioner would present their findings to Congress no later than 18 months after passage of the bill.
The obligation to declare amounts in any form over $10,000 exists, irrespective of whether custom officials have a way of detecting such holdings. Since digital currencies technically travel with the holder where ever the holder goes, one would have to declare one’s entire crypto portfolio each time the holder entered the U. S.
Such a declaration is not required for travelers who may happen to have bank accounts or precious metals worth more than $10,000 stored outside the United States.
The type of infrastructure required to detect foreign holdings may come in the form of (i) expanding Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act to currently unregulated foreign crypto currency exchanges and to non U. S. citizens. FATCA currently only applies to U.S account holders of certain foreign financial and non financial institutions; (ii) some type of global monitoring of blockchain activity; or (iii) extreme vetting at the border and penalties for non disclosure that would encourage full disclosure.
As you can see, this bill criminalizes or delegitimizes the most mundane and harmless financial activities, all under the guise of keeping us safe.
Of course nothing in this bill is about keeping people safe.
ISIS couldn’t care less about forms and penalties.
This bill is nothing more than another weapon in their ongoing War on Cash… and now cryptocurrency too.",1
"The unprecedented flow of cash into the Virginia attorney general’s race this fall is being fueled by a group that promotes conservative judges, pro- and anti-gun-control organizations and a billionaire whose 5-Hour Energy drink is facing multiple lawsuits from attorneys general in other states over allegedly deceptive advertising.
Incumbent Mark R. Herring (D) and Republican John Adams are virtually tied in fundraising in the final days before Tuesday’s election with about $9 million each, more than twice as much as was spent in the 2013 contest.
The money is paying for a flurry of negative advertising in the politically polarized contest and, analysts say, illustrates the extent to which outside groups are trying to influence the only attorney general’s race in the nation this year — ahead of 31 attorney general contests in other states in 2018.
Campaign donations “influence the officeholders’ choices whether they know it or not,” said Geoffrey Skelley of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “Not every donation is a quid pro quo, but you are probably going to listen to those donors a little more when big issues come up.”
The Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) and the Democratic Attorneys General Association (DAGA) in past years have not donated to candidates in contests that feature an incumbent, like Herring. This year, however, the Republican group abandoned that posture and the Democratic group quickly followed suit.
The organizations became the top fundraisers for each campaign, funneling money given to them by individuals, businesses and advocacy groups. RAGA has donated $6.7million to Adams this year, according to state and federal reports tracked by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project; DAGA has given Herring $2.3million, plus $400,000 in in-kind donations.
The change in the Republicans’ donation policy came after several Democratic attorneys general, including Herring, began aggressively challenging President Trump’s policies in court. Many Republican attorneys general, who had previously challenged Obama administration proposals, have filed legal briefs supporting Trump’s positions.
“Party committees have a clear mission: Win races,” said Zack Roday, RAGA’s communications director. “RAGA decided earlier this year not to leave winnable races on the table.”
As if to demonstrate the ongoing policy battles, Herring announced Thursday that his office has joined California, Delaware, Maryland and New York in suing over the Trump administration’s recent decision to expand the rights of employers to deny women insurance coverage for contraception. Adams had argued twice in lawsuits for the rights of employers to refuse to provide birth-control coverage based on the employers’ religious beliefs.
Mark Rozell, the dean of George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government, said the attorney general’s race — which has drawn far less interest from the public than Virginia’s heated gubernatorial contest — may be on the radar screens of interest groups for reasons that go beyond specific policy disputes.
“The down-ticket races are of such consequence to these donors because the election winners are likely to be gubernatorial candidates in four years,” Rozell said.
The biggest single contributor to either attorney general candidate is the Judicial Crisis Network, perhaps best known for its efforts last year to block President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. The group sent $2.35million to RAGA in 2017, according to the association’s report to the Internal Revenue Service. Second was the National Rifle Association, which gave RAGA $775,000. ETC Capital, an investment fund in Farmington Hills, Mich., whose founder owns 5-Hour Energy, donated $500,000 to RAGA.
[In Va., nationwide, GOP using ‘sanctuary cities’ as a weapon against Democrats ]
The Democratic association has reported donors only from the first half of 2017 to the IRS. It will file its report from the second half in early 2018.
In the first six months of the year, DAGA’s biggest contributions were about $75,000 from the United Food and Commercial Workers union and just over $60,000 from T-Mobile.
Since June 30, DAGA communications director Lizzie Ulmer said, some of the top donors have been Planned Parenthood, the National Education Association and Citigroup.
One Commonwealth, Herring’s own leadership political action committee, gave $827,500 directly to Herring’s campaign, making it his second-biggest donor after DAGA. The next biggest is Everytown for Gun Safety, which gave $600,000 through the end of October. One of that group’s founders is former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.
The Judicial Crisis Network’s chief counsel and policy director, Carrie Severino, did not respond to a question about Adams but said RAGA has had “enormous positive impact on our public policy landscape by supporting attorneys general who fight for the rule of law and the constitutional principles that protect every American.”
The network poured more than $2 million into Michigan court elections in 2012 and another $2 million to groups involved in 2014 judicial elections, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
The Fairfax-based NRA gave Adams a top rating and created an anti-Herring television ad that accused the Democrat of taking away “the rights of gun owners to protect themselves” — a reference to Herring’s decision to stop recognizing out-of-state concealed-carry permits, later reversed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D).
[Gillespie criticized by fellow Republicans for abandoning his big-tent approach]
ETC Capital, which gave the third-largest amount to RAGA, was founded by Manoj Bhargava. He also founded Innovation Ventures and Living Essentials, companies that sell 5-Hour Energy and came under Food and Drug Administration scrutiny after 13 deaths were linked to the supplement. In addition, five attorneys general have sued over alleged deceptive marketing practices for the product, charges that the companies deny.
A Washington state court judge earlier this year ruled largely in favor of the state attorney general and ordered the company to pay $4.3million. Judges in Oregon and Indiana ruled in favor of the company. Cases are pending in Vermont and Hawaii.
Bhargava has given millions to candidates for state office and political groups since 2009, the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity reported in 2015. Douglas Graham, former vetting adviser for political conflicts of interest at the Obama White House and now the managing director of a Washington risk advisory and corporate investigation firm, called such contributions “not your typical political donations.”
When a firm under investigation donates to those seeking to become a state’s top prosecutor, even in other jurisdictions, Graham said, it “definitely erodes the public’s confidence that justice will prevail.”
ETC Capital, Living Essentials and Innovation Ventures did not respond to requests for comment.
Herring’s direct donors include gun-control groups, labor unions, Planned Parenthood, educators and conservationists, according to filings compiled by the Virginia Public Access Project. Adams’s donor list is full of attorneys, developers, manufacturers, and energy and financial services executives or employees.
Herring has about 13 times the number of donations under $100 than Adams has, raising a total of $350,109 from 13,435 small donors, compared with $63,013 from 1,030 small donors to Adams, VPAP reports show. About 29percent of Adams’s donations over $100 come from Virginia-based people or groups; about 40percent of Herring’s donations that size are from the commonwealth.
Campaigns are not required to report the names and locations of donors who give less than $100.",0
"The claim: Changes to stamp duty will save an average of 1,700 to first-time buyers.
Reality Check verdict: The average first-time buyer would indeed save about 1,700 in stamp duty, but for some people it's likely that would be more than offset by increased house prices, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides independent assessments of the Budget. It's likely to be better news for potential first-time buyers struggling to get together a deposit than for those unable to borrow enough as a result of their earnings.
Chancellor Philip Hammond has abolished stamp duty on homes costing less than 300,000, with reduced rates up to 500,000.
You can read about the full details of the policy with the variations around the UK here.
A first-time buyer purchasing a 500,000 property, who would previously have paid 15,000 in stamp duty, will now pay 10,000, while someone buying a property for 300,000, who would previously have faced a stamp duty bill of 5,000, will now not pay anything.
The chancellor told BBC News that the average saving for first-time buyers would be 1,700 - that is the amount of stamp duty that would previously have been payable on the average property bought by first-time buyers, according to the Halifax.
But forecasts from the judgement of the OBR suggest that the benefits would come to existing homeowners and not first-time buyers because house prices are likely to rise by 0.3%.
This policy is part of a package of measures designed to help first-time buyers to access the housing market. To understand whether it is a good thing, it is useful to think about two key reasons why people might be struggling to buy houses.
One possibility is that people are struggling to raise enough money for a deposit. Most mortgages require the borrower to put up a minimum proportion of the purchase price - 5% or 10% for example.
If somebody is struggling to get together a deposit, then being able to spend the 5,000 they had earmarked for stamp duty on the deposit instead, for example, will be useful and also may increase the amount they can borrow, which will mean they can buy a property they may not have been able to in other circumstances.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) stressed that while house prices might have risen, this sort of buyer would end up with a more valuable asset, even if only as a result of the new stamp duty policy.
""The price goes up, but the other impact it has is that it allows first-time buyers the ability to purchase properties that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to afford,"" OBR chairman Robert Chote told the BBC's Daily Politics.
Another possibility is that people have saved up their deposit but their earnings are not high enough for a mortgage provider to be prepared to lend them enough money to buy a suitable property.
This policy will not be good for them if house prices rise as the OBR suggested. It said that house prices could go up by twice as much as the stamp duty saving because of the extra borrowing made possible for some people by having a bigger deposit.
The OBR also quoted HMRC's verdict on the similar stamp duty holiday after the financial crisis, which was that it ""has not had a significant impact in terms of improving the affordability of residential property for first-time buyers"".
This point about rising prices was put to the chancellor on the Today programme, but he said this was looking at the stamp duty change in isolation without the effect on the market of the 300,000 net homes per year that the government plans to build in England by the middle of the next decade.
There has been some doubt about the government's ability to achieve this target, not least from the OBR, which has not made any adjustments to its forecasts for housing starts. It said: ""Governments have announced a number of initiatives aimed at overcoming housing supply constraints,"" referring for example to the National Planning Policy Framework from 2012.",0
"(Before It's News)New research has uncovered an added dimension to the decision to inject large amounts of chemical dispersants above the crippled seafloor oil well during the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010.
The dispersants, scientists have found, may have significantly reduced the amount of harmful gases in the air at the sea surface — diminishing health risks for emergency responders and enabling them to keep working to stop the spill and clean it up sooner.
The Gulf of Mexico’s loop current carried oil beyond the site of the disaster.

The results were published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The research team included Jonas Gros, Scott Socolofsky, Anusha Dissanayake and Inok Jun of Texas A&M University; Lin Zhao and Michel Boufadel of the New Jersey Institute of Technology; Christopher Reddy of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; and J. Samuel Arey of the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology.
The study was funded by the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative and the National Science Foundation (NSF).
“In 2010, when NSF began rapid response funding for research on Deepwater Horizon, it was important to characterize the initial conditions of the spill such as plume dynamics and ecological effects,” says Don Rice, a program director in NSF’s Division of Ocean Sciences, which supported the new research. “These scientists and others did just that. As the findings of this study clearly demonstrate, the discoveries of basic scientific research and the practical applications that follow in their wake are often unanticipated.”
In the midst of the Deepwater Horizon crisis, officials made the decision to, over 67 days, inject more than 700,000 gallons of chemical dispersant above the oil rig’s severed wellhead at the bottom of the gulf.
The aim was to break the petroleum into smaller droplets in the deep sea to diminish oil slicks and reduce the amount of harmful gases rising to the ocean surface.

The new study demonstrates a beneficial effect of the dispersants: The subsea dispersant injection may have allowed emergency responders to literally breathe easier.
By breaking petroleum into smaller droplets that dissolved faster in the deep ocean, the dispersants decreased the amounts of volatile toxic compounds that rose to the surface and into the air.
This process improved air quality for the responders and likely reduced the number of days when responders were forced to don respirators or suspend cleanup efforts.
Dispersants have been applied to oil slicks on the ocean surface for half a century to break petroleum into smaller droplets that dissipate and to keep oil from reaching ecologically sensitive coastlines.
But they had never been used at the unprecedented depth of 5,000 feet beneath the surface, where an estimated 7,500 tons per day of oil and 2,400 tons per day of natural gas were jetting from the ruptured wellhead.
That flow rate is equivalent to 57,000 barrels per day of oil and 92 million cubic feet per day of gas at the sea surface.
During the period studied, an inverted funnel, or “top hat,” that was placed directly above the wellhead prevented 19,000 barrels per day of oil from escaping into the sea.
In the new study, the scientists built and tested a mathematical model that simulated the complex chemical and physical interactions among water, oil, gas and dispersant during Deepwater Horizon.
The researchers focused on the period starting June 3, 2010, when engineers cut the riser pipe at the wellhead, through July 15, 2010, a timespan when a large number of scientific observations were collected nearby in the air and ocean.
To test the model’s ability to simulate the real-world disaster, the scientists compared its predictions to these observations.
Nearly all the comparisons aligned with the model’s output, indicating that the model replicated many aspects of what happened to the oil and gas under the ocean surface.
The team then ran the model to see what would have happened if dispersants had not been injected above the wellhead during the same time period.
The results indicated the deep-sea dispersant injection did have a profound effect on air quality at the ocean surface.

The injection of the subsea dispersant caused the turbulent jet of petroleum fluids to form oil droplets that were about 30 times smaller by volume than they would have been without dispersants.
This subtle change caused many volatile petroleum chemicals to dissolve more rapidly. Most of the highly toxic benzene and toluene in the oil were transported away in deep currents and likely would have biodegraded within weeks, say the scientists.
The dispersant injection, according to the model, decreased the overall concentration of all volatile organic chemicals in the atmosphere by a modest amount, about 30 percent.
But it also significantly reduced the amount of chemicals most harmful to humans, such as benzene and toluene. The atmospheric concentration of benzene, for example, decreased by about 6,000 times, dramatically improving air quality.
Without the dispersant injection, the model showed that benzene concentrations in the air 2 meters above the sea surface would have been 13 times higher than the levels considered acceptable to breathe during a 10-hour working day or a 40-hour work week, based on guidelines by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.
However, with the dispersant injection, the model showed that atmospheric benzene concentrations were 500 times lower than the levels considered acceptable to breathe.
The researchers believe that clean-up delays would have been more frequent if the subsurface dispersant injection had not been applied.",1

"Having spent years without a place to call home besides the streets, Clem Smith experienced what must have been a bittersweet windfall, when his mother bequeathed $214,000 in a will upon her passing — facilitating the purchase of property and stability in the future with the completion of a house he planned to construct.
In the interim, Smith allotted part of that inheritance to stock his new Conifer, Colorado, property with a used car, an older front-end loader, dump truck, shipping container, chicken coop — complete with four hens — and an RV, intended as housing only until construction of the home is complete.
“Of the $214,000 inheritance,” reports local ABC affiliate, Denver7, Smith “spent $125,000 for the property and put the rest into improvements for a power connection, water well, septic drawings, septic engineering and road engineering.”
In her passing, Smith’s mother bestowed the one thing her son hadn’t felt in over six years: security.
This seemingly impossible dream — a physical address at the place where he looked forward to growing old — abruptly metamorphosed into reality.
But it was tragically and avoidably ephemeral.
An irritated neighbor reported the RV, shipping container, and refuse on the property, for which Smith received code violation citations — under the premise those items were being stored on otherwise vacant land, and that others would be allowed to stay and live in the shipping container.
Smith vehemently denies the latter allegation, telling Denver7, “I believe the person that complained came in (the shipping container) and saw a dresser and thought people were going to try to live here.”
That dresser serves as a storage container and workbench, he asserts, used for construction and other planning.
“Jeanie Rossillon, Jefferson County’s director of development and transportation, said that under existing code, the RV is considered an accessory and cannot be parked on the property without a house. Ditto for the shipping container,” Denver7 notes.
To the property owner, it isn’t the time frame, but the fact he’s actively building the home — himself — as quickly as he’s able, and harbors no designs to live in the camper permanently. But the county insists he move the two items off the property — at his now-limited expense — or be fined $500 to $1,000, with potential additional repercussions down the road.
If he leaves with the RV, Smith would have to avail himself of a Walmart parking lot, making a commute — to the property he owns to work on the house — a gas-guzzling arduous affair.
“I don’t think it’s fair,” he opined. “I’ve been on the homeless circuit for several years and everybody at the campgrounds and at Walmart, is hoping to get a piece of property and build their own home.”
All frugality notwithstanding, the inheritance has already dwindled — Smith worries the nitpicky strictures will ultimately force him back onto the streets, despite the dream being palpable.
Rossillon cited typical bureaucratic rhetoric pertaining to code enforcement — health, safety, and welfare — in coldly affirming the county’s position.
“It’s also about expectations and balancing everyone’s property rights,” she added, alluding to the unnamed neighbor who reported the violations as well as something vague about hippies in schoolbuses camped on nearby mountains in the 1970s — while failing to elaborate on Smith’s unique predicament — much less, the violation of his property rights.
“I own this property,” Smith, despondent and emotional, told Denver7. “I paid for it in cash. It’s all mine. I should be able to live on it for a certain amount of time, while I’m surveying, engineering or planning.”
He added, “I shouldn’t have to pay a fine, I’m not a criminal.”
Having his ultimate dream within reach for such a fleeting time — and facing extraordinary callousness from the inflexible State, due only to a neighbor’s upturned nose at the activity Smith undertook on property he owns — has filled the man with anxiety and despair.
Worse, the ludicrous turn of events threatens to rob Smith of the most cherished gift his mother’s estate offered: security.
No state — Colorado, here’s lookin’ at you — can describe itself as compassionate, even one iota, on the issue of homelessness, and then place obstacles this mountainous in the path of those doing their best to overcome the problem.

"News 8 – A ‘second sun’ continues to baffle scientists as Astronomy Observatory WebCams, along with NASA’s own satellite photos, are recording this epic, never before seen occurrence. Several people have also captured this beautiful double sun in the sky with their own cameras, submitting them to media outlets across the country.
Until now, NASA has denied in public statements that this ‘second sun’ exists. Now, they are saying it does exist, but poses no threat. If so, why is NASA warning their own staff to make preparations for a possible collision? The Pacific Northwest Regional Observatory employee leaked this bone chilling statement: “This ‘second sun’ which they are calling ‘GTY421’, is approaching Earth at a rapid speed of 345,000 miles per hour. This is an increase compared to last week’s speed calculated at 185,000 miles per hour. NASA has warned its employees in a confidential, in-house memo to prepare for the worst. They want to keep this information out of the hands of the public because they fear mass chaos if this information was leaked. I am coming forward with this information, because I think the world has the right to know. ETA of impact – September 28 between 8 AM and 10 AM PST.”
Several people have captured this double sun with their cell phone recorders as shown in the video below.
NASA has not released any public statement concerning the accusations of the observatory employee. We will keep you updated with any new developments.",1
"Sri Lanka's president said his country has defeated the Tamil Tiger rebels on the battlefield and emerged victorious from its quarter-century civil war as troops seized control of the island's entire coastline for the first time in decades.
Fighting continued to rage in the war zone along the northeast coast and huge explosions could be heard across the battlefield as rebels detonated their ammunition stocks and artillery dumps, military spokesman Brig. Udaya Nanayakkara said.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam had been vanquished.
""My government, with the total commitment of our armed forces, has in an unprecedented humanitarian operation finally defeated the LTTE militarily,"" Rajapaksa said.
""I will be going back to a country that has been totally freed from the barbaric acts of the LTTE,"" he said in a speech at an international gathering in Jordan that was distributed to the media in Sri Lanka.
On Saturday morning, soldiers took control of the coastline, sealing the Tamil Tigers in a tiny pocket of territory and cutting off the possibility of a sea escape by the rebels' top leaders, the military said.
Two senior rebel fighters known only by their noms de guerre, Sornam and Sasi Master, were killed in Saturday's fighting, Nanayakkara said.
The rebels, who once ran a de facto state across the north, had controlled a formidable navy and sea smuggling operation.
Thousands of civilians fled intense shelling in the 1.2-square mile patch of land still under rebel control. Nearly 25,000 civilians have fled since Thursday, Nanayakkara said.
Government forces have been hunting for the reclusive Tamil Tiger leader Prabhakaran and his top deputies for months, but it was unclear if they remained in rebel territory or had already fled overseas.
On the verge of battlefield defeat, the rebels reiterated their calls for the government to cease its offensive and restart talks to resolve the long-standing ethnic conflict between the minority Tamils and the Sinhalese majority.
Selvarasa Pathmanathan, in charge of the rebels' international relations department, said the group welcomed President Barack Obama's call Wednesday for a peaceful end to the conflict and would do ""anything that is necessary"" to spare the civilians. However, he did not specifically say whether the rebels would accede to Obama's request to lay down their arms and surrender.
Reports of the fighting are difficult to verify because the government has barred most journalists and aid workers from the conflict zone.
The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for a separate state for minority Tamils after decades of marginalization by the Sinhalese majority. The group, responsible for hundreds of suicide attacks, has been branded a terror organization by the U. S., E.U. and India.
The rebels also controlled a conventional army as well, with artillery units, a significant navy and even a tiny air force.
After repeated stalemates on the battlefield, the military broke through the rebel lines last year and slowly forced the insurgents into a broad retreat. The government captured the rebel's administrative capital at Kilinochchi in January and vowed to swiftly crush the group.
Meanwhile, international concern has grown for the tens of thousands of civilians still trapped in the war zone amid the unrelenting artillery bombardments, and the Red Cross has warned of ""an unimaginable humanitarian catastrophe"" for the hundreds of wounded trapped without treatment.
The government has brushed off repeated calls from foreign diplomats for a humanitarian truce in the conflict, saying it would only give the reeling rebels time to regroup.
The U. N. says 7,000 civilians were killed and 16,700 wounded in the fighting from Jan. 20 through May 7, according to a U.N. document given to The Associated Press by a senior diplomat.
Since then, doctors in the war zone say more than 1,000 civilians have been killed in a week of heavy shelling that rights groups and foreign governments have blamed on Sri Lankan forces. The government denies firing heavy weapons into the war zone.
Some 11,800 civilians escaped the war zone Saturday, Nanayakkara said. They joined more than 200,000 others who escaped in recent months and are being held in displacement camps.
U. N. spokesman Gordon Weiss said an estimated 20,000 people had emerged from the combat zone in the past few days and were being processed by the government.
""We have no access to that process. We hold grave fears for the safety of the estimated 30,000 to 80,000 people who are still inside the combat zone,"" he said.
""We are particularly concerned for the safety of two doctors - Drs. Varatharajah and Sathyamurthi - who courageously kept the medical services going throughout the months of the siege of the combat zone.""
The pair ran a badly understaffed makeshift hospital in the war zone that was repeatedly shelled and overwhelmed with hundreds of casualties from the fighting nearly every day.
The navy intercepted a boat off the northeastern coast Friday and arrested the wife, son and daughter of the rebels' sea wing leader, who were among 11 people on board, Nanayakkara said.

"Anarticlein Muckrock reveals that the California Department of Justice (CDOJ) is using facial recognition cameras to spy on everyone.
The CDOJ spent close to one million dollars ($850K) to install NEC’s NeoFace system everywhere.
According to the article, the CDOJ has been spying on everyone since April 26th., 2016.
What’s even worse is the CDOJ is paying NEC $650,000 every year in ‘support fees’. Which means Calif. taxpayers are paying $650K a year for the privilege of being spied on.
Is it a coincidence that NEC opened up aBiometric Center for Excellencein California and another one in Washington, DC?
California and the NEC call their new system theIntegrated Criminal Justice Image System(ICJIS) which is actually run by DHS Fusion Centers!
“The Federal Department of Homeland Security is providing funding to states and localities to help support these Fusion Centers, which are equipped withsurveillance,communications, and information technology systems…”
According topage 8of NEC’s, ICJIS document, when the contractors were finished with the installation they had to destroy all evidence(documents) of their collaboration with the CDOJ.
In other words, the DOJ is covering their tracks and doesn’t want the public to know how widespread their facial recognition surveillance system really is. (To find out more about the DOJ lying to Congress clickhere,here&here.)
If the DOJ and police are willing to lie about facial recognition, has the Bill of Rights become a joke?
Page 24of ICJS document reveals, their cameras are capable of identifying people in real-time.
It’s also troubling to discover, that just about anyone can use these cameras to identify the public without a warrant.Page 27reveals how law enforcement partners and public safety agencies have access to the cameras.
Page 27 also reveals that facial recognition cameras have the ability to track, watch or flag people.
And pages 33 & 34 reveal how the CDOJ uses theNational Institute of Standard and Technologyand theAmerican National Standard for Information Standardsto help them spy on everyone.
The state of Pennsylvania also uses NEC’s,JNET Facial Recognition Solutionto identify everyone.
“The system serves more than 800 contributing law enforcement and other state offices in Pennsylvania and includes more than 250 capture locations, more than 2.5 million arrest records, and 38,000 web retrieval users sharing data records and mug shot images across the state’s WAN.”(For more information about JNET clickhere&here.)
The Feds, are using corporations to spy on everyone, what’s wrong with this picture?
Courthouses, DMV’s, Social Services etc., to be equipped with facial recognition cameras
“Law enforcement, public safety, courts, corrections, probations, parole, DAs and public defenders, and even agencies like the DMV, Labor, Business Licensing and, Human and Social Services, are involved in criminal justice integration systems (CJIS) projects and are leveraging our tools to share data in real time.”
Two years ago, the Carnahan Courthouse in St. Louis began using police run facial recognition cameras to identify everyone.
“A group of current and retired St. Louis police officers developed the technology over eight years and recently formed a company, Blue Line Security Solutions, to market it.”
Court visitors are asked to pause at the gates and take off their hats, glasses or other obstructions, so facial recognition cameras can identify them.
Soon every government agency will have facial recognition cameras, unless we do something now.
Feds claim facial recognition cameras are for their security and safety
The Feds, claim that“face recognition technologies can identify suspects and improve security and officer safety.”
Don’t believe them, facial recognition is all about control, knowing who you are and where you are.
Do you feel safer knowing the government is using corporations to spy on you and your family?
“The integration of real-time face recognition with body-worn cameras is further along than lawmakers and citizens realize.”
“Taser, which leads the market for body cameras, recently acquired two startups that will allow it to run video analytics on the footage the cameras collect, and Taser’s CEO has repeatedly emphasized the development of real-time applications, such as scanning videos for faces, objects, and suspicious activity.”

Security versus privacy: Residents weigh in on cameras on Bourbon Street:
“Perhaps the most dramatic of the proposed security improvements would be the installation of video cameras along Bourbon Street, capable of capturing license plates and tracking suspects…”

"Some things are worth the wait. Nine years in the making, the largest fish and wildlife exhibition in the world is set to open on Sept. 22 in Springfield, Mo., just ahead ofNational Hunting and Fishing Dayon Sept. 23.
The Wonders of Wildlife National Museum & Aquarium was created by Bass Pro Shops founder, Johnny Morris, who envisioned the not-for-profit project as the planet’s greatest tribute to conservation movement.
“Wonders of Wildlife is an inspirational journey around the world that celebrates the role of hunters and anglers as America’s true conservation heroes,” Morris said in press release. “We proudly invite families and sportsmen to come share the wonder with an unforgettable experience meant to inspire generations of future conservationists.”
MAN TRIES TO BARBECUE RATTLESNAKE, GETS BIT ON FACE
Constructed next to Bass Pro Shop’s national headquarters, the sprawling 350,000-square-foot complex is larger in scale and scope than the Smithsonian Museum of National History. Filled with over 35,000 animals, the two-part attraction features a 1.5 million gallons of salt and freshwater aquariums on one side, and over 1.5 miles of immersive habitat trails on the other,Fox 4said. Gallery highlights include a two-story Shipwreck Room, African savannah, Amazon rainforest, plus exhibits on the Arctic and American National Parks.
Not surprisingly, the mesmerizing museum took an army of staffers to produce: Morris partnered with over 40 different conservation organizations and hired over 2,000 artisans, scientists and engineers to make Wonders of Wildlife reality. According to theirwebsite, the combo ticket for access to both the aquarium and wildlife galleries is $23.95 for children ages 4 to 11 and $39.95 for adults. With the exception of Christmas, it will be open daily.
PIONEER WOMAN REE DRUMMOND IS OPENING A HOTEL NEXT TO THE MERCANTILE
To commemorate its grand opening, on Sept. 20, Wonders of Wildlife hosted a massive gala, attended by 3,000, to honor prominent North American conservation leaders. The star-studded event was attended by President George W. Bush, President Jimmy Carter, and U. S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke. Music stars including Luke Bryan and Dierks Bentley gave a special performance.
Created by Congress in 1972,National Hunting and Fishing Day has been celebrated the fourth Saturday of every September to promote the importance of wildlife, aquatic and open space preservation as well as outdoor recreation in the U. S. Further, the nation’s passion for great outdoors is serious business. According to the latest report from theU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 101.6 million Americans ages 16 and older participated in wildlife-related activities like hunting, fishing, and wildlife-watching last year, spending around $156 billion.

"The increasing use of surveillance technology – including body-worn video, drones and number plate recognition systems – risks changing the “psyche of the community” by reducing individuals to trackable numbers in a database, the government’s CCTV watchdog has warned.
In his full first interview as surveillance commissioner, Tony Porter – a former senior counter-terrorism officer – said the public was complacent about encroaching surveillance and urged public bodies, including the police, to be more transparent about how they are increasingly using smart cameras to monitor people.
Porter stressed that he was not anti-surveillance and insisted he was helping to improve standards by encouraging the adoption of a voluntary code. But he added: “The lack of public awareness about the nature of surveillance troubles me.”
Porter, who was appointed to the independent role in March, is responsible for overseeing around 100,000 publicly operated CCTV cameras out of total of up to 6m surveillance cameras nationwide. He said: “When people say ‘the public love CCTV’, do they really know what it does and its capability? Do they know with advancing technology, and algorithms, it starts to predict behaviour?”

"The Mustang is getting a makeover.
Hot on the heels of the debut of the 2018 F-150 at the Detroit Auto Show, Ford has revealed an updated version of its other iconic model.
The 2018 Mustang sports a refreshed exterior design, with a lower, sleeker hood and squinty new LED headlights. Inside, buyers can now opt for a 12-inch-wide full digital instrument cluster to bring its retro-inspired cabin further into the 21st century.
The Mustang’s entry-level V6 has been dropped in favor of a two-engine lineup that includes a torquier version of the current 2.3-liter turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder and a new 5.0-liter V8. The V8 features Ford’s “dual-fuel” port and direct fuel injection system -- already in use on several of its turbocharged motors – that helps it rev higher and produce more efficient power than the 5.0-liter it replaces, which is rated at 435 hp. An optional dual-mode exhaust system for the V8 will let you pump up the volume of all those ponies galloping out of the pipes.
Both engines can be had with a 10-speed automatic transmission shared with the F-150, but don’t worry, do-it-yourself diehards, because a re-engineered six-speed manual will still be standard equipment. New gearing gives the stick a direct drive fourth gear and two overdrives for improved fuel economy.
There’s no word yet if the Shelby GT350 will get the snazzy new styling, or even continue into 2018, but its adjustable MagneRide active dampers will now be available on all Mustangs equipped with the Performance Pack. Even without it, the suspension has been updated for better ride control and handling across the model lineup. The base setup on all models is essentially the same as the outgoing model's Performance Pack.
Adaptive radar cruise control returns, plus a new camera-based lane-keeping assist and pedestrian-detecting automatic braking system.
Ford sold 105,000 Mustangs in the U. S. in 2016, making it the best-selling sports car ahead of its arch-rival, the Chevrolet Camaro, by about 30,000 cars. Pricing for the 2018 Mustang has not been announced, but it goes on sale in the fall.",0
"From 1999 to 2015, while America was grappling with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the worst economic crisis since the Depression, another tragedy quietly unfolded — the death rate of teenagers overdosing on drugs more than doubled.
In 2015 alone, there were 772 drug overdose deaths for adolescents ages 15 through 19 and they died at a rate of 3.7 per 100,000, according to figures newly released Wednesday from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
By contrast, the death rate was 1.6 per 100,000 in 1999.
“For both male and female adolescents, the majority of drug overdose deaths in 2015 were unintentional,” the CDC report states.
And the chief culprits that year were the same drugs that the National Institute on Drug Abuse say killed a total 35,000 Americans of all ages across the country — opiods, specifically heroin.
""Drug deaths are rising very rapidly for this group (although not as fast as at slightly older ages) and opioid analgesics and particularly heroin and fentanyl are the most important contributors,"" Dr. Christopher Ruhm, author of a recent University of Virginia study which found the national overdose crisis may be even worse than reported, wrote in an email to NBC News.
Ruhm said he expects the death toll for 15- to 19-year-olds will likely be higher after the CDC compiles its figures for 2016 and 2017.
""Not, primarily, because of opioid analgesics but rather because of rapid growth in deaths due to heroin and (often unintentionally) fentanyl use,"" he wrote. ""Prescription opioids have played a role in all of this earlier, particularly in establishing patterns that led to increased heroin use.""
In response to growing demands for action, President Donald Trump this month declared a national emergency. But this is a crisis that was brewing long before he took office in January.
In 1999, the last full year of President Bill Clinton’s term, the death rate due to drug overdoses for this age group was 1.6 per 100,000, according to the CDC.
By 2007, which was more than midway through President George W. Bush’s second tumultuous term in the White House, it had climbed to 4.2 per 100,000, the agency reported.
Then from 2007 through 2014, when the Bush gave way to President Barack Obama, the death rate declined — especially among young men — by 26 percent to 3.1 per 100,000, the figures show.
The death rate then climbed to 3.7 per 100,000 in 2015, the second to last year of Obama’s second term.
The rise in overdose deaths has been blamed on pharmaceutical companies flooding the marketplace with prescription painkillers.
Several states are suing Big Pharma, including hard-hit Ohio, which accused five companies in particular of “borrowing a page from Big Tobacco’s playbook” and downplaying the risks of using powerful drugs like OxyContin and Percocet.
By minimizing the risk of addiction, they helped create “a population of patients physically and psychologically dependent on them,” the Ohio suit states. “And when those patients can no longer afford or legitimately obtain opioids, they often turn to the street to buy prescription opioids or even heroin.”",0

"Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST)’s energy drinks have been cited in the deaths of five people in the past year, according to incident reports that doctors and companies submit to the U. S. Food and Drug Administration.
The reports said the victims consumed Monster drinks prior to their deaths, Shelly Burgess, an FDA spokeswoman, said today in a phone interview. The FDA said the incidents, which are voluntarily reported, are considered to be allegations, and no conclusion is drawn until an investigation is completed. Shares of Corona, California-based Monster fell the most since 2008.
The FDA reports are being used by parents in Maryland who sued Monster last week, claiming the drinks led to caffeine toxicity that killed their 14-year-old daughter. Senator Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, is asking the FDA to consider caffeine limits on energy drinks after emergency room visits involving such products jumped 10-fold from 2005 through 2009.
“FDA continues to evaluate the emerging science on a variety of ingredients, including caffeine,” Burgess said in an earlier e-mail.
The five death reports, and a sixth in 2009, were among 37 adverse reaction reports since 2004 that mentioned Monster drinks, according to a log of incidents that health professionals, companies and the public voluntarily recorded with the FDA. The agency has said it’s working on draft guidelines that would ensure energy drinks are safe.
Monster fell 14 percent to $45.73 at the close of New Yorktrading, erasing all the gains the stock had made this year.
The log of adverse incident reports was given to Bloomberg News by Kevin Goldberg, a lawyer representing the parents of the 14-year-old girl who died. The girl, Anais Fournier, had consumed two Monster drinks, according to a copy of the complaint filed Oct. 17 in state court in Riverside, California.
Monster, the largest U. S. energy drink maker by sales volume, sold about $1.6 billion worth of such drinks last year, the majority of company revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its energy drink sales have tripled since 2006.
“Over the past 16 years Monster has sold more than 8 billion energy drinks, which have been safely consumed worldwide,” the company said in an e-mailed statement sent through an outside spokesman, Evan Pondel. “Monster does not believe that its beverages are in any way responsible for the death of Ms. Fournier. Monster is unaware of any fatality anywhere that has been caused by its drinks.”
The company said it intends to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit and won’t comment further.
Emergency room visits involving energy drinks increased to 13,114 in 2009, with about half those trips made by patients 18 to 25 years old and also involving drugs or alcohol, according to a November report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The event reports linked to Monster claimed that some of the life-threatening illnesses were characterized by heart attack, chest pain and vomiting.
The Center for Food Safety Adverse Event Reporting System is used by the public to report illnesses that the user deems to be linked to a particular food, drug or dietary supplement. The claims, which serve as a signal to the FDA, don’t prove causation, Burgess said.
Monster and competitors such as Red Bull aren’t bound by the FDA guidelines for caffeine in sodas, because energy drinks are often sold as dietary supplements. Monster doesn’t list the amount of caffeine in its proprietary formula, only that the ingredient along with the plant extract guarana and the amino acid taurine are in the drink, according to the lawsuit.
Soda typically can have as many as 71 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounces for the FDA to consider it safe. The FDA may require companies to prove caffeine levels are safe if they exceed the guideline. Caffeine in energy drinks often ranges from 160 milligrams to 500 milligrams a serving, the FDA said in an August letter responding to Senator Durbin’s call for greater regulation of the industry.
Regulators are assessing the nation’s caffeine intake to ensure the amount in energy drinks is as safe as that in coffee, soda and tea, the FDA said earlier this year after Durbin raised the issue in April.
The parents of Fournier, the Maryland 14-year-old, are seeking damages in court in excess of $25,000, according to their complaint. The cause of the Dec. 23, 2011, death was“cardiac arrhythmia due to caffeine toxicity,” according to the lawsuit, which cited a state autopsy report. The Maryland medical examiner’s office in Baltimore said the autopsy cited is a valid report, without making any further comment about the legal claims related to the death.
A trial date hasn’t been set, the lawyer said. He said his firm, Goldberg, Finnegan & Mester in Silver Spring, Maryland, is investigating additional cases involving Monster and other energy drink companies.
“Our primary goal is to make sure Monster is aware of what Anais’ mother thinks the drink did to her child,” the lawyer, Goldberg, said in a telephone interview.
“It’s the first wrongful death case involving a minor child against an energy drink company that I’m aware of,” he said.
The case is Wendy Crossland and Richard Fournier v. Monster Beverage Corp., California Superior Court, Riverside County (Riverside).",1
"In a rare public speech Tuesday, Nadav Argaman, the head of Israel's security agency, the Shin Bet, explained how the country has harnessed tech to prevent ""lone-wolf"" terrorist attacks.
Speaking at the Cyber Week cybersecurity conference in Tel Aviv, Argaman explained that tech is proving a key weapon in the country’s fight against terrorism. “Despite the complexity, the Shin Bet, along with its partners, has succeeded, by means of technological, intelligence and operational adjustments, to thwart last year more than 2,000 potential lone wolf terrorists,” he said. “The breakthrough technological advances, along with familiarity with operational space and work, have contributed greatly to reducing the level of terror and our ability to defend against the threat of isolated attacks.""
Argaman described how technology can provide vital intelligence on how attackers operate. “In the cyber arena, we learn the enemy's patterns of action and know how to strike at him in a variety of ways and methods,” he said.
Earlier this month, The Economist reported that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have developed artificial intelligence algorithms to monitor the social media accounts of young Palestinians for early warning signs of potential attackers. This includes “tripwire” terms such as “the sword of Allah” and “day of the sword,” according to The Economist.
The Shin Bet chief also explained how Israel is working with other intelligence bodies. “The Shin Bet maintains working relations with colleagues from intelligence organizations around the world and is ready to assist in the knowledge and experience that have accumulated in the face of the terror threats facing Western countries today,” he said.
Additionally, Argaman described, for the first time, the reorganization underway at the Israel Security Service, with its technology and cyber units rolling into one branch. “The Shin Bet is like an evolving start-up, with unmatched strength,” he said.",0
"Imagine trying to evacuate a tiger, rhino or gorilla—during the throes of a major hurricane.
The panic from such a scenario""can kill these animals,"" who could hatch a desperate plan to escape, causing them to run into things and overheat,said Zoo Miami spokesman Ron Magill.
Unlike household pets accustomed to taking trips, wild animals in a zoo are not used to being moved, he said.
That's why the 330-acre Zoo Miami isn't evacuating any of its 3,000 animals, a tactic also used by several other Florida zoos as Hurricane Irma approaches. The solution: Keep the animals in fortified buildings until the storm passes.
In Miami, most of the animals will stay in their normal ""night houses,"" sturdy structures located behind the serene and vegetative enclosures most zoo visitors see. Magill said they're strong enough to withstand a hurricanebecause they're designed to contain powerfultigers and gorillas.
The rest of Zoo Miami's animals —smaller mammals, flamingos and birds —will be placed into kennels and moved within buildings.
During Hurricane Andrew, which devastated South Florida in 1992, Zoo Miami placed a flock of flamingos in a men's bathroom, a MacGuyver-like solution as the Category 5 storm tore through the Sunshine State. Magill said improvements to the zoo means that won't happen this time around.
Up north at Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens, the facility placed plastic and plywood on its night houses, where all of the facility's 2,000 animals will stay during Irma.
Zoo spokeswoman JJ Vitale also argued against evacuating, saying it would be ""so stressful for the animal."" The 90-acre facility, with everything from butterflies to elephants, set up video surveillance to keep an eye on the animals. Plus, a team will stay there throughout the storm.
Brevard Zoo will house larger animals in the night houses and smaller animals in its veterinary hospital. When Hurricane Matthewhit the zoo last year, a little red kangaroo was ejected from her mother's pouch.
Lauren Hinson, the zoo's collection manager, said deerand gray foxes become too stressed and thus will stay outdoors as Irma bears down.
""Most (animals) kind of hunker down, just kind of stay still, stay in one spot, kind of let it pass,"" she said. ""There are some that can get a little nervous and flighty. But for the most part, they deal with it kind of how they would in the wild.""
If the storm gets bad enough in Jacksonville, the zoo could transfer animals to another facility. At Zoo Miami, Magill said evacuation would be considered only if storm surge of flooding hit the facility.
Despite the doomsday-like forecast for South Florida, Magill says his senses tell him Zoo Miamiwill be spared. Native birds and squirrels—zoo ""freeloaders,"" Magill said —have evacuated before big storms in the past, a natural sign of nasty weather. The native animals remained at Zoo Miami on Saturday.
""I want to believe that that is sort of nature's way of telling the brunt of this storm is not going to hit us,"" he said.",0
"When wildlife photographer Clint Ralph visited Giant’s Castle in Kwa Zulu Natal, South Africa with his son, he had no idea of the internet battle he was about to launch. On his visit, he witnessed a Jackal Hawk chasing away a flock of ravens from a carcass and when he clicked the button on his camera, he caught a photo with a lot of attitude.
Ralph commented that he “loved the attitude and comedy of the shot” and he “knew it would capture the imagination of the public” but he couldn’t have known the scale as since then, an intense Photoshop battle has been raging over who can create the most badass shot. And believe me, there are some worthy contenders.

"House Republicans unveiled a draft tax bill on Thursday, calling for deep cuts in both individual and corporate tax rates.
""With this bill, we will grow our economy by delivering more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks to Americans of all walks of life,"" said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
The rollout, originally scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed to give bill drafters more time. They're still struggling to find sufficient revenue to avoid a budgetbusting score. As a result, some of the tax changes have been made temporary or phased in over time.
Here are some of the highlights of the bill (you can read the full text here):
* Seven individual tax brackets would be reduced to four brackets — 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and the current top rate of 39.6 percent remaining in place for the very wealthy.
* Corporate taxes would drop from 35 percent to 20 percent permanently.
* Standard deduction would increase from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals and from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples.
* Child tax credit would expand from $1,000 to $1,600.
* Federal deductions for state and local income and sales taxes would be eliminated, but local property taxes would be deductible up to $10,000.
* No changes to limits on 401(k) pretax contributions.
* Estate tax would kick in at $11.2 million, up from $5.49 million, but it would be fully repealed as of 2024.
* Corporate profits from overseas would no longer be taxed, but there would be a minimum 10 percent tax on foreign subsidiaries.
The plan leaves intact a top individual tax rate of 39.6 percent to address criticism that the cuts are unduly favorable to the rich. The bill would raise the income threshold at which the top tax rate would apply to $500,000 for singles and $1 million for couples. In a boost for the wealthy, the plan also eliminates the alternative minimum tax and phases out the estate tax over a period of six years.
Broadly speaking, the GOP bill would sharply reduce taxes on both individuals and corporations, potentially draining trillions of dollars from federal coffers over the next decade. The Republican budget, however, makes room for only $1.5 trillion in revenue reduction over that period. And fast-track Senate rules, designed to avoid a Democratic filibuster, say the bill can't add to the deficit beyond 10 years.
Republicans hope to offset some of the lost revenue from lower tax rates by eliminating tax breaks elsewhere in the code.
""With this plan, we are getting rid of loopholes for special interests and we are leveling the playing field,"" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.
But that is politically challenging. Two of the costliest tax breaks — for mortgage interest and gifts to charity — were declared off limits at the outset, although the draft plan restricts the mortgage deduction on future home purchases to loans of $500,000, down from the current $1 million. Efforts to curtail other popular breaks — for retirement savings and state and local taxes — have faced pushback from the White House and Republicans in high-tax states.
The bill nearly doubles the standard deduction, which will make tax filing easier for some people. However, it eliminates personal exemptions, which could adversely affect larger families.
President Trump suggested the reduced corporate tax rate would help to spur economic growth.
""At 20 percent, we're very, very competitive with the rest of the world,"" Trump said during a White House meeting to celebrate the bill's release. ""You're going to see growth and you're going to see jobs and you're going to see really wages going up.""
The bill also aims to encourage business investment by allowing companies to deduct those costs immediately, rather than spreading the deduction over a period of years. However, this provision is scheduled to sunset after five years.
In addition, a lower tax rate of 25 percent would be established for so-called pass-through businesses, such as partnerships that currently pay taxes at their owners' individual rate.
Multinational corporations would no longer be taxed on profits earned overseas, although the plan would establish a minimum tax rate of 10 percent on foreign subsidiaries.
Democrats blasted the GOP plan as a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy.
""The American people deserve real, bipartisan tax reform that puts the middle class first, [creates] good-paying jobs and lowers the deficit,"" said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. ""This Republican plan doesn't do any of that.""
Although House lawmakers floated the idea of limiting tax breaks for retirement savings, the draft bill unveiled Thursday would preserve the deduction for 401(k)-style savings.
The bill would eliminate the deduction for state and local income taxes, a move that would be particularly costly in high-tax states such as New York, New Jersey and California. In an effort to mollify House Republicans from those states, drafters included a provision to allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in local property taxes.
But Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer of New York warned that the GOP push to limit tax breaks would leave some families paying more.
""Republicans are trying to argue that the middle class gets a tax break,"" Schumer said. ""But what they won't tell you is that many, many, many middle-class families will see their taxes go up under this plan.""
The lower limit on mortgage interest that's tax-deductible is sure to invite opposition from the housing industry, a powerful player in Washington.
""Eliminating or nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and middle-class homeowners at risk,"" said William E. Brown, president of the National Association of Realtors.
The Ways and Means Committee plans to take up the draft tax bill next week, with an eye toward a House vote before Thanksgiving. Trump is eager to sign a tax overhaul by December.
""We're working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas,"" Trump said. ""It will also be tax reform and it will create jobs.""",0
"The city was fire-bombed by the allies in WW2 to teach Germans a lesson for allowing Adolf Hitler to become Führer, 83 years ago last week.
Between 13th and 15th February 1945, 722 heavy bombers of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and 527 of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city, followed by more raids later, according to Wikipedia.
In the resulting firestorm hundreds of thousands of people were killed.Some German estimates put the figure between 350,000 to 500,000.
Many of the dead were liquefied and melted into the asphalt or were left in piles of ashes amid a city in ruin.
By comparison, the atom bomb in Nagasaki killed 40,000 on day one.The victorious allies claim that only between 25,000 to 35,000 people died in the bombing of Dresden. Their count is based on identified bodies.
The incident comes just a week after two Chinese tourists were arrested for giving “Heil Hitler” salutes in Berlin.
The incident took place in the eastern German city of Dresden on Saturday morning, German mediareport, citing local police.
The 41-year-old American tourist, whose name was not disclosed, was punched by a passerby after displaying the Nazi salute multiple times near a café in downtown Dresden. The tourist, who sustained minor injuries, was apprehended by police, although the attacker fled the scene and remains at large.
The tourist was heavily intoxicated and had a blood alcohol level of 0.276 percent. He was placed under investigation for violating German laws against the display of Nazi symbols or slogans.

The American also had insignia of“unconstitutional organizations, which includes Nazi symbols,”Deutsche Wellereported. The insignia in question prompted a separate police investigation.
The incident came just a week after two Chinese tourists landed in trouble, when they were caught taking photos in front of the iconic Reichstag in Berlin, while demonstrating the prohibited Nazi salute. The duo was arrested but was eventually released after paying a fine of about $1,000.
The tourists received a relatively light punishment, as displaying such gestures or brandishing certain Nazi memorabilia can result in a prison sentence of up to three years in Germany.

"PIERRE BERG, Yves Saint Laurent’s one-time lover and lifelong business partner, was Diaghilev to YSL’s brilliant Stravinsky. A hard, demanding man, small of stature and in possession of a filthy temper, he was, to some, quite terrifying. Yet he was also a bold and successful businessman, a noted collector, a generous patron and philanthropist and a capable arts administrator. He had a profound belief in the importance of the creative impulse.
Bergé, who died on September 8th, could only have been French. With the intellect of André Malraux and the aesthetic refinement and financial nous of Jacob Rothschild (but not the inheritance), he was living proof of the synergy between culture and capitalism. In an era before supporting the arts meant fundraising above all (or “give, get or get off” as it is known among the board members of America’s biggest privately-funded arts institutions), Bergé was a social liberal and a political conservative, a mover in the circles of state-funded culture. He voted for Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, the centre-right president, in the 1981 election, but went on to flourish under the winner and Mr Giscard’s successor, Franois Mitterrand, a socialist. Bergé loaned Danielle Mitterrand evening gowns for state occasions, and the president made him head of the Opéra National de Paris in 1988. Bergé oversaw the project to build a brand new opera house at the Place de la Bastille in Paris, in honour of the 200th anniversary of the French revolution.
Bergé and Saint Laurent met in Paris in 1958, after the designer had been taken on by Christian Dior. The two men couldn’t have been more different: Bergé was stocky where Saint Laurent was as thin as a reed. Bergé was energetic, opinionated, and liked good food, wine and conversation. Bergé had grown up in a family that did not care that he was gay; for Saint Laurent’s conservative father, a pied noir in Algeria, having a gay son was a source of deep embarrassment. The boy was teased at school and had a breakdown when he was conscripted into the French army at the height of the Algerian war of independence. Six years younger than Bergé, Saint Laurent was exceptionally shy and, although a brilliant designer, needed constant care and reassurance. In fashion lore, it was un coup de foudre:love at first sight.
Though their romantic relationship came to an end in 1976, when Saint Laurent retreated into drugs, alcohol and reclusiveness, the professional partnership between the two men continued. When Saint Laurent was well, they had lunch every day and spoke through the evening on the telephone. Together, they worked on three main projects.
The fashion house was the lynchpin; it needed both men to survive. The prudent financial backers who took charge of Christian Dior after the acclaimed couturier died in 1957 proved an obdurate combination with Dior’s older, conservative clients. The young Saint Laurent felt shackled. So in 1961 Bergé sold his flat on the le Saint-Louis and the two men set up in business. Thirty years later, in the depths of recession, he asked Wasserstein Perella, a boutique investment bank, to find a buyer for Yves Saint Laurent. He set the asking price at $1bn, in cash.
In the meantime, the two had become important collectors. Decorating a magnificent duplex in Rue de Babylone (one of the most beautiful private apartments in Paris), a chateau in homage to Proust in Normandy, and Villa Oasis, their mansion retreat in Marrakech, gave Bergé and Saint Laurent the excuse to begin collecting art and antiques. In February 2009, eight months after Saint Laurent’s death, Bergé sold the lot: the three Mondrian paintings bought to celebrate the launch of Saint Laurent’s iconic shift dress, the Eileen Gray chair (a modernist icon) and the magnificent silver gilt ornaments made in northern Germany in the 17th century. The sale raised 373.9m ($448m), and Bergé divided the proceeds between various AIDS charities and a plan to build a museum in homage to Saint Laurent.
That project, which will be unveiled next month, turned out to be two museums. The first will be in Paris where the two opened their maison de couture and the second will be in Marrakech, their spiritual home. Between them the two museums will house 7,000 textiles, 8,000 sketches, 8,000 accessories and 15,000 documents: in all 38,000 objects that the two men collected obsessively. They always knew they would one day build a museum to the designer, the first of its kind in the world.
The museums will not have two 18th-century bronze heads—one of a rat and the other of a rabbit—which caused such a scandal at a Christie’s sale in 2009. The heads had been looted from the Old Summer Palace in Beijing and the Chinese government tried to have them withdrawn from the sale. On the day, though, the heads were bid for by a Chinese buyer ostentatiously waving a paddle. After the hammer went down on 15.9m ($19m), the bidder refused to pay.
Artworks that fail so publicly at auction are regarded as burned; no one will ever buy them in public. The two sculptures were returned to Bergé. He could have sold them off cheaply in a private transaction, or presented them to the Chinese government to burnish his reputation and gain influence there. Bergé played his hand his own way. After four years of negotiation, he sold them to Franois Pinault, another French businessman and collector, who wanted to present them to the Chinese himself. Bergé drove a fierce bargain, waiting for Mr Pinault to give in and pay the price he wanted. A hard, demanding man.",0
"Dearborn, Michigan was once an all-American town, whereAmerican businesses thrived andthe residents were all peace loving Americans. That has all changed in recent years thanks to the influx of Muslims that settled in the area. Thanks to Obama’s terrible policies over the last 8 years the city is being dubbed “little Baghdad”. Recently the Muslim community in the area has found a new method to bring misery to the American people. Their actions prove they have no intention of assimilating with us. Their goals should be crystal clear by now.
Immigrants from the Middle-East are entering the country in record number, with numbers in Dearborn doubling in the past five years. They are not only preparing for the takeover of America but while doing so are putting a massive strain on the economy by leeching off of welfare with bogus claims that ensure they get the most money from the government as possible. Now, these Muslims have been busted in a major welfare-fraud ring and what they have taken from the American people will make your blood boil.
Recently a Muslim food stamp crime ring was broken up in Grand Rapids, MI. Three brothers Emad Khalil Karaein, Jawad Khalil-Ahmad Karaein, and Khader Khalil Karaein have pleaded guilty to welfare fraud. The brothers ran the Middle Eastern Market where they not only sold food but also ran their crime ring. They plead guilty to fraud as a way to protect two other brothers that were also suspected of being involved with the scam that cost taxpayers $736,000 from EBT and $544,000 from WIC over the course of nine years.
Food stamps only allow recipients to purchase certain items with the cards. The brothers offered food stamp holders a lesser amount of cash than the food stamps were worth. They would, in turn, use the food stamps to buy the allowed items. The in effect stole over $1.2 million by doing this.
Michigan has made it easy for people to gain access to their welfare programs, especially Muslims. They were the first state to offer their welfare forms in Arabic. Another kicker to the Michigan welfare system is that they allow Muslim men to claim up to four wives when filing for welfare. All they have to do is list them as extended family on the form. This makes it less important for Muslim immigrants to assimilate, instead, they can keep living their lives as a separate society when they move to places like Michigan. This raises two issues: welfare abuse and trying to fundamentally change a nation. How long until Michigan also allows Muslim immigrants to set up their own Shariah courts?
One man recently did a documentary on Dearborn, Michigan and was appalled by what he learned during the filming. Many of the women weredecked out in designer clothes while flaunting their expensive cars all while living off the tax payer’s dime:
“When we’re going grocery shopping you see these young Arab ladies and girls with their kids getting out of Range Rovers using their EBT cards to get their groceries...they’re in designer clothes carrying Pradapurses and pulling out their Medicaid cards for their healthcare…they’re driving around $60,000-$70,000 vehicles and living in $250,000-$300,000 homes,” He said.
We must continue to expose the truth about what is going on in our country. Our very lives may depend on it. Thanks to people like Brian who worked on the documentary, we are learning the truth more and more every day. We cannot count on Liberals because let’s face it they are completely clueless and would rather watch the world burn than hurt anyone’s feelings. It’s time to rise America.

As Europe makes gains in its battle to stop migrants from reaching its shores, newer routes are seeing fresh traffic, a measure of the demand to reach safer lands and the dangers that await some of the world’s most vulnerable people.
Flows across the central Mediterranean Sea from Libya to Italy plunged in mid-July after Italian authorities struck an unusual deal with local Libyan militias to clamp down on human smuggling. But smaller routes have experienced an uptick, with traffic from Morocco to Spain steadily increasing and more people undertaking the perilous Black Sea passage from Turkey to Romania.
The surges do not seem to be directly related to the Libyan clampdown, but they are illustrative of migrants’ tendency to find new paths to Europe as old ones close, officials and analysts say.
“These flows aren’t necessarily the same people, but they do demonstrate that the migration routes and flows are constantly shifting,” said Elizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, a think tank.

The sharp drop-off in flows from Libya — from 22,155 people in June to 2,887 in August — has been a relief for European leaders fearful of restive voters who have started to rebel against the arrival of more migrants. Germans last week awarded Alternative for Germany, a far-right, anti-
migrant party, nearly 13percent of the vote in the national election. That came after June local elections in Italy that rewarded anti-immigrant politicians.
But the bottled-up traffic comes at a steep human cost, trapping migrants in the shifting winds of Libya’s conflict, where they often are forced into detention centers against their will and made to do labor that is little different from slavery.
Farther south, in the sub-
Saharan African nations that are the source of much of the migration through Libya, the closed route has led at least some migrants to take new paths, sometimes at the cost of their lives. Countries such as Niger are struggling to accommodate refugees from neighboring countries with no escape valve and often only limited assistance from Europe.
“When you shut down the major routes, you see a proliferation of smaller, potentially more expensive routes,” Collett said. “The fundamentals are not changed in that there are a number of simmering conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa.”
European leaders have pressed on several fronts to stem migration after a burst in 2015 of more than a million asylum seekers. Afterward, European Union leaders struck a $7.1billion deal with Turkey to seal its borders and stanch the flow. They also started to work intensively in sub-
Saharan Africa, tying development aid to countries’ willingness to accept returnees from Europe and offering fresh assistance in exchange for pledges to cut flows.
Before Libyan strongman Moammar Gaddafi’s 2011 downfall, the Italian government made similar deals with him. But since his death, the absence of a strong central authority has made exerting control deeply difficult — that is, until Italy’s outreach to local leaders this summer.
[A far-right group chartered a boat to repel migrants on the Mediterranean. Then part of its crew filed for asylum.]
Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti, a former spy chief, masterminded the plan, which funds the local governments that, critics say, are often little more than militias deeply entangled in the smuggling business themselves. Minniti denies such charges.
Italy and the E. U. also have worked to train and equip the fledgling Libyan coast guard to turn back migrant ships, an effort that has stopped up to 16,000 people so far this year, according to data compiled by the U.N. refugee agency. But the Libyan coast guard also has been implicated in abuses.
And the Italian government has engaged the warring national factions within Libya, hosting Prime Minister Fayez Serraj, the head of the U. N.-installed unity government, in July, and Gen. Khalifa Hifter, aligned with a rival eastern Libyan government, last week.
So far this year, more than 104,000 people have entered Italy, most of them before mid-July. Even though the flows have settled, many migration analysts are hesitant to declare the route closed. The instability of Libya makes any long-term predictions impossible. A small uptick in departures from the smuggling hub of Sabratha after fighting increased there starting Sept.17 was the latest reminder of the tenuous situation, said Carlotta Sami, a Rome-based spokeswoman for the U. N. refugee agency.
“It’s still a bit early to say that the route from Libya to Italy has stopped,” she said.
And in the nations leading into Libya, migration traffic also remains volatile. Niger has led a crackdown on the main smuggling route to Libya, but that has caused smugglers to search for new, more dangerous routes northward, as well as try to expand their paths into Algeria, Sami said.
“The number of people that are found dead or abandoned in the desert are increasing,” she said.
The U. N. refugee agency has pushed for more legal paths for asylum seekers to reach Europe, Sami said, a step the agency says would ease pressure on irregular migrant routes. The agency also favors increasing the range of reunification policies that enable family members to travel to Europe legally if a relative is already there, Sami said.
[‘They are not treated like humans’: Inside Libya’s thriving migrant trade]
This year, more than 19,000 migrants have arrived on Spanish shores, compared with about 9,100 over the same period last year. Unlike on the route from Libya, most of those landing in Spain are Moroccan nationals. The increase has caused nervousness among leaders and concerns about what will happen during the height of the migration season next year, after smugglers have had a chance to regroup. Migration numbers typically drop in October as temperatures fall and seas grow choppier.
And in a possible measure of smugglers’ resourcefulness, six boats this year have landed in Romania after setting sail from Turkey, carrying 572 people. The number is so small that it barely registers against pressures elsewhere, but border officials say that smugglers may be testing vulnerabilities.
“We perceive it as something that is being tested as a possibility,” said Ewa Moncure, a spokeswoman for Frontex, the E. U. border and coast guard agency. “The numbers are definitely lower, but the crisis is not over.”

"Do you live near a FEMA Camp?
What is the Federal Emergency Management Agency? Simply put, it is the “secret government”. This agency has powers and authority that go well beyond any other agency in the nation. What can FEMA do? It can suspend laws. It can move entire populations. It can arrest and detain citizens without a warrant and can hold them without a trial. It can seize property, food supplies, and transportation systems. And it can even suspend the Constitution of the United States.
When the first concept had been presented, its original mission was to assure the survivability of the United States Government in the event of a nuclear attack. It’s secondary function was to be a Federal coordinating body during times of domestic disasters. These disasters consisted of earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes.
The “secret” black helicopters that are reported throughout the US, mainly in the West California, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado areas are flown by FEMA personnel. It has been given the responsibility for many new national disasters such as forest fires, home heating emergencies, refugee situations, riots, and emergency planning for nuclear and toxic incidents. It works together with the Sixth Army in the West.
A series of Executive Orders (EO) was used to create FEMA. It does not matter whether an EO is Constitutional or not, it becomes a law simply by being published in the Federal Registry. These orders go around Congress.
There over 800 prison camps in the United States, all fully operational and ready to receive prisoners. They are all staffed and even surrounded by full-time guards, but they are all empty. These camps are to be operated by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) should Martial Law need to be implemented in the United States and all it would take is a presidential signature on a proclamation and the attorney general’s signature on a warrant to which a list of names is attached. Ask yourself if you really want to be on Ashcroft’s list.
The Rex 84 Program was established on the reasoning that if a “mass exodus” of illegal aliens crossed the Mexican/US border, they would be quickly rounded up and detained in detention centers by FEMA. Rex 84 allowed many military bases to be closed down and to be turned into prisons.
Operation Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are the two sub programs which will be implemented once the Rex 84 program is initiated for its proper purpose. Garden Plot is the program to control the population. Cable Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of the state and local governments by the federal government. FEMA is the executive arm of the coming police state and thus will head up all operations. The Presidential Executive Orders already listed on the Federal Register also are part of the legal framework for this operation.
The camps all have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from the detention facilities. Many also have an airport nearby. The majority of the camps can house a population of 20,000 prisoners. Currently, the largest of these facilities is just outside of Fairbanks, Alaska. The Alaskan facility is a massive mental health facility and can hold approximately 2 million people.
Now let’s review the justification for any actions taken…
Executive Orders associated with FEMA that would suspend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These Executive Orders have been on record for nearly 30 years and could be enacted by the stroke of a Presidential pen:…
allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.
allows the government to seize and control the communication media.
allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.
allows the government to seize all means of transportation, including personal cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and total control over all highways, seaports, and waterways.
allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.
allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.
allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare functions.
designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.
allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities.
specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.
grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.
assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period.
allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in U. S. financial institution in any undefined national emergency. It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has broad powers in every aspect of the nation. General Frank Salzedo, chief of FEMA’s Civil Security Division stated in a 1983 conference that he saw FEMA’s role as a “new frontier in the protection of individual and governmental leaders from assassination, and of civil and military installations from sabotage and/or attack, as well as prevention of dissident groups from gaining access to U.S. opinion, or a global audience in times of crisis.” FEMA’s powers were consolidated by President Carter to incorporate the…
allows for the strategic relocation of industries, services, government and other essential economic activities, and to rationalize the requirements for manpower, resources and production facilities.
gives the President sweeping powers over all aspects of the economy.
authorizes the Secretary of the Army, in time of war, to take possession of any transportation system for transporting troops, material, or any other purpose related to the emergency.
enables the President to seize the property of a foreign country or national. These powers were transferred to FEMA in a sweeping consolidation in 1979.
President Regan signed Presidential Director Number 54 in April of 1984 that allowed FEMA to activate a secret national readiness exercise. This exercise was given the code nameREX84. The purpose of the exercise was to test FEMA’s ability to assume military authority. REX 84 was so highly guarded that special metal doors were installed on the fifth floor of the FEMA building in Washington, D. C. The only people that were allowed to enter the premises were ones who had a red Christian cross on their shirt. The exercise required the following.
Suspension of the Constitution of the United States
Turning control of the government over to FEMA
Appointment of military commanders to run state and local governments

OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
There are many other locations not listed above that are worthy of consideration as a possible detention camp site, but due to space limitations and the time needed to verify, could not be included here. Virtually all military reservations, posts, bases, stations, & depots can be considered highly suspect (because it is “federal” land). Also fitting this category are “Regional Airports” and “International Airports” which also fall under federal jurisdiction and have limited-access areas. Mental hospitals, closed hospitals & nursing homes, closed military bases, wildlife refuges, state prisons, toxic waste dumps, hotels and other areas all have varying degrees of potential for being a detention camp area. The likelihood of a site being suspect increases with transportation access to the site, including airports/airstrips, railheads, navigable waterways & ports, interstate and US highways. Some facilities are “disguised” as industrial or commercial properties, camouflaged or even wholly contained inside large buildings (Indianapolis) or factories. Many inner-city buildings left vacant during the de-industrialization of America have been quietly acquired and held, sometimes retrofitted for their new uses.
CANADA
Our Canadian friends tell us that virtually all Canadian military bases, especially those north of the 50th Parallel, are all set up with concentration camps. Not even half of these can be listed, but here are a few sites with the massive land space to handle any population:
Suffield CFB – just north of Medicine Hat, less than 60 miles from the USA.
Primrose Lake Air Range – 70 miles northeast of Edmonton.
Wainwright CFB – halfway between Medicine Hat and Primrose Lake.
Ft. Nelson – Northernmost point on the BC Railway line.
Ft. McPherson – Very cold territory ~ NW Territories. Ft. Providence – Located on Great Slave Lake. Halifax – Nova Scotia. Dept. of National Defense reserve…. And others.
OVERSEAS LOCATIONS
Guayanabo, Puerto Rico – Federal prison camp facility. Capacity unknown.

"With tensions between the United States and Russia rising and on-going issues in the Middle East, many American lawmakers are criticizing the U. S. Army’s plan to cut 57,000 troops.
Senator John McCain, the Republican head of the Armed Services Committee, called the decision to cut 40,000 soldiers and 17,000 civilian personnel “another dangerous consequence of budget-driven strategy” pursued by PresidentBarack Obama.
Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush told veterans in Hudson, New Hampshire, that the United States “can’t lead without a strong military” and pursuit of the planned cuts would leave the country with “the smallest Army that we’ve had since the start of World War Two.”
The cuts would reduce the active-duty Army from about 490,000 soldiers to about 450,000. The Army had about 490,000 soldiers before the 2001 attacks, a number that rose to about 570,000 in 2010 before reductions began.
The criticism arose as Army Secretary John McHugh began notifying members of Congress about military units that would be reduced and how states would be affected. The Army plans to present fuller details of the reductions on Thursday, but USA Today published the names of some of the affected units on Tuesday.
The hardest hit bases include Fort Benning, Georgia, and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. Army officials planned to convert a 4,000-member brigade combat team at each base into a 1,050-member battalion task force, a loss of nearly 3,000 soldiers apiece, according to an Army document seen by Reuters.
Senator Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican, said he learned from McHugh that the Army planned to cut 4,350 soldiers in Georgia including 950 at Fort Stewart and 3,400 at Fort Benning. He said the cuts would take place by the end of 2017.
“I am demanding answers from the Department of Defense on how they are justifying these troop cuts in Georgia,” Isakson said in a statement. “We cannot afford to reduce our military readiness at a time when the threats to our security here at home and throughout the world are growing at an alarming rate.”
The Alaska congressional delegation said McHugh told them the Army planned to cut 2,600 soldiers at Fort Richardson and another 75 at Fort Wainwright. The lawmakers said in a statement the Army also intended to cut soldiers in Hawaii.
Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska called the cuts in her state “devastating” and “short-sighted” given the need for a robust defense in the Arctic as well as potential threats fromRussia,ChinaandNorth Korea.
“This decision was obviously made without a full understanding of the geostrategic importance of Alaska’s troops to our national security,” the state’s other senator, Dan Sullivan, said. “These decisions need to be based on strategy, not on bean-counting.”
The personnel cuts come as the Pentagon is attempting to absorb nearly $1 trillion in reductions to planned defense spending over a decade.
The reduction to 450,000 soldiers was initially announced in February 2014 when then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel unveiled the Pentagon’s 2015 budget. The figures were also included in the Quadrennial Defense Review, its four-year planning document.",1
"Twitter is firing back after the social platform received a scathing review of its presentation to congressional staffers on Thursday who are probing Russian interference in last year's U. S. presidential election.
""We brought the committees a wide range of information we proactively gathered, including inquiries into what Facebook shared with us and beyond,"" Twitter spokeswoman Emily Horne told NBC News.
This included information about measures they took during the 2016 campaign to tackle misinformation, details about how Twitter fights bots and spam on the network, and the disclosure that Kremlin-linked news outlet RT spent $274,100 on Twitter ads last year.
""The committees had not requested any specific information from us; we did this proactively, to demonstrate the kinds of inquiries we can do when we have parameters,"" she said.
Twitter's vice president for public policy, Colin Crowell, met behind closed-doors Thursday with staff members from the intelligence committees from both the Senate and the House, the company said in a blog post.
After the meeting, Senator Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" and called Twitter's response ""frankly inadequate on almost every level.""
Twitter released its longest public response to the Russian inquiry on Thursday, detailing some of what it told Congress in a blog post, while noting that some information could not be publicly shared.
The company said it removed 201 accounts linked to the same Russian operatives who used Facebook to spread misinformation during the election.
Twitter was able to link the accounts it removed to Russian entities through an internal review of roughly 450 accounts shared by Facebook, the blog post said. Those groups had 22 corresponding Twitter accounts, while 179 more accounts were linked to them.
The company's response comes as Congress is placing more scrutiny on technology companies to answer questions in the Russian meddling probe.
Facebook is in the process of handing over 3,000 advertisements to special counsel Robert Mueller and Congress, including payment data and details on how Russian entities targeted voters through Facebook's system.
Representatives from Facebook and Twitter have also been invited to testify at an open hearing before Congress regarding the Russian investigation.",0
"What’s a smoother bathroom experience worth to you? $200? $500? $750?It turns out thatsome are spending more than $10,000 on a luxury toilet that has features for before, during and after use.
The Neorest 750H by TOTO, a company founded in Japan, sells for a cool $10,200, and has the kinds of features most toilet users only dream about, including a heated seat, a warm water sprayer and an air purifying system to minimize stinky situations. Oh, and it’s also self-cleaning.
“This intelligent toilet uses an integrated UV light and special zirconium coating to break down dirt and grime in the bowl, and rinses it clean with ewater+,” which is their electrolyzed water, according to the company. Sounds futuristic, right? The company had a bit of fun with that:
They’ve even released photos where the toilet looks a bit look an alien craft from another time and place:
This toilet is also equipped with a motorized lid that opens and closes automatically. You can customize the bidet function to your liking, with different pressure settings and positions. And you can switch on any of its neat features using, of course, the remote control.
But don’t worry. If you have a power outage, there’s always the manual backup flusher!
Does this toilet already look familiar? You may have seen it on a 2016 episode of“Keeping Up With The Kardashians,”when Kylie Jenner and Kris Jenner went shopping in the TOTO showroom for a toilet up to their luxe standards, landing on the Neorest 750H.
A reporter for Business Insider tested out the so-called Mercedes Benz of toilets. Melia Robinson wrote that she was interested in the bidet function because of its massage chair-like options and the potential to reduce the environmental impact of making toilet paper. “Like a car, the Neorest 750H allows owners to set two user profiles. That way, people can save their bidet preferences and skip the settings on future uses,” Robinson wrote. But did she take one of the $10,000 toilets home? “I’d rather get a new car,” the reporter concluded.
In The Knowput together a video on Facebook that explains the main features of the Neorest 750H. More than 3.5 million people have tuned in to see what could be so unique about a toilet:
One user wasn’t sure any regular toilet could be worth $10,000: “For that price, I’d want a detailed fecal analysis with dietary advice with every flush,” Jamin Davey wrote. Another user had personal experience with this model: “Had this toilet in the suite room of the Four Seasons Hotel in Guangzhou and my goodness its so smart it automatically opens when it senses you,” wrote Maria Essa De Torres, though she wasn’t so sure about the need for a “steam” option.
What about you? Does it seem worth it? What would make you pay this much for a toilet?",1
"It’s no secret that Americans are living longer and working longer or that both trends are likely to continue. People over 65 made up 13% of the U. S. population in 2000; they’re now 19% and are expected to be 32% by 2022. AARP estimates that Americans over 50 now spend $7.1 trillion annually and, as their numbers grow, that figure will more than double, to $15 trillion by 2020. So why aren’t American businesses preparing better for the future of aging, to serve their employees and their customers? And what should they be doing?
Those were the overarching questions at the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging’s Summit on Business and the Future of Aging I just attended in Los Angeles. Similar questions were raised (or should have been — more on that shortly) at the larger Global Conference of the center’s parent, the Milken Institute, held simultaneously.
A transformational business opportunity
In a booklet for his summit participants, the center’s chairman Paul Irving wrote that the potential offered by human longevity is a “transformational business opportunity.” And yet, he added “too few business leaders appreciate that population aging will fundamentally alter the landscape in which they operate.”
That was abundantly clear at one Global Conference panel I attended, “Creating Meaningful Lives for the 21st Century Workforce: A Conversation With Top Executives.” At no point during the hour-long session did the execs — who included CEOs from Campbell Soup, Wells Fargo, eBay and EY — talk about creating meaningful lives for boomer or Gen X workers. They’re part of the 21st century workforce last I checked.
The Business and the Future of Aging summit panelists, however, were extremely concerned about this and about getting companies (and older Americans) to better address “the longevity dividend.” Here, participants tried to answer a few key questions from Irving and from co-host Peter W. Mullin, founding chairman of Mullin Barens Sanford Financial. Irving’s challenge: “How do we get the business community engaged and excited about the potential of our aging population?”
And Mullin asked: “How will we rewire, not retire? Reboot, not retread? Embrace wellderly, not elderly? And turn recreation into re-creation? Relish the opportunity of doing something we’ve always dreamed of, so we can wake up and feel good about the coming day?”
Think differently about the future of aging
Summit participant Joseph Coughlin, director of the MIT AgeLab, believes corporate America and tech entrepreneurs need to think differently: “The new ‘generation gap’ is expectations. Compared to their parents, the next generation of older adults expects not simply to live longer, but to live better. This gap in innovations is the call to innovate and is the new business opportunity.”
Even some of his students and Silicon Valley startups are missing that, however, Coughlin noted, saying: “I can’t tell you how many pill reminder systems I have seen from students and start-ups. The story we need to fill in is about transportation, housing and fun.”
A favorite new idea for older Americans that Coughlin recently saw: plans by singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett, 70, to open a string of Margaritaville-themed retirement communities, which Next Avenue wrote about.
Remember the 8,000 days
Coughlin offered one statistic that really stayed with me: 8,000 days. He said there are roughly 8,000 days between birth and college graduation; 8,000 days between college graduation and a midlife crisis; 8,000 days between a midlife crisis and retirement and, if you do retirement planning, another 8,000 days in retirement. That’s an 8,000-day business opportunity.
Summit participant Andrew Scott, co-author of The 100-Year Life and an economics professor at the London Business School, said the questions for business about the aging of their consumers and workers are: Why should firms do anything and what should they do?
The “why” answer is easier regarding the consumers, Scott said. “With more old people, there’s a lot of money at stake,” he noted. But what to do for them is harder, he added. Conversely, said Scott, employers struggle over why they should do things for their older employees. “What” they could do is easier: “Revamp recruitment, change retirement policies and offer more flexible workforces,” said Scott.
A few companies with what the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging calls “pioneering programs:” IBM, which built an Aging in Place environment in its Austin research lab to improve elder care; Michelin, which has rehired retirees to oversee projects and facilitate mentoring and Xerox, which has an ergonomic training program to reduce musculoskeletal disorders and related workers’ comp claims in its aging workforce. And firms such as Cisco Systems, Target and UnitedHealth Group are “embracing reverse mentorships,” where young employees mentor older ones, according to a recent New York Times piece.
Getting venture capitalists intrigued
That said, Seth Sternberg, the young CEO and co-founder of Honor (a Silicon Valley start-up providing non-medical home health care) revealed how hard it is to get venture capitalists (VCs) interested in investing in the older adult market. “In 2014, .7% of venture dollars went to this market. Yet it’s exploding, and already 5.5% of GDP [Gross Domestic Product],” Sternberg said. “The issue for VCs around the older adult market is they say: ‘Why should we invest something for a market that doesn’t adopt, or use, technology?’”
Yet Sternberg cleverly raised $65 million from them by debunking their stereotypes.
He asked the venture capitalists whether they could build a car and when they said they couldn’t, Sternberg explained that cars are technology but don’t feel like technology. Similarly, he said, the VCs should invest in his company because it was a human services company whose backbone was technology. And when VCs pooh-poohed older consumers as a market with an, ahem, limited term, he responded by asking them how many teenagers keep using the same product into their late 20s? The answer: almost none.
In order to persuade more venture capitalists to open their wallets for start-ups serving older Americans, Sternberg said, there need to be a couple of really big wins.
Fortunately, a few initiatives aim to make that happen. For instance, there’s the Aging 2.0 global innovation network for aging and senior care. Aging 2.0 just launched a Grand Challenges initiative to “focus and prioritize innovation in the aging space and to make an impact at scale.” AARP’s annual Innovation @50Plus LivePitch event invites start-up founders to pitch their ideas to judges and intended users. It has raised more than $80 million in investments and four LivePitch companies have been acquired.
Thinking differently about older workers
On the flip side, summit participant Patricia Milligan, who is senior partner and global leader for the Multinational Client Group of Mercer (the world’s largest human resources consulting firm), said employers needed to start thinking differently about older workers. Milligan bemoaned American businesses’ lack of a workforce strategy for older workers.
What’s more, Milligan said, employers need to get over three major categories of unconscious biases about workers over 50 that are unacceptable to say publicly. They are:
* Older workers are less productive than younger workers
* And older workers cost too much
Although older workers may not perform as well as younger ones on individual metrics, Milligan said, they are high performing in the ways they have an impact on their teams, on reducing turnover and on creating stability.
Summit participant Chip Conley, a former travel industry CEO hired at age 52 by Airbnb as a strategic advisor for hospitality and leadership, calls himself a “Modern Elder.” He’d like to see businesses assemble affinity groups of their 50-plus employees as many have for their female, minority and LGBTQ workers.
There’s also money to be made for financial services firms and for investors, Irving said, by tapping into the longevity dividend. “Why is there no major aging-focused mutual fund or ETF?” he asked. “The longevity economy may be the most exciting investment opportunity for decades to come.” Hmmm… Perhaps it’s time for an S&P 50-Plus Fund.
The fountain with youth
And summit participant Marc Freedman, founder and CEO of Encore.org — a nonprofit whose tagline is Second Acts for the Greater Good — reminded us all of the importance of doing work with purpose as we get older.
“On the one hand, mortality is a reality and we realize we won’t live forever,” said Freedman. “But on the other hand, we have the chance to do something significant with that time. It’s kind of a sweet spot in life. JFK said: ‘We’ve added years to life, now it’s time to add life to those years.’ We’ve added one month a year since then. How are we doing adding life to those years?”
Freedman’s especially keen on having older Americans mentor and assist younger ones, especially at-risk youth. “It’s not about the fountain of youth,” he said. “It’s about the fountain with youth.” And it just might make you happier, too. Freedman says Harvard Medical School professor George Vaillant’s research found that older people who engage with younger people are three times as likely to be happy as those who fail to do so.
“The goal isn’t to be young, to hang on to our fading youth,” said Freedman, “but to be there for those who actually are young.”
Summit participant Joan Ruff, board chair of AARP, said she’d like to see more conversations about aging between parents in their 50s and 60s and their children — the business leaders of tomorrow and sometimes of today.
“The women’s movement changed things because daughters talked to their fathers. To change minds about aging, we need the flipside: We need parents to talk to their sons and daughters, so they can understand, and can make changes.”
Quite a bit to chew on for CEOs, business managers and the rest of us to address the future of aging.

"Taylor Johnson started poking around when she noticed that her fellow agents acting like they were above the law. When she dug a little deeper into DHS and ICE she found the corruption. Then she was stripped of her gun and badge for no good reason.
They offered her a 100,000 severance package IF she would sign a non-disclosure agreement. They figure, money is power and I can only imagine how many people they have paid to stay quiet. But thankfully, Johnson has a conscience that can’t be bought over.
It looks like officials were taking kick backs and were cuddling up to organized crime.
Why am I not surprised? She said that during her investigation in 2013, she “discovered that EB-5 applicants from China, Russia, Pakistan and Malaysia had been approved in as little as 16 days” and that case files “lacked the basic and necessary law enforcement queries.” In other words, no one was vetted if they could pony up. Just imagine how many really, really bad guys have come in this way.
A new twist has emerged to the already growing whistle blowing case involving Special Agent Taylor Johnson’s findings within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Johnson is now saying that the DHS has tried to buy her silence by offering a $100,000 severance package in exchange for signing a non-disclosure agreement regarding the corruption she discovered within Barack Obama’s DHS.
And the hits keep coming! Trump, DRAIN THE SWAMP! Sounds more like organized crime than a government!Just wait a while, something is bound to happen to her. Lord please keep her safe from harm from our corrupt officials.",1
"Apply for an emergency loan, and you can lose your shot at a relief grant. Says one homeowner:  ""Because I was responsible, I'm being penalized.""
When a devastating flood struck Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August last year, Scott Rotolo returned home to nearly $100,000 in flood damage. Wanting to rebuild as quickly as possible, he contacted the Federal Emergency Management Agency for help. The agency directed him to the Small Business Administration—Washington’s frontline emergency lender—and he applied for, and accepted, a low-interest loan to rebuild his house and replace his possessions. To Rotolo, a 39-year-old IT worker, it seemed like the smart financial decision: The government offers a low interest rate, and the money got him back into his house quickly. He and his family moved back in March. But a few months later, he realized that that he’d made a big mistake: Because he took out a disaster loan—just over $100,000 that he needed to pay back with interest—he was not eligible for the federal disaster grants that came available a few months ago. The news came as a big surprise, Rotolo said in an interview: he didn’t see any notice from FEMA or the SBA that taking out a loan would block him from getting a disaster grant. “Because I was responsible,” he said, “I’m being punished.”As Louisiana has begun dispersing nearly $2 billion in disaster grant money over the past few months, people in the disaster-relief world are sounding the alarm that many disaster victims can be unwittingly caught in the trap that snared Rotolo. Thanks to a rule originally passed to prevent double-dipping by unscrupulous disaster victims, some of the neediest people in devastated areas can actually lose their access to relief grants.It’s not clear how many people have actually been rebuffed for grants, though Rotolo is one of 18,000 people approved for a disaster loan after the 2016 Louisiana floods, all of whom would be affected by the rule. State officials say it’s the top complaint they are hearing from disaster victims as they try to rebuild. “This is the number one issue that folks are running into,” said Richard Carbo, deputy chief of staff for Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards.“This was a massive issue 11 years ago,” said Adam Knapp, who was the policy director for the Louisiana Economic Development agency after Katrina and now is the CEO of the Baton Rouge Area Chamber of Commerce. “It was a massive issue after Sandy. It was a massive issue after our flood and still is. It’s just a forgotten issue.”This week, as a Hurricane Harvey relief bill moves quickly through Capitol Hill, officials in Louisiana are trying to convince Congress to fix the issue—so far, with no luck. On Wednesday, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards sent a letter to congressional leaders requesting they include language in the Hurricane Harvey relief bill that ensures disaster victims are not penalized for receiving an SBA loan. Neither the $7.9 billion bill passed by the House Wednesday nor the $15 billion bill passed by the Senate on Thursday included any such language, but state officials are continuing to press lawmakers. “Congress needs to act,” said Carbo.The problem has its roots in America’s two-tiered system for delivering money to disaster victims. The first and most immediate form of relief is loans: The Small Business Administration issues low-interest loans to struggling homeowners and businesses, giving them access to cash as quickly as a few weeks after the disaster, which they have to pay back with interest. The second form of relief is grants, which are more valuable—homeowners don’t need to pay them back—but can take much longer to receive.The catch: every dollar for which disaster victims are approved for an SBA loan is a dollar less they can receive from a federal grant. In other words, if a victim who is eligible for $120,000 in assistance is offered a $90,000 SBA loan, she can only receive grants worth $30,000—no matter if she accepts or declines the loan.The rule means that many people are now finding themselves boxed out of grant money they’d otherwise be qualified to receive. In some cases, disaster-relief experts and state officials said, they simply aren’t aware that when applying for loans, they’re closing off the chance to get a far more valuable grant later. “It always catches people off guard,” said Robin Keegan, the former executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which was created following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to oversee the recovery. Already, lawyers working with Harvey victims say they are unsure how to advise their clients, worried that applying for an SBA loan could prevent them from receiving grant money in the future. “It is very frustrating,” said Tracy Figueroa, a lawyer at Texas RioGrande Legal Aid who leads its office of disaster assistance.These rules arose to prevent a problem known as “duplication of benefits”—or, colloquially, double-dipping. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and major floods in the Midwest in 2008, a federal audit found that due to a bureaucratic failure, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which issues one of the two main kinds of disaster grants, sent money to people who’d already received an SBA loan to cover their losses. Such double dipping, which is prohibited by federal law, cost the government almost $1 billion, money that could have gone to other victims. The new rules, issued by HUD in 2011, were designed to prevent such bureaucratic mistakes from happening again, ensuring that federal assistance reaches those who need it most.But state officials and disaster experts say, the rules have gone too far. Along with preventing double dipping, they say, the rules penalize people who would have been better off waiting for federal grant money—leaving them saddled with thousands of dollars in debt instead of a simple payout by the government. “Now is when homeowners are really fully finding out how much their SBA loan is a barrier for them,” said Knapp. “It’s a policy choice that the federal government has made.”HUD and the SBA did not respond to a request for comment.A former HUD official who asked not to be named because she no longer speaks for the agency defended the current rules, arguing that if a disaster victim without insurance has the resources to rebuild—in other words, they can repay an SBA loan—then they should receive a loan rather than a grant. “If folks don’t have flood insurance and they get an SBA low-interest loan, isn’t that a fair benefit?” The former official further argued that allowing people who are eligible for an SBA loan to receive a grant from HUD would be expensive and unfair. “They are just expecting that they should just get a grant to rebuild. You are penalizing homeowners that pay for flood insurance.”State officials and many disaster experts see this problem differently, believing that even people with the means to rebuild deserve some grant money, instead of being saddled with tens of thousands of dollars in loans. “Sometimes the fact that you are bankable and can take out an SBA loan doesn’t mean you are as well-resourced that you can take on that burden of debt,” said Keegan, who is now the director of Resilient Baton Rouge, a group formed last year to provide behavioral health services to last year’s flood victims. “What I’ve heard a lot in implementation woes of these programs is people are dipping into savings, retirement benefits or a college fund just to make ends meet.”More importantly, they say, agencies must do a much better job explaining to disaster victims that applying for an SBA loan can hurt them in the future when they seek grant money. Asked whether agencies make that information clear, Figueroa said, “Not at all.”“It’s hard for somebody who is on the phone with FEMA and being told that you better apply for that SBA loan because otherwise we can’t even think about giving you FEMA money,” she said. “They are applying for stuff, doing whatever they need to scrape together a way to begin to recover and then grant programs come out later and [they say,] ‘Oops sorry you got a loan so we can’t give you this grant.’”A FEMA spokesperson said that the agency warns people about the ban on duplication multiple times: when they first register for FEMA assistance, on the eligibility letter they receive, and also in a release form when registering. “This form places the applicant on notice that they are required to return any FEMA assistance that is covered by another source such as insurance,” the spokesman wrote in an email.Controversy around the “duplication of benefits” rules also arose after Superstorm Sandy when New York lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo worried that HUD would attempt to claw back money that victims had received through disaster grants and from a flood insurance settlement. The lawmakers successfully negotiated a waiver that protected certain, low-income victims from clawbacks by FEMA for certain overpayments.Edwards would like to see a much bigger change: It’s only fair, he says, to allow people who receive an SBA loan to take advantage of HUD disaster grants as well. In February, he sent a letter to the congressional delegation asking for a legislative change to either forgive SBA disaster loans taken out by victims of last year’s flooding—in other words, turn the loans into outright grants—or to allow those victims to also receive HUD grants. In August, he sent a letter to Ben Carson, the secretary of HUD, asking for a regulatory change that would effectively accomplish the same thing. In that letter, Edwards appealed not just for his state but for disaster victims elsewhere in the U.S. “This is, perhaps, the single biggest change we can make to support homeowners,” he wrote, “not just in Louisiana, but across the country.” Scott Rotolo says he’s hoping that Edwards’ efforts will succeed. If he had known that the SBA loan would have made him ineligible for a grant, he said he would have taken out a private loan at the market interest rate, and then applied for a grant when that money became available. Now it’s too late. The SBA loan is effectively a second mortgage on a house he just moved into last year. “I can’t maintain the lifestyle I had before,” he said. “I’m just right there in the middle class and I don’t have an extra $430 a month.”“It’s going to be tough,” he added. “But I’ll find a way.”

"Primark and Sports Direct have had to pay thousands of pounds back to staff for paying them below the minimum wage.
The retailers had to repay the most of 260 firms named on the government's list for paying their staff below the legal minimum.
Primark had to repay 231,973.12 mainly due to charging staff for uniforms.
Sports Direct, and two staff agencies it used, had to pay back a total of 1.1m to their workers. All firms said the issues were now rectified.
A spokesperson for Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, said its uniform policy changed last year and that it ""had reviewed its procedures in order to avoid this situation re-occurring.""
They said the average amount paid to the almost 10,000 staff affected was 23.75.
Sports Direct - together with the two agencies, Transline and Best Connection which it used to supply its staff - underpaid more than 4,000 staff in total.
The retailer said the underpayment related to a ""historical situation in our warehouse that was widely publicised in 2016"".
An investigation by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) last year found that some workers at the retailer's main distribution centre in Shirebrook, Derbyshire had been docked a quarter of an hour's pay if they clocked on one minute late.
They also had to queue for an average of 11 minutes for security checks after their shifts had finished.
This meant that some workers' pay fell below the minimum wage, or the National Living Wage for those aged over 25.
A number of football clubs were also named on the government's list including Bristol Rovers; Wolves and Torquay in England and Motherwell; Greenock Morton and Falkirk in Scotland.
Motherwell said the underpayment was due to ""an administrative error"" by the club.
Overall, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said 16,000 workers had not received at least the minimum wage in its latest list, which it publishes twice a year.
It said this was the highest number of employees affected since it first published the list in 2013.
Collectively the workers are due 1.7m in back pay.
The firms named on the list have also been fined a total of 1.3m by the government.
The most common reasons for firms underpaying staff were failing to pay workers when they were travelling between jobs, not paying overtime and deducting money from staff pay for uniforms.
1. The Best Connection Group Limited, Bromsgrove B61, failed to pay 469,273.83 to 2,558 workers.
2. Qualitycourse Limited trading as Transline Group, Calderdale HD6, failed to pay 310,302.12 to 1,421 workers.
5. Edward Mackay Contractor Ltd, Highland KW9, failed to pay 51,403.65 to four workers.
Business minister Margot James said ""there is no excuse for not paying staff the wages they're entitled to"".
Despite the government's apparent success in cracking down on pay, it is thought that hundreds of thousands of workers are still not getting their legal entitlement.
In October last year the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the number of people whose pay was below the headline rate of the National Minimum Wage was 362,000.
However that number includes workers whose pay levels are perfectly legal. For example, those who have accommodation or other benefits supplied as part of the job.
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said minimum wage dodging had ""reached chronic levels in shops, salons and hospitality"" and urged the government to focus on these sectors.",0
"The number of migrants sleeping rough on the streets of Paris has risen by at least a third since the start of the week when the “Jungle” shanty town in Calais was evacuated.
Along the bustling boulevards and a canal in a northeastern corner of Paris, hundreds of tents have been pitched by asylum seekers – mostly Africans who say they are from Sudan – with cardboard on the ground to try and insulate them from the cold.
While their presence is not new, it has grown substantially this week, said Colombe Brossel, Paris deputy mayor in charge of security issues.
“We have seen a big increase since the start of the week. Last night our teams counted 40 to 50 new tents there in two days,” Brossel said, adding there was now a total of 700 to 750.
This means there are some 2,000-2,500 people sleeping rough in Paris, up from about 1,500 a few days before, she said.
“It’s not a huge explosion in numbers, but there is a clear increase,” she said. “Some of them come from Calais, others from other places.”
After years as serving as an illegal base camp for refugees and migrants trying to get to Britain, the Jungle was finally bulldozed this week and the more than 6,000 residents of the ramshackle camp near the English channel were relocated to shelters around France.
France’s asylum chief Pascal Brice said the arrivals in Paris did not mean there had been a wholesale movement from the Jungle to the capital.
“There might be some movements at the margins [toward Paris] but what is crucial is that those 6,000 people have been protected,” he said.
Between the Stalingrad and Jaures Paris metro stations, migrants who spent the night camped out on the median strip of a major road, with traffic passing on either side, had scattered on Friday morning, many carrying their tents while police patrolled the centre of the boulevard.
“There’s a lot of new people here,” said Mustafa, 21, from Darfur, as he waited on the side of the road.
Ali, also from Sudan, said: “I see more people than before. People came yesterday and before yesterday from Calais.”
Authorities said the newcomers did not come only from Calais. Others did but had arrived before the dismantlement of the camp, they said.
Ama, a 24-year-old Sudanese who is six-months pregnant, said she had come to Paris from Calais, but that was months ago.
“I was in Calais before but I did not find the route [to Britain],” she said. “I couldn’t stay over there being pregnant, it was too hard.”
Deputy Mayor Brossel said it was up to the central government, not city authorities, to act.
“These people must be sheltered,” she said.
The city of Paris has plans to open two reception centres but they would only have a total capacity of fewer than 1,000 beds.
France and the UK have been feuding over who should take responsibility for the 1,500 minors who were living in Calais.
French President Francois Hollande said on Saturday that he had spoken with British Prime Minister Theresa May to convey the message that Britain should take its share of responsibility for minors from the Jungle camp.
Meanwhile, British Home Secretary Amber Rudd told her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, that his government must guarantee the protection of youngsters left in limbo after the evacuation.",1

Mark Levin isn't happy with the Republican tax cut plan. Mark explains his reservations on one of his CRTV shows. Perhaps some are unaware of the new CRTV live streamed shows offered.
The CR stands for conservative review. There are numerous hosts featured, in fact, Phil Robertson, (I think that's his name) one of the duck dynasty guys has recently been added.
Mark Levin is my favorite. Mark doesn't mince words, he tells it like it is, and on one of his recent shows he calls out the Republican's and the president for a phony tax cut that is no cut at all when the elimination of deductions are factored in.
Perhaps now, more than ever, most of us are realizing that neither party is capable of doing right by the working folks.
Both parties, seem now to be drifting more rapidly towards socialism, rather than focusing on the capitalistic system that has been the foundation of the greatest economy ever know in the world.
Don't ask me how, but I suspect this tax cut that isn't a tax cut is somehow tied to a strategy that moves us closer to a globalized economy and an increasing loss of sovereignty.

Tucker Carlson had Kelly Anne Conway on his interview segment and asked her specifically; We know what percentage reduction the very rich will get in taxes and we know what percentage business will get in taxes but what percentage do lower income people get in tax reduction?  Conway hemmed and hawed and talked about economy stimulation and increased investment in jobs and oft repeated simplification in filing ""on a postcard"" etc, etc, until it was obvious there was no reduction; it was the same old trickle down BS we have been fed forever, which never works and requires militant unions to undo.
The new tax structure is insulting in that they believe the mass of people are too stupid to figure out and file a tax return and that we won't catch on to the fact they have eliminated deductions and thus increased our taxes.  It isn't new, John Kennedy pulled the same trick when he reformed taxes: first he eliminated deductions and gave a slightly lower tax rate and then raised the tax rate each year until you payed much more than before the tax reform.
Nothing ever changes, the tax laws are rigged to favor the wealthy and screw the poor no matter which group is in power.
just wondering, what kind of country would we have without ALL these wealthy people. I am sick and tired hearing about the top 1%. God bless America.

Middle Class, time to tighten our belts. Middle Class in disguise are supposed to be the beneficiary of this misguided tax cut. But I still believe middle class are the victims. It is a simple math calculation, no matter how you call it. I hope Congress revises some of the proposals allowing deductions of items that are taxed twice like property tax, and retain the personal exemptions. I don't care about doubling of the standard deduction, by eliminating major items from deductions.
Every time money moves, it is being taxed. I need to see the whole tax structure. The tax proposal could not be done on a small post card, please don't show me that.  I think that's being stupid. I think it still needs 1 or 2 pages of the return considering some revisions of the proposal. All supporting documents need to prove your figures. And even businesses require more than 2 pages.  Congress, please allow us to see the whole structure. I don't know what's cooking inside there.

A more equitable, fair and growing economy for EVERYONE.
Productivity has surged, but income and wages have stagnated for most Americans. If the median household income had kept pace with the economy since 1970, it would now be nearly $92,000, not $50,000.
The sectors that have contributed the most to the country's overall economic growth have lagged when it comes to creating jobs.
The wage freeze
Increase in real value of the minimum wage since 1990: 21%
Increase in cost of living since 1990: 67%
One year's earnings at the minimum wage: $15,080
Income required for a single worker to have real economic security: $30,000
More and more, US multinationals are laying off workers at home and hiring overseas.

The problem is inflation. The value of money shrunk. One of the factors adversely affecting inflation is demand. But government has no means to meet that demands. People must have jobs to be productive.  Our population has increased so much, demand therefore increases for their essential needs, but production decreased. People are supposed to be the sources of production. But with the influx and tens of millions of non-productive people, our economy is underway to a 3rd world.
I wonder why these people yell, call this country racist, and evil, but they continue to come and flock here, no other purpose  but to hand out. They have no productive skills, and could not work on shovel ready jobs that could not even sustain their families. They all end up dependents on those who productively work and  pay taxes.
During the administration of Mr. Obama, 45.3% of households,  nearly 77,500 million don't pay any income tax. Instead these are dependents. They are being feed, given all  kinds of benefits on medical, housing, education, utilities by US taxpayers. Yet they march on the streets, calling us all kinds of evil words. Some cause violence, and mayhem. E.g. DACA.
Instead of proving that they can contribute to society, they become adamant, and violent on their demands. Some work to support them, but majority are still dependents and non-productive.
There are approximately 1,500,000 children of illegal aliens on public schools costing the taxpayers $52 billion annually. Then they make more children, become anchor babies who now claim they have the roots and could not be removed. These alone contribute to inflation.
China, Japan, and other countries don't just accept anybody to stay in their country. It is only the US who accepts all kinds of enemies and leeches who allow them to come and abuse the system. Others terrorize us.
Millions of Americans have sacrificed, their  lives and blood poured out to give us freedom, and liberty. Yet, still so many knees bending on protests, dismantle our history, destroy our flag that represents our freedom, disrespect our National Anthem. While those in protests are the very people who benefit the price of our liberty.

In a true capitalist system, organizations and people who assumed too much risk and made poor decisions would fail. But the United States does not have a capitalist system. We have a corporate fascist economic system where a small cartel of bankers, military weapons suppliers, and mega-corporations set the agenda for the country through their complete capture of politicians and the mainstream corporate media. At the height of the crisis in 2008, President George Bush revealed whose side he chose:
""I've abandoned free-market principles to save the free-market system, to make sure the economy doesn't collapse. I feel a sense of obligation to my successor to make sure there is not a, you know, a huge economic crisis. Look, we're in a crisis now. I mean, this is - we're in a huge recession, but I don't I've abandoned free-market principles to save the free-market system, to make sure the economy doesn't collapse. I feel a sense of obligation to my successor to make sure there is not a, you know, a huge economic crisis. Look, we're in a crisis now. I mean, this is - we're in a huge recession, but I don't want to make it even worse.
George Bush was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He was not trying to save the free-market system, because we didn't have a free market system. He was saving his fellow billionaires under the cover of saving the average American.
The President was a multi-millionaire. The Treasury Secretary was a billionaire. There were 250 millionaires in Congress. The top executives of the banks that own and control the Federal Reserve are multi-millionaires. The owners and talking head pundits of the mainstream media are all in the billionaire/millionaire class. The cover story used to bilk $700 billion from middle class taxpayers into the coffers of Wall Street mega-banks was that if we didn't hand over the loot, the financial system would collapse and a Great Depression would ensue. Every program, policy, and rule change that has been rolled out since September 2008 by the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and Congress has benefitted billionaires, bankers, and politically connected corporations. The Federal Reserve has printed over $2 trillion out of thin air to save the billionaires that have been pillaging the middle class for decades.
The standard of living for the average American continues to fall. Real household income is lower than it was in 1999. The only reason it increased in the 1980s and 1990s was the huge influx of women into the workforce. Two earners were needed to try and maintain a constant standard of living. Real average weekly earnings are lower today than they were in 1970, even using the government bastardized CPI calculation that has been so massaged since 1982 that it has only resulted in a happy ending for government bureaucrats at the BLS. Calculating the CPI exactly as it was calculated in 1980 reveals the truth of what the Federal Reserve has wrought on working class America, a drastic decrease in their standard of living. The insidiousness of Federal Reserve created inflation has sucked the life out of the middle class and enriched the cocktail party class.
The Federal Reserve has slowly and methodically destroyed the American middle class through relentlessly printing more money and purposefully creating inflation, since its reprehensible creation in 1913. For the last three decades only one voice in the wilderness of Washington DC has fought this banking cabal.
""Since the creation of the Federal Reserve, middle and working-class Americans have been victimized by a boom-and-bust monetary policy. In addition, most Americans have suffered a steadily eroding purchasing power because of the Federal Reserve's inflationary policies. This represents a real, if hidden, tax imposed on the American people.
From the Great Depression, to the stagflation of the seventies, to the burst of the dotcom bubble last year, every economic downturn suffered by the country over the last 80 years can be traced to Federal Reserve policy. The Fed has followed a consistent policy of flooding the economy with easy money, leading to a misallocation of resources and an artificial boom followed by a recession or depression when the Fed-created bubble bursts. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand up for working Americans by putting an end to the manipulation of the money supply which erodes Americans' standard of living, enlarges big government, and enriches well-connected elites, by cosponsoring my legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve."" - Ron Paul - Sept 10, 2002
His colleagues in Congress did not stand up to the Federal Reserve in 2002. Instead, they cheered them on as Greenspan's ultra loose monetary policy led to the greatest housing bubble in history and a financial collapse unparalleled in human history. As the collapse was hurdling down the track in 2006, Representative Paul once again rose in protest against an organization that is rapidly destroying the American dream.
""The coming dollar crisis is not likely to be fixed by politicians who are unwilling to make hard choices, admit mistakes, and spend less money. Demographic trends will place even greater demands on Congress to maintain benefits for millions of older Americans who are dependent on the federal government.
Faced with uncomfortable financial realities, Congress will seek to avoid the day of reckoning by the most expedient means available - and the Federal Reserve undoubtedly will accommodate Washington by printing more dollars to pay the bills. The Fed is the enabler for the spending addicts in Congress, who would rather spend new fiat money than face the political consequences of raising taxes or borrowing more abroad.
The irony is that many of the Fed's biggest cheerleaders are the same supposed capitalists who denounced centralized economic planning when practiced by the former Soviet Union. Large banks and Wall Street firms love the Fed's easy money policy, because they profit at the front end from the resulting loan boom and artificially high equity prices. It's the little guy who loses when the inflated dollars finally trickle down to him and erode his buying power. Someday Americans will understand that Federal Reserve bankers have no magic ability - and certainly no legal or moral right - to decide how much money should exist and what the cost of borrowing money should be."" - Ron Paul - July 11, 2006

Ron Paul is the lone ""voice in the wilderness"" and he is exactly correct.  The Feds policies are the reason it is no longer prudent to save money.  This lack of savings leads to precarious living conditions and is conducive in converting law-abiding citizens into criminal behavior.
The ever-increasing money supply, chasing too many useless goods, causes prices to rise and this in effect decreases the real value of the money you earn.  In essence, your pay is cut each year by the actual increase in inflation, not the fake numbers issued by the government.
The Fed has the golden egg laying goose.  When the government needs money the Fed lends it to them.  Where did the Fed get the money?  They made and entry in an accounting program with a few keystrokes.  In return they got a bond from the government, which is a lien on the productivity of the nation.  These bonds pay interest and the Fed then markets some of these bonds too fat-cat 1 percenters who enjoy an income guaranteed by the power of the government to tax its citizens enough to pay the interest and principle of the bonds.
The Fed had no money, just a book entry.  In return they made money on the interest of the bonds they kept and from the market sales of the bonds thy sold.  Good trick, trade a paper entry for real income.  Where does the real wealth come from?  Out of the pockets of all citizens whose money has been devalued.

Goddamn it, they pay plenty of other taxes! For starters, 15.3% of their gross in Social Security and Medicare taxes on incomes of $120,000 and below. How come the wealthy do not have to pay on ALL their earned incomes and unearned incomes such as dividend and capital gains? There are a myriad of other taxes, both federal and state, the the poor pay. Income tax is what they ALWAYS use to brainwash the ignorant with that the rich pay all the taxes.

Only the Federal Reserve owns more U. S. federal government debt than entities in the Peoples Republic of China, according to the latest data released by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
As of the end of August, according to the Treasury, entities in Mainland China owned $1,200,500,000,000 in U.S. Treasury securities.
The only other nation that came close to that was Japan. Entities located there owned $1,101,700,000,000 in U.S. Treasury securities as of the end of August.
Ireland was a distant third, with entities there owning $307,200,000,000 in U.S. Treasury securities.
Read above post about what has been said about the evil, illegal, privately owned federal reserve.
But the Federal Reserve here in the United States owned far more in U.S. government debt than entities located in any foreign land.",1
"While that may seem an incremental and mostly procedural step, legal experts not involved in the case said Judge Tigar’s ruling sent a clear message to public company officers and directors: be vigilant for bad behavior in your operations, or else.
The court concluded that the complaint’s allegations had plausibly suggested that a majority of the Wells Fargo directors had “consciously disregarded an obligation to be reasonably informed about the business and its risks or consciously disregarded the duty to monitor and oversee the business.”
This ruling will resonate among corporate directors, securities lawyers said. “It’s a reminder that you can’t just be a passive figurehead on a board and keep your fingers crossed that nothing will go wrong,” said Lewis D. Lowenfels, an expert in securities law in New York. “You have to be actively involved and cognizant of what’s going on with respect to the company, or you could very well face liabilities.”
The judge didn’t stop at Wells Fargo’s directors. He was also tough on some of the bank’s executives, stating that these defendants must have known about the improper account-opening practices because they had access to internal information, including data about the company’s promotion of in-house products to clients, known as cross-selling.
“Just as it is implausible that the director defendants were unaware of the account-creation scheme given the extent of the alleged fraud and the number of red flags,” the judge wrote, “it is implausible that Wells Fargo’s senior management, involved in the day-to-day operations of the bank and with greater access to the underlying cross-sell metrics and employee whistle-blower complaints than independent board members, was unaware of the alleged fraud.”
I wanted to talk with one or more of the Wells Fargo directors about the judge’s ruling and whether they are doing anything differently in the aftermath of the account-opening imbroglio. Through a company spokeswoman, Arati S. Randolph, they declined to comment.
“We disagree with the allegations in the complaint and believe the board has at all times acted in full accordance with its fiduciary obligations,” Ms. Randolph said in a statement. “Since the time frame at issue in the complaint, the board has also taken a range of actions that have even further strengthened the company’s corporate governance, including commissioning a board-led independent investigation, a board self-evaluation, changes in board and board committee composition, changes in senior management, and clawbacks and other executive accountability actions.”
Of course, both cases against Wells Fargo are in the early stages. And it’s rare that corporate directors and officers have to worry about legal liabilities arising from their action or inaction. These officials are typically protected against such things by large insurance policies paid for by their companies. A lingering question in some cases, though, is whether the insurance policy is big enough to cover a settlement or award.
The settlement of a landmark investor suit in 2005 took a different tack. It involved securities issued by WorldCom, a bankrupt telecommunications company, and the settlement required WorldCom’s directors to dig into their own pockets to pay almost $25 million to the plaintiffs. Eleven of the 12 WorldCom directors paid more than 20 percent of their aggregate net worth in the settlement.
Wells Fargo is obviously not WorldCom. But some lawyers said the recent Wells Fargo ruling might deliver an even louder warning to directors. That’s because the WorldCom directors had signed securities offering statements that contained inaccuracies, assigning those board members direct responsibility.
There’s no specific stock or bond offering in the Wells Fargo matter. Although the plaintiffs contend that the bank’s directors made false or misleading statements related to risk-management processes and internal controls in its regulatory filings, the case is more about the basic duties a director has to oversee and monitor a corporation’s activities.
Indeed, in their lawsuit the plaintiffs contend that each of the directors they have sued either led or was a member of a board committee “responsible for oversight of the allegedly fraudulent banking practices.” The committees are audit and examination; corporate responsibility; governance and nominating; human resources; and risk.
Last year, Wells Fargo’s directors received cash and stock-based pay of $300,000 to $486,000 for a full year’s work, its proxy filing shows. These amounts exceeded the median pay package of $245,000 for directors at Standard & Poor’s 500 companies in 2016, according to Equilar, a compensation analysis company.
Also noteworthy: last year, as the account scandal grew, Wells Fargo’s independent directors hired their own lobbying firm. Since then, they have spent $600,000 lobbying Congress on “issues related to congressional investigations of Wells Fargo,” according to documents on the website of the Center for Responsive Politics. It is highly unusual for independent directors to engage their own lobbyists.
Oral arguments in the second shareholder suit relating to Wells Fargo’s account-opening mess had been scheduled for Nov. 7. At that hearing, Wells Fargo’s lawyers were going to lay out their reasons for why the judge should dismiss the case.
But on Oct. 30, Judge Tigar canceled the hearing, saying the matter could be disposed of “without oral argument.” This suggests he will allow the case to move forward, legal experts said.

"The EB-5 immigrant investor program was introduced by Congress in 1990 through the Immigration Act. The EB-5 visa provides an opportunity for foreign investors to acquire permanent residence in the U. S. From the time it was established, EB-5 Visa has been a reliable source of investment for projects in the U.S. As an entrepreneur, expansion should be part of your plan. Broadening your horizons to the U.S. is an expansion plan with promising returns. However, before you think of investing in the U.S., you should understand how the EB-5 immigrant investor program operates.
Our Mission at My Life Optics is to make sure your precious moments will never again be lost moments. We are a progressive technology company focused on securing captured moments from wearable tech for Alzheimer’s patients and the public alike. We will utilize emerging contact lens video technologies to continue our development of the most secure and user friendly contact lens software and personal memory storage. Our focus is on innovation as well as human values, knowing that having the ability to relive past moments is useless without keeping your life’s precious video memories safe and secure.
What Are the Requirements For An EB-5 Visa?
To qualify for an EB-5 Visa, three conditions need to be satisfied:
You must invest at least $1 million in a new business in the U. S. Alternatively; you could invest at least $500,000 in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA).
You must prove that your capital is derived from a lawful source. This means that you should show that your capital is not generated from illegal activities such as drug trafficking. This is in accordance with the Immigration’s Act section 203(b) (5).
You must demonstrate how your investment has created or will create at least 10 new jobs for U.S. residents
To determine whether an EB-5 Visa is viable for you, there are three questions you need to ask yourself:
Is your business located in the right area? The answer to this question will help you determine whether your minimum investment is $1 million or $500,000
Can your business create enough jobs? Provided you have a realistic and efficient plan for creating job opportunities, you are good to go.
Is your business plan viable? You need an EB-5 compliant business plan. While your business plan might work, it does not hurt to have an economic expert or overseas migration agents help you draft a business plan bearing in mind your objectives and in accordance with EB-5 requirements.
The Two Crucial Steps Towards Obtaining an EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa
One of the conditions of the EB-5 visa is that you need to become a 2 year conditional U. S. resident to allow you to implement your investment project. You will only be allowed to become a U.S. resident after your I-526 petition is accepted by USCIS (U.S. Immigration and Citizenship Services). There are two ways of attaining residency:
* If you already have legal status in the U.S., you need to file a form I-485 to change your status to that of a conditional permanent resident.
* If you do not have legal status in the U.S., you need to apply for an immigrant visa through submitting the DS-2330 form that is processed through the U.S. embassy in your home country.
These steps require the assistance of an EB-5 lawyer. The immigrant visa is usually issued within 6-12 months. During the 2 year conditional residency term, you are required to be physically present in the U. S., and are not allowed to stay outside the U.S. for over one year without getting a permit for re-entry.
The last step in acquiring an EB-5 visa is for you to become an unconditional permanent resident through removing your 2 year conditional status. You need to submit the I-829 petition to prove that you have adhered to all the terms of the EB-5 visa program. You can expect USCIS to grant you a permanent green card 6-8 months after submitting the I-829 petition. This allows you, your spouse, and your unmarried children who are below 21 years to live and work permanently in the U. S. You and your family also have the option of becoming U.S. citizens five years after receiving the conditional residency.
Obtaining an EB-5 visa is an easy process if facilitated by an immigration attorney. Provided you have the required investment amount, an ideal location for your business, and a viable business plan, you are good to go. Gaining an EB-5 visa will not only enable you expand your business but it will open up numerous opportunities for you and your family in the U. S.",1
"As France prepare to host millions of visitors at the Euro 2016 Football Championships, a state of emergency has been extended in the country as it faces its largest protests in recent history.
Hundreds of thousands of citizens have taken to the streets in France, amounting to what some are calling the new French Revolution amid a total media blackout in Western news outlets.
The first collaborative protest against the Socialist government since Hollande came to power in 2012, kicked off on 9 March. On March 31, nearly 400,000 people took to the streets, disagreeing with thesweeping changes to labor laws; though organizers put the number at 1.2 million.
On April 9, about 120,000 people marched in Paris and across France for a sixth time, protesting against contested labor reforms. Organizers called for yet another strike on April 28, and a massive protest on May 1, Labor Day. Reports of police officers clashing with protesters, deploying tear gas in several French cities, and protesters burning vehicles, smashing windows flooded the Internet.
In his response, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said in the city of Lyon:
“I call on the organizers of these demonstrations to condemn with the same firmness that I do the unrest caused by these handful of thugs.”
Demanding a complete withdrawal of the draft reform bill, French workers stepped up protests, rallies and blockades in the third week of May. As per the latest updates, one in three gas stations across the country run dry, causing long queues at normally well-stocked stations. There are blockades at 5 of France’s 8 oil refineries. Nearly 1/5th of nuclear power output is cut by striking staff. Since the nation’s electricity supply has dropped, the government is forced to dig into its emergency reserves.
On May 26, more than 150,000 marched against the government’s plans to make it easier for firms to hire and fire. Reuters reports:
In the southwestern city of Bordeaux, about 100 people targeted a police station, throwing objects and damaging a police car. In Paris and in the western city of Nantes, bank windows were broken and protesters clashed with police. The next big day of protests is planned on June 14 [when French senators begin discussing the reform package], four days after the Euro 2016 soccer tournament opens in France. The CGT warned it could be disrupted if the government refuses to withdraw the draft reform bill.
Although, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls is willing to modify some of the proposals, workers’ unions are unwilling to back down. Particularly angry that the government is enacting a constitutional power to bypass parliament to pass the bill, several unions led by one of the country’s largest unions, the General Confederation of Labor (or the CGT),declared in an open letter:
“This week, the actions, the strikes and the blockades by workers from a number of industries to demand the retraction of this labor bill and to obtain new rights show that our determination remains intact.”
1. Makes it easier for companies to lay off staff and cut costs in difficult economic times.
2. Allows companies to opt out of national labor protection rules if they reach in-house deals on pay and conditions with the consent of a majority of their staff – and not the trade unions.
3. Allows employers to extend the legal work week from current 35 hours to 48 hours – up to 60 hours with an ‘exceptional authorization’, and reduce overtime from current 25% to not less than 10%.
4. Proposes surtax on short-term contracts aimed at getting employers to hire more people on permanent contracts
5. Introduces a cap – 15 months of pay – on compensation in cases of unfair dismissal.
Plagued by dismal popularity ratings and high unemployment, President Hollande, who staked his whole term in office on improving life for the country’s struggling youth, says the labor reform is vital to tackle joblessness. Labor Minister Myrian El Khomri, too, defends the new labor law dubbed “the bosses law” by its opponents.
“This law corresponds to the situation in our country. We have an unemployment rate of over 10% the same as it was 20 years ago. It has improved over the last month, however that is not satisfactory. Our country created fewer jobs than other European countries [Between 2013 and 2015, 57,000 jobs were created in France, 482,000 in Germany, 651,000 in Spain and 288,000 in Italy.] So for me the text and the goal of this reform is to be able to just improve access to employment.”
However, opponents of the labor reform say it will threaten cherished rights and deepen job insecurity for young people by helping companies fire staff arbitrarily. Henry Samuel and Raziye Akkoc of The Telegraph observed:
The government believes it will create thousands of jobs but the IMF, and the French opposition say the reform doesn’t go nearly far enough to significantly reverse record unemployment, now at 10%, and soaring public debt, due to reach 98% of GDP next year.
This is the first time a Socialist French government has faced a nationwide trade union rebellion in more than 30 years. The left’s opposition to the reforms has been vast, threatening to tear apart Hollande’s own support base.
The proposed reform has compounded the fury of many within the Socialist Party and the further left at what they see as the treacherous, rightward course of the Hollande-Valls government. The protests have been led by the former Socialist leader, and “mother” of the 35-hour week, Martine Aubry, who has resigned from all her official positions within the party. Aubry complains that the rewriting of French employment law in line with “liberal” pro-market dogma is a betrayal of the French “social contract.”
An online petition against the proposed changes has gathered over 1 million signatures, a record in France. According to a recent Le Parisien poll, a majority of French people favor labor reforms, but 70% oppose the government’s way of going about it.
It will be a political suicide for Hollande if he rolls back the labor reform – he has promised he will not run for re-election next year unless he manages to stem the rise in unemployment. But as The Guardian rightly notes, it is not just Hollande’s political survival at stake, though, but the image of France itself.",1
"I’m half-submerged in the Mekong River—the watery border that separates Laos from Thailand and Myanmar—sitting atop a big-eared, pink-spotted, 3-ton elephant named Poonlarp. Her skin looks soft from a distance, but it’s much coarser up close, covered in inch-long bristles. Her gait, which at first gives the appearance of flowing-through-honey movement, feels wobbly up this high. She’s alternately headstrong and playful. If you’ve ever walked a large, stubborn dog, you have an idea what it’s like to ride an elephant. This is the bucket-list item that brings people here to Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp & Resort. Perched directly on top of Poonlarp’s wide shoulders, forcing my legs into a permanent straddle behind her ears, magnifies her immensity. At one point, she takes a deep drink and sprays the water gleefully, like a living fountain, out of her trunk.
It’s my second day at Golden Triangle, a 63-room honeymoon spot set among the rice paddies and tea plantations of far-north Chiang Rai province in Thailand. I flew with my sister to Bangkok from New York, then caught an hourlong connecting flight. The van that picked us up had massage chairs instead of passenger seats and a welcome basket filled with cold face towels and elephant-shaped shortbread cookies. We arrived after sunset, in time for a late dinner of papaya salad and pad thai.
It wasn’t until 5 a.m. this morning, jet-lagged and awake on the terrace, that I first heard the soundtrack of elephant roars. It started off quietly but grew louder as the sun rose and a band of tiny-looking animals emerged from shadows in the distance.
The resortstarted in the early 2000s, when Bangkok-based Minor Hotels acquired a Le Méridien and transformed it into a five-star resort. The company’s chief executive officer, William Heinecke, had the idea to turn the new property into an elephant camp—he loves the animals and felt the Polynesian-style resort’s small footprint on a 200-acre parcel of land would lend itself to a luxury wildlife experience. The task was given to John Roberts, a budding conservationist who’d been working with elephants in Nepal’s Chitwan National Park. He wasn’t formally trained, but Roberts had a promising vision of sustainable elephant tourism. Instead of buying the elephants outright, for instance, Anantara leases them on a permanent basis; itdiscourages locals from snaring another animal in hopes of a big payout.
Fifteen years later, the resort has become a globally recognized standard-bearer for responsible wildlife tourism and one of the only options in Thailand for conscientious travelers who want face time with pachyderms. In 2006, Anantara created a sibling property next door at the Four Seasons Tented Camp—a more posh and colonial-inspired, if slightly less elephant-obsessed, experience.
A third camp is on its way this fall, on a 44,000-acre conservancy Minor Hotels has pieced together in the Cardamom Mountains of Thailand and Cambodia. This resort will support an initiative to rehabilitate and rerelease native species such as the Asiatic wild dog, black bear, and clouded leopard into the wild.
Some animal rights advocates say the line should be drawn at looking, not touching, and it’s an argument that’s intensified in recent months. One video making the rounds on Facebook, posted in February by Unilad Adventures, an online travel community with 1.7 million followers, begins with a warning about graphic content. “Thinking about riding elephants in Thailand?” the minute-long video asks in block letters as a melancholic violin plays. It then shows baby elephants chained to posts, workers kicking the gargantuan animals as tourists struggle to climb onto them, and trainers prodding their thick hides with long, crude pickax-type tools.
A 2010 study by the University of Oxford’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit exposed Thai elephant camps as some of the travel industry’s most irresponsible businesses—not only for their poor treatment of the animals on their premises but also for encouraging locals to kidnap calves, some less than a year old, from their mothers and force them into submission.
By 2014 influential travel operators such as Intrepid Travel had removed elephant rides from their offerings. Mass petitions from World Animal Protection and Change.org rang up tens of thousands of signatures in a matter of days, encouraging more than 100 travel companies, including slower adopters such as Thomas Cook Travel, to nix the rides from their itineraries.
By the time Unilad posted its video, travel junkies were primed to react with disgust. To date, the video has gotten almost 17 million views and about 400,000 shares on Facebook, along with 17,000 mostly horror-struck comments. “I wish I hadn’t contributed to this,” one user wrote.
But in Africa, where poaching is the greatest danger facing elephants, travel has actually proved a strong engine for their conservation. Outfitters such as Singita are on the front lines of the issue, and Wilderness Safaris’ Abu Camp in Botswana’s Okavango Delta rehabilitates injured and orphaned elephants and reintroduces them to the wild.
For Southeast Asian elephants, the big threat isn’t poaching but indentured servitude. Roughly 30 percent of Asia’s 40,000 to 50,000 elephants are in captivity, often working under dangerous circumstances in forestry or performing in the street.
The region’s legacy of elephant labor goes back 3,000 years. The tradition is so old, the Arthashastra, an ancient text that guided Indian kings in the first millennium B. C., gave instructions regarding the health of the forests where elephants lived.
Among mahouts, the once-respected class of people who work with elephants, fathers teach their sons how to manage the animals, the way a rancher takes care of horses. But elephants are far more difficult to keep: They can eat 450 pounds of food a day—mostly bananas, vegetables, and grasses.
Considering how many elephants are still in captivity, “it’s extremely difficult to come up with workable and elephant-friendly solutions,” says Roberts, now the group director of conservation and sustainability at Anantara. Outside of the resort, he helps run the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation and a program in Southeast Asia that teaches mahouts a gentler training technique focusing on positive reinforcement. In February he was in Myanmar working on legislation that would outlaw the capture of wild elephants.
At breakfast on the third day, we’re joined by a 5-year-old elephant named Pang Luck, who regularly takes her morning meal in the company of guests on the restaurant terrace. After we eat yogurt parfaits with fresh passion fruit and local honey, we give her handfuls of tiny bananas. Using the two pointed “fingers” at the end of her trunk, she sucks the fruit out of our hands, peels it against her teeth, then helps her mahout clean up the discarded peels.
Like most of the 22 elephants here, Pang Luck’s short life has seen its share of tragedy. She was rescued from street performing, where she was patted and prodded in exchange for pocket change until the age of 3. Bounma, a fiftysomething elephant with a broken ear and distinguishing white hairs at the tip of her tail, was ill-suited for logging and spent years being badly beaten as a result; her owner took her begging until he gained admittance to join Anantara’s community.
When an elephant is accepted, Anantara also hires the animal’s mahout to train and care for it, employment that includes housing, health insurance, and education for his children. There are also opportunities for women to join a traditional silk-weaving collective.
A two-minute drive brings us to the Dara Camp, where most of the elephants “on duty” are relaxing in a series of open-air, canopied stables. One by one the giant creatures amble toward us, perhaps not gracefully but with intention. Poonlarp wags her tail and bats her long lashes. Dah, who survived on the streets of Bangkok and Pattaya before coming to Anantara, waves her ears back and forth nearby. Bo, the largest female of the herd, stretches her jaw open for the on-site veterinarians, who reward her with handfuls of sunflower seeds after a successful oral checkup.
Elephants’ memory has been the subject of much mythology—the animals never forget, right? Absolute proof of that bit of conventional wisdom remains elusive, but over the past decade, scientists have confirmed that elephants exhibit a rare level of animal intelligence. They’re capable of solving simple puzzles and benefit from regular mental stimulation; like chimpanzees, they use tools in the wild, usually to shoo away flies. They collaborate with one another when problems arise; they flinch when they see a herd member get hurt; they mourn their dead. Elephants are capable of getting angry with one another and then reconciling. It takes only a week for them to learn a command, such as baen (turn) or toi (back up), and they’re capable of mastering as many as 70 of them.
Spend even a little time with them, and you’ll see it for yourself. One night we eat dinner above an elephant playpen, while below, Pumpui, who’s 50-ish, affectionately wraps her trunk around Dah’s body, like a human giving a one-armed squeeze of a hug. Later we look up at the gleaming tusks and towering proportions of Phuki, a 4-ton tusker and one of the resort’s two male residents. I offer a scoop of sunflower seeds. His muddy trunk-fingers grip onto my hand and, gently but with a formidable whooooosh!, the seeds are gone.
Family suites at Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp & Resort start from $1,707 per night, including meals, limousine transfers to and from the airport, high-speed Wi-Fi, and Dara Camp elephant experience.",0
"The Theater That Had A Play With Trump’s Assassination In It Gets A Fresh $100,000 Grant!
The Theater That Had A Play With Trump’s Assassination In It Gets A Fresh $100,000 Grant!
The Public Theater in New York has gotten an astonishing $100,000 grant from the federal government, immediately after the scandal of doing a Julius Caesar production where a Donald Trump character gets assassinated.
Merely days following the scandal with the evident Trump character getting assassinated, the National Endowment for the Arts disclosed its freshest grants. The Public Theater got no less than $100,000 for its New York Shakespeare Festival.
Concretely now, the theater will do performances of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. “Performances will take place outdoors at Central Park’s Delacorte Theater, bringing together a diverse audience with renowned classical performers and young, emerging actors of all backgrounds and experience,” as seen on the June 14 grant announcement.
The NEA refused to confirm that any prior funding was poured into the production of Julius Caesar, however stated, “In the past, the New York Shakespeare Festival has received project-based NEA grants to support performances of Shakespeare in the Park by the Public Theater.”
Even though the government is not staying clear from the theater following the scandal, different corporate sponsors have done so. Bank of America and Delta Airlines withdrew funding after the publishing of the vivid pictures from the play.
“I wonder how much of this ‘art’ is funded by taxpayers?” questioned Donald Trump Jr. via Twitter.
The taxpayer disclosure group OpenTheBooks.com revealed that the New York Shakespeare Festival, which is the parent company of the Public Theater, has gotten almost $30 million in federal, state, and city grants from back in 2009.
Corey Stoll, the actor who played Marcus Brutus, took the play’s side and said that it used a Trump character in a form of “nuanced” art.
The actors and actresses were “exhausted and nervous” and pulled back saddened after the play triggered counter protests from Trump supporters who stopped performances.

"Caving in to the demands of the politically correct chubby community, Facebook has removed the “feeling fat” emoticon from its status menu.
In a statement Facebook said, “we’ve heard from our community that listing ‘feeling fat’ as an option for status updates could reinforce negative body image, particularly for people struggling with eating disorders … so we’re going to remove ‘feeling fat’ from the list of options. We’ll continue to listen to feedback as we think about ways to help people express themselves on Facebook.”
Activists associated with the group Endangered Bodies launched multiple Change.org petitions in late February as part of a campaign tied to National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. Their goal was to persuade Facebook to remove the “feeling fat” option, represented by a smiling emoticon with puffed-up and rosy cheeks. Fat is not a feeling, these activists said — and offering such an option could be especially problematic for people who struggle with eating disorders.
“When Facebook users set their status to ‘feeling fat,’ they are making fun of people who consider themselves to be overweight, which can include many people with eating disorders,” wrote Catherine Weingarten, a 24-year-old Ohio student who launched the U. S. version of the petition. “That is not ok. Join me in asking Facebook to remove the ‘fat’ emoji from their status options.”
Following Facebook’s announcement, Weingarten told Change.org in a statement: “As someone who struggled with body image, I feel so happy that I am eliminating one form of body shaming hatred on the internet.”
By Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. petition had more than 16,000 signatures — and the emoticon was gone from Facebook.",1
"I talk a lot about how cars look and sound.
For me, a deepappeal of the luxury automobile lies in the way it speaks to you through your senses, and also what it communicates to the rest of the world. So lately, after having driven an impressive collection of incredible V12 engine cars, which surge with power and cutting-edgetechnology underneath your feet, I began to think about all the energy that went into designing everything else that makes them great. The perfectly-crafted mirrors. The thunking doors. The headlights that can either flirt, or threaten.
Could I decide which of these incredible beasts was the most beautiful? Was it Ferrari’s 789-horsepower 812 Superfast and GTC4Lusso? Roll-Royce’s 624-hp Wraith, or 563-hp Dawn? (Rolls has many 12-cylinder offerings, but I'm thinking of cars with a certainvisual panache here.) Lamborghini’s 740-hp Aventador? Bentley’s 633-hp Continental GT?
These cars are as varied in their styling as they are in their on-road personality. Where the stylish, extravagant 812 flaunts itself around corners like a supermodel, the bulging body-builder Bentley punches forward like a heavyweight boxer. The Wraith is handsome, confident, and sure, an automotive Jason Statham.TheAventador, all geometric edges and screaming fury, is by far the wildest of the lot over any road configuration. Theyrange in price from roughly $200,000 for the Continental GT to $320,000 and up for the Superfast and the two Rolls. (And even those prices are rough estimates; virtually every person who owns them chooses customizations and options that make the price as bespoke as the car.)
And yet none, to me, are the most perfectly proportioned and stylishly designed. That title belongs to the Aston Martin DB11.
That the DB11 is beautiful* is no news. Since it made its debut last year, the $230,345 coupe has won critical and popular worship as a masterpiece. Somehow the folks at Aston figured out how to make the four-wheeled equivalent of Michelangelo’s David: curved across its clamshell hood, muscled along the side haunches, edged across its bladed 20-inch diamond-turned rims and casually potent, from the slender veins of his feet to the curled locks on his brow.
Er, from the new wide front grill to the rear aero blade and deployable spoiler, I mean. I’m talking about the car.
Anyway, photos don’t do (either piece of art) justice. But what I would like to offer for your consideration is the idea that this four-seater is the most capital-B ""Beautiful""12-cylinder car on the market today. Even sweeter: It’s fairly priced, when compared withthe others in its class.
Aston Martin chief Andy Palmer has said multiple times that his goal is to make the most beautiful cars in the world. In an industry that produces such complex, expensive products, it’s not a crazy thing to say, but it’s also nonstandard. Usually it’s the power of a car, the handling, and the performance that a carmaker brags about first. But Palmer is refreshing in his single-mindedness. Over more than a decade that I've beenwriting about cars, he’s the only automotive executive I’ve heard say point-blank that looks are his top priority.
He understands that beauty commands action and form follows function. A beautiful-looking car, in theory though not always in reality, will drive beautifully, too.
The DB11 epitomizes Palmer’s goal. This car will elicit feelings in you that will go unprinted here. Here, masculine (the huge, snarling air intakes in the roof) and feminine (the svelte side body) combine in the DB11 better than in any other modern car.
Its lateral-rung grille, spread long and low across the front, is a totally new look for Aston, as is the soft clamshell style hood and those cool rims bladed like the knives of a sushi master. New also are the full LED headlights slanted seductively along the front; their beams can even corner along with the road as the car moves forward. If there is a car that could make something like the good-looking Jaguar F-Type look stubby, this is it.
What’s more, and unlike some others in its segment (Lamborghini Huracán, ahem) visibility and road clearance aren’t sacrificed for looks. In the DB11, you can both see potholes and clear them.
Better yet, unlike many supercars, here the interior is as deluxe and well thought-out as the exterior.
To recreate the $255,000 DB11 I drove will cost roughly $20,000 in cosmetic upgrades. (That’s just on the inside.) Sitting in this cabin is like sitting inside a beautiful blond-leather Birkin bag—it smells like the inside of a Birkin, too, with a feel as soft to the touch as the calfskin in the Wraith, which costs nearly twice as much. You’ll want to spring for the warm blond interior tone called All Sahara Tan and make sure the top of the ceiling matches the seat insets as well ($2,270). You’ll also need the brogue detailing on the doors ($2,270)—richer than I’ve seen on a new car, swirled in hue like Turkish coffee and milk.
The contrast stitching ($570) and intricate quilted design splayed like fans across the top of the seats and the ceiling ($2,270) are great. They are a welcome change from the diamond-stitched designs that have become ubiquitous in cars of this caliber over the past few years. A “Satin Tan Lace Wood” trim inlay ($500) and gloss black speakers ($920) help complete the look. Consider it your own personal blonde calfskin cocoon.
Those familiar with this brand will be delighted with other interior upgrades from past Aston Martin models as well. Instead of starting the car by inserting a sleek key fob into the dashboard, the DB11’s fob simply must be in proximity to the car to activate the push-button start. The interior lights illuminate by touch, and a large storage compartment in the center console slides open and closed at the flick of a tiny lever in the center console.
On the dash, a single round LCD dial in the middle of a 12-inch screen tells speeds and engine status. You can see which of the three drive modes you’ve engaged there as well.
And the back, well, it’s smaller than what you’ll find in the four-seat, four-door Aston Martin Rapide. It’s far more beautiful, though, with the same fanned-out stitching and lush leather wrapping you at every turn. It’ll just require a pronounced hunch and knee swivel to the side for any adult to sit among its charms.
As for performance, well, this column is about beauty. But it’s worth saying that in the DB11, precision and personality cohabitate flawlessly, as in a driver’s dream.
Where something like the McLaren 570S masters precision, and the Lamborghini Huracán givespersonality, each are rather weighted to one end of that spectrum or the other. Meanwhile, DB11 is smooth and balanced, and fast, and powerful.
The proof is in the sales, which have far exceeded expectations:Aston Martin says demand for the DB11 will push company revenue up by 37 percent this year. In the fourth quarter alone last year, orders for the coupe rose 48 percent, according to a company statement in February. It's a strong step forward for the company that says it wants to introduce a new car into the market every nine months until 2020.
The DB11 makes 600 horsepower and hits 62 mph in 3.9 seconds. Top speed is 200 mph. Driving it feels as balanced as a metronome: You can get the back end to swivel a bit when you punch the gas (I like that), but the car quickly rights itself and grabs the road for more. You know how your favorite crazy uncle hugs you after a long time apart? Like that. It won’t let up.
Stability, traction, and torque control make the DB11 truly nimble to drive. One note: The brakes can feel extremely aggressive. Abrupt, even, if you haven’t yet warmed up and worked in the car.
Will you care? No. You’ll have already been seduced.
* This article assumes the existence ofthe concept philosophers call Objective Beauty, which arguesthat Beauty is an absolute and rational concept just like any other. Plato and Aristotle are in my camp. If you believe beauty is always relative, we canagree to disagree. Talk to me afteryou've driven this car.",0
"Scientists are re-evaluating their understanding ofthe earliest modern humans and theirmigration around the globe, after the discovery of forty seven teeth, labelled as “unequivocally” belonging to ‘Homo sapiens,’ in a cave in southern China.
They are between 80,000 to 120,000 years-old and suggest early humans migrated out of Africa to east Asia and shunned the easier path to Europe, because of stiff competition from the formidable ‘Neanderthals’ who already occupied parts of the continent and fiercely defended its resources.
The earliest discovery of modern humans in Europe dates back 45,000 years just before the fall of the Neanderthals around 40,000 years ago.
“This is stunning, it’s major league,” Michael Petraglia, an archeologist at the University of Oxford, U. K., who was not involved in the research that led to the discovery and eventual dating of the teeth, told Nature. “It’s one of the most important finds coming out of Asia in the last decade.”
Current theories suggest that our species — the Homo sapiens — evolved in Africa approximately 200,000 years ago. Prior to the latest discovery, which was made in a cave in Daoxianin southern China, scientific evidence suggested that our ancestors began colonizing the world only around 60,000 years ago. Older traces of modern humans previously discovered outside Africa, such as the roughly 100,000-year-old remains from the Skhul and Qafzeh caves in Israel, were discarded by scientistsas evidence of unsuccessful efforts at wider migration.
The teeth challenge this theory, raising doubts over the timing of the first migration out of Africa. The findings may also mean that our ancestors arrived in Asia and Europe in multiple waves.
“This is a rock-solid case for having early humans — definitelyHomo sapiens — at an early date in eastern Asia,” Chris Stringer, apaleoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London, who was not part of the research,told Nature.
Additionally, the findings also raise questions over why modern humans seemed to have reached Asia much before their migration to Europe, where the earliest such remains found are approximately 45,000 years old.
A possibility is that Homo sapiens faced stiff competition over resources from the Neanderthals who had already populated parts of Europe, and they could only enter the continent when the Neanderthals were at the brink of extinction.
“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Petraglia told Nature. “There’s a lot more work that needs to be done.”",1
"Diego and Rogelio said working as third-shift janitors at the Farm Fresh Foods chicken processing plant meant breathing bleach fumes for so long they couldn’t sleep afterwards for the headaches. Then there was the chicken itself.
The pair, who asked that their real names be withheld, told the Guardian their story by phone through a translator provided by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which filed a complaint earlier this year on behalf of the men with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) over the conditions at the Guntersville, Alabama, facility, owned by a local accountant named Eddie Hill.
Osha fined the company $30,000 last week for mistreating its employees and referred their complaints about having to handle raw chicken after cleaning the bathrooms to the US Department of Agriculture. Experts say worker abuse pervades the poultry industry, but the monitoring situation is likely to get worse under Donald Trump’s administration.
Trump has picked Charles Herbster, who runs a large “multi-level marketing” agricultural supply business called Conklin, to run his agriculture advisory committee. Andy Puzder, the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr executive who has campaigned against minimum wage rises, is Trump’s nominee for labor secretary. Workplace reforms in the agriculture business seem unlikely to come from regulators under Trump, to put it mildly.
The Farm Fresh Foods workers described retaliation from their supervisors when they complained, unsanitary conditions and being forced to race each other on a floor covered in standing water and chicken fat. And while the particulars may differ across processing plants, the chicken industry is rife with mistreatment.
Because employees at chicken processing plants are often undocumented, they’re less likely to complain about wage theft and illegal restrictions on bathrooms – a favorite tactic of processors trying to make their facilities more efficient, according to the SPLC.
An Oxfam America report issued in May called No Relief focused entirely on workers not being allowed to go to the toilet. It includes stories of laborers who said they were forced to wear diapers on the job because the penalties for taking too long in the bathroom were so severe. An SPLC report focused specifically on Alabama noted that nearly 80% of 300 workers surveyed said they had been denied bathroom breaks.
Because the facility did not have adequate drainage to disperse what the SPLC’s Isabel Otero described as “an enormous amount of Clorox” and no ventilation for its fumes, Diego and Rogelio’s eyes watered, their chests hurt, and they went for a full night and sometimes the rest of the following day without rest from the pain after the weekend cleanings, they said. They also said their supervisors would often wait outside while bleach fumes filled the room.
Minor Sinclair, head of Oxfam America, said he believes the chicken industry puts public opinion and working conditions last and simply focuses on maximizing profit. “In some ways it’s a backward-looking industry,” he said. Poultry companies tend not to care about brand identity, and they carefully guard their connections to suppliers who do. In general, they are run by “animal science guys”, Sinclair said. “They think about protein, the price of feed and bird weight.”
Labor unionization in the US south lags behind every other area of the country, and poultry producers tend to have very little to do with the public – Farm Fresh has no corporate website, only a Facebook page with the phrase “Yo Cresta En Esta Familia” (“I believe in this family”) written on a red heart as its cover photo, in English and Spanish – Spanish first. There are many photos of smiling Hispanic men and women celebrating birthdays and holidays, more like a church or a community center than a workplace. Recruitment information is posted in English and Spanish. Diego and Rogelio did not disclose their immigration status.
But labor advocates can bring pressure to bear on large and public outfits such as Tyson and Perdue, Oxfam’s Sinclair said, especially when government procurement is involved, and when those advocates aren’t hobbled by right-to-work laws like Alabama’s, which prevent unions from functioning. “The Los Angeles County school district turned down a $20m contract to Tyson,” Sinclair said. “They didn’t renew from Tyson, they went with another company [Canada’s Gold Star Foods],” Sinclair said. Tyson and Perdue are both cited in Oxfam’s report on the industry’s grim bathroom facilities, though neither company was accused of adulterating its product.
Producers similar in size to Farm Fresh are sometimes asked to help fulfill contracts for the bigger players when the latter need to overproduce. “Our hope is that Tyson is going to raise the floor for everybody; right on the eve of our report they raised wages for 34,000 [workers] to $10 an hour,” Sinclair said. “These are tough jobs – it’s like The Jungle! It’s still not fair compensation. But it’s a hell of a lot better than $8 an hour. That’s about a $100m payroll rise.”
When the men were done cleaning the floor of the plant and what they described as inadequate toilet facilities – four toilets in total for the hundreds who worked there – the complaint states that their supervisor made them race each other across a floor slick with “standing water accumulated and mixed with chicken fat” to perform their final duty of the midnight-to-7am shift: cutting raw chicken to size.
The workers tried to tell their bosses that they had been hired to clean the floors, not cut the chicken, but were rebuffed. “The company would tell us that this was the rule,” he said, “that we had to deal with the chicken, and that we had no choice but to do this job.” Several workers complained, said Rogelio, and their supervisor suspended them.
“We always would tell the manager that we should not be handling the chicken after doing this work with the same hands,” Diego said.
Their story might never have come to light if the company had not initially refused to pay them their final checks, prompting the initial complaint, the pair told the Guardian. They were paid after the SPLC intervened on their behalf, they said. “Wage theft is common in the poultry industry,” wrote the authors of another Oxfam America report on chicken processing.
The Guardian attempted to contact several people associated with Farm Fresh Foods, including Mark Welborne, general manager of the facility. Welborne did not return calls for comment.
The Guardian was able to reach Hill himself through the office of his accounting firm, prior to the $30,000 fine. Hill was aware of the complaint. He advised the Guardian to trust the judgment of the regulator: “Wait till the Osha investigation comes out,” he said. “The Osha investigation either will [fine] us or it will clear us.”
Pressed on the specific complaints, Hill said: “You’re not going to get an answer out of me.”
“I have a sense of what’s right and wrong,” Hill said. Asked what that sense told him, he said: “I’m going to let Osha decide.” Hill hung up.
The Guardian called Hill again after the fine had been levied to ask for further comment; he said, “I have no comment.” The line was disconnected before the Guardian could ask further questions.

"Why are democrats so opposed to Trumps new tax reform? The real reason isn’t because it’s a “tax break for the rich” as they all say, it’s because democratic law makers have a system in place right now, one they call the “sacred cow”, that protects their own pockets and don’t want the status quo to change.
One provision of the Republican’s tax-cutting plan that has drawn intense opposition from Democrats is the elimination of state and local tax deductions for those who itemize.
Rep. Nancy Pelosi said it was “an insidious effort to raise taxes on middle class families … across America.” Sen.Ron Wydensaid that “hardworking middle-class folks are not going to appreciate Congress double taxing them.” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called it “a pure tax increase.”
What exactly are democrats trying so hard to protect?
It’s called a SALT deduction, and it will cost the federal government $1.8 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation.
And the benefits goalmost entirely to upper-income families.
Fewer than 22% of tax filers even claim the state and local tax deduction, and the vast majority of these are higher-income families. While 78% of those with incomes above $200,000 claim the deduction, just 7% of those making between $30,000 and $40,000 do. For most taxpayers, the standard deduction is more valuable.
The Joint Committee on Taxation calculates that for those earning more than $200,000, the SALT deduction cuts their federal tax bill by an average $6,295. For those with incomes of between $100,000 and $200,000, it’s just $857. Those earning from $30,000 to $40,000 get an average of $93 off their federal tax bill.
These numbers are absurd and impossible to defend. How can the democrats have any bone to pick with Trumps new tax plan, which has been proven to help working class families, when they stand behind this plan, which is doing nothing for the working class man.
Why are democrats so opposed to Trumps new tax reform? The real reason isn’t because it’s a “tax break for the rich” as they all say, it’s because democratic law makers have a system in place right now, one they call the “sacred cow”, that protects their own pockets...",1
"According to research from Imperial College London, a large analysis of current research shows that people who eat at least 20g (3/4 oz) of nuts a
day have a lower risk of heart disease, cancer and other diseases. But there’s more to this story than meets the eye.
The analysis of all current studies on nut consumption and disease risk has revealed that 20g a day – equivalent to a handful or 0.75 oz – can cut people’s risk of coronary heart disease by nearly 30 percent, their risk of cancer by 15 percent, and their risk of premature death by 22 percent.
An average of at least 20g of nut consumption was alsoassociatedwith a reduced risk of dying from respiratory disease by about a half, and diabetes by nearly 40 percent, although the researchers note that there is less data about these diseases in relation to nut consumption.
The study, led by researchers from Imperial College London and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, is published in the journalBMC Medicine.
The research team analysed 29 published studies from around the world that involved up to 819,000 participants, including more than 12,000 cases of coronary heart disease, 9,000 cases of stroke, 18,000 cases of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and more than 85,000 deaths.
While there was some variation between the populations that were studied, such as between men and women, people living in different regions, or people with different risk factors, the researchers found that nut consumption was associated with a reduction in disease risk across most of them.
Study co-author Dagfinn Aune from the School of Public Health at Imperial said:
In nutritional studies, so far much of the research has been on the big killers such as heart diseases, stroke and cancer, but now we’re starting to see data for other diseases.
“We found a consistent reduction in risk across many different diseases, which is a strong indication that there is a real underlying relationship between nut consumption and different health outcomes. It’s quite a substantial effect for such a small amount of food.
The study included all kinds of tree nuts, such as hazel nuts and walnuts, and also peanuts – which are actually legumes. The results were in general similar whether total nut intake, tree nuts or peanuts were analysed.
What makes nuts so potentially beneficial, said Aune, is their nutritional value:
Nuts and peanuts are high in fiber, magnesium, and polyunsaturated fats – nutrients that arebeneficial for cutting cardiovascular disease risk and which can reduce cholesterol levels.
“Some nuts, particularly walnuts and pecan nuts are also high in antioxidants, which can fight oxidative stress and possibly reduce cancer risk. Even though nuts are quite high in fat, they are also high in fiber and protein, and there is some evidence that suggests nuts might actually reduce your risk of obesity over time.
The fat in nuts are a beneficial type of fat including omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids – other fatty acids, too.Natural Blazewould like to point out that this is only anassociation– nothing more. There is no direct link here. Onehealth news watch grouppoints out that association is the same as correlation which is not the same as causation. Fair point even though nuts have a lot of unrealized compounds and make enjoyable, satiable snacks. You can get the best benefits by soaking them overnight first to neutralize thephytic acidthat blocks nutrient absorption.Soaking prevents this problem.

"President Trump executive order to end federal funding to theCorporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) — which, in turn, supports National Public Radio (NPR) and Public Broadcasting Service(PBS) got the approval of the people. However, the democrats are up in arms over Trump’s proposed budget cuts.
The left ishowling, and local public radio stations are alreadycampaigning to oppose the move. Democrats are spamming supporters with fundraisingemails.
Let’s take for examplePBS and NPR. We all know that PBS and NPR have turned into voices of the socialist progressives. The last thing on their mind is the people that made America great or American patriotism.
But,you will be shocked when you discover what PBS and NPR executive make. PBS pays their president, Paula Kerger, a $632,233 yearly salary. CEO Gary Knell received $956,513!
No one receiving any kind of Federal Funding should make that much money!
Former Senator Jim DeMint said it up perfectly: “When presidents of government-funded broadcasting are making more than the president of the United States, it’s time to get the government out of public broadcasting.”
While executives at the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) are raking in massive salaries, the organizations are participating in an aggressive lobbying effort to prevent Congress from saving hundreds of millions of dollars each year by cutting their subsidies.
The so-called commercial free public airwaves have been filled with pleas for taxpayer cash. Hundreds of taxpayer-supported TV, radio and Web outlets have partnered with an advocacy campaign to facilitate emails and phone calls to Capitol Hill for the purpose of telling members of Congress, “Public broadcasting funding is too important to eliminate!”
Face it!! The president’s decision to defund PBS is a smart one! The employees salaries are way too high, at the expense of hardworking taxpayers! The taxpayers helped launch NPR and PBS. It is well past time to let them go. We are refusing to pay American Tax Dollars to Channels that are only giving one side of the story.
If these organization should be funded then they should useprivate money, do fundraising, seek donations, and hire volunteers to staff when appropriate. It’s that simple. It isn’t the government’s job to be using tax money to fund any organization or entity that isn’t essential to government operation and doesn’t fall within the constitutional limits of power that our founders placed on the federal government. Constraints that have been ignored for far too long and have lead to tax money being used to fund lots of things that should not be tax payer funded.",1
"The accompanying chart contains the strongest of language. A milder version can be found here.
FEW corners of the internet are more likely to celebrate the news of another royal baby than Mumsnet. Users of the parenting website, founded in 2000, welcomed last week’s announcement with a flurry of excited messages and grinning emojis.
But not everyone was happy. One user, named “QuimJongUn”, bemoaned the fact that the same “fuckwits” who “spout their Daily Mail bullshittery” about benefit-claiming mothers are the same “wankwads” who will fawn over the baby when it is born. Other Mumsnetters agreed, in the strongest of terms.
Such streams of expletives are causing trouble for Mumsnet. On August 19th the Times reported that sponsors were threatening to pull adverts from the website. Among them were Confused.com, a price-comparison site, the National Trust, a conservation charity and Bulgari, a luxury jeweller. The organisations are reportedly wary of being associated with increasingly foul-mouthed mothers. Are they right to worry?
To answer this question, The Economist examined over 200,000 discussion threads from one of Mumsnet’s most popular forums. We looked for instances of the words that Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, deems offensive. The analysis does not capture every curse. Some mums choose to self-censor; others use knowing acronyms (CF, for instance, means “cheeky fucker”). Nevertheless, a clear trend emerges from the number-crunching: swearing is indeed on the rise.
The occurrences of what Ofcom deems the “strongest” language (think C-words and F-bombs) have tripled since 2008. Terms which it considers “strong” and “medium” have also increased, at a slower pace. This appears to be at the expense of “milder” cursing (such as “God” and “bloody”), the prevalence of which has declined by a quarter.
Unsurprisingly, nothing gets online mums more riled up than talking about their relationships. Much of this is venting about husbands’ emotional distance, flagging libido or adulterous tendencies. By contrast, debates about the book of the month elicit, on the whole, much milder language.",0
"How much house can you buy for $850,000?
At more than four times the national median home value, which is currently $201,900 according to Zillow, these are homes and buildings where upgraded amenities are the norm. It's uncommon to find a home at this price point that doesn't have hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances and high-quality kitchen countertops. They also often come with spa-like master bathrooms, large guest suites and ample storage.
Of course, as usual with real estate, what you get at this price point depends entirely on the location. In midsize cities like Atlanta, $850,000 could buy 4,432 square feet and a professionally landscaped property. In larger metro areas like New York City, a buyer with that budget could find 750 square feet in a building with an elevator and a 24-hour doorman.

"The adoption of a new policy makes US Soccer the first American professional sports league to require all players to stand during the playing of the Star Spangled Banner.
The policy was created after a female soccer player took a knee during the national anthem at several matches last season in support of NFL football player Colin Kaerpernick, who refused to stand for the anthem in protest of a culture of oppression that targets African Americans.
Last fall, Megan Rapinoe of the US Women’s National Soccer Team followed the San Francisco 49’ers quarterback’s lead and refused to stand during the traditional game opening recitation of the national anthem.
In response, the league’s governing body has announced that it has adopted a new policy requiring all players to stand for the anthem or face undisclosed penalties.
In a statement, released on the social media platform Twitter, former pro soccer player Stuart Holden posted a screenshot of the new rule, passed on February 9, that said:
“All persons representing a Federation National Team shall stand respectfully during the playing of national anthems at any event in which the Federation is represented.”
In a comment accompanying the passage of the new rule, the organization released a statement:
“We have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor the flag while the national anthem is played.”
Kaepernick has become a lightning rod for the culture war raging in our nation. His solamn but resolute refusal to stand during the performance of the Star Spangled Banner at football games last year earned him both respect and contempt.
He began the silent protest in response to the increased level of law enforcement violence targeting people of color in the United States. While many have praised him for his stand, or at least acknowledged his right to make it, many others see it as one of the highest measures of disrespect and contempt for our nation, and have called for his dismissal from the San Francisco 49ers and from the NFL for his actions.
Kaepernick has said that he will stand for the playing of the anthem during the 2017-2018 NFL season.
This new rule for US Soccer makes it the first professional league to mandatorily require players to stand for the anthem or face penalties.
While the announcement does not specify what those penalties might be, Megan Rapinoe was left of the National Team’s roster for this season. This decision has some wondering if it might be what players can expect moving forward, thus instituting a sort of “blacklist.”
The Star Spangled Banner has been part of the opening ceremony of professional sports teams since the 1940’s. During that period, even team owners wondered if playing before every game lessened the impact, and it was not till the 1960s that it became standard practice. The first documented case of athletes using the national anthem as a means of protesting racist policies came at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics when the American gold and silver medalists in a sprint event bowed their heads and raised their fists during the medal ceremony. This became an iconic image for a generation struggling with racial justice in an ostensibly free country.

"BAYTOWN, Texas -- Asfloodwaters in Texas rose, so did gasoline prices -- all over the nation.
Since Friday, they're up 10 cents, to a nationwide average of $2.45 a gallon --the highest they've been all year.
The nation's largest oil refinery is waterlogged and shut down after Harvey ravaged Port Arthur, Texas.
* ""I don't have the words"": Woman returns to home hit by Harvey
More than a dozen refineries across the Gulf are closed, including those operated by ConocoPhillips outside Houston and Exxon Mobile in Baytown -- the nation's second largest. It normally pumps out 560,000 barrels of oil a day.
About a third of the nation's refining capacity is offline on the Gulf Coast.
John Hofmeister, former president of Shell Oil, weighed in on the current situation.
""Without it we'd be in gas lines all the time. We need that Gulf Coast,"" Hofmiester said.
""Best case: the refinery should be up and operating again for the most part by the middle of September. Worst case: some of those refineries -- if they're really seriously damaged -- they could be down through Thanksgiving or longer,"" he added.
The Houston area is a major hub for the energy industry.
A number of oil and gas installations were in Harvey's path -- and it's not just about the refineries.
The Colonial Pipeline runs to New York and provides nearly 40 percent of the South's gasoline. A portion of the pipeline in Texas was shut down and is expected to resume service Sunday.
The port of Houston remains closed to large vessels.
In addition, a huge backlog of ships is building off the coast as seen in the following map:
Experts warn fuel could soon be in short supply in the Midwest and Northeast. Already, long lines of people waiting for gas were showing up in Dallas, where some stations have run out.
Meanwhile, a billion barrels of oil will be released from a government stockpile and the secretary of the Department of Transportation will expedite fuel deliveries to Texas from 25 surrounding states. Some refineries are coming back online, but many have a long way to go.",0
"SOME time soon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems likely to break through the 20,000 barrier, an event that will be greeted with banner headlines and a sign that capitalism is flourishing again. In fact, the Dow is a flawed measure, which uses the odd approach of weighting its component companies by share price. The biggest stock in the Dow is Goldman Sachs and despite its prominence on the campaign trail (and among Donald Trump’s new team), it is hardly the most important company in America; its weight depends on its near-$240 share price. Like other financial shares, it has shot up in the wake of Mr Trump’s election; boosted both by hopes of bank deregulation and of potentially higher interest rates, which tend to boost bank profits. William Wright of New Financial estimates that Goldman staff's wealth, in the form of options and shares, has risen by $2.3bn since the polls; not exactly a ""revolt against the elite"".
The Dow is up 9% since November 7th, well ahead of the more broadly-based S&P 500’s 6.6% gain. The S&P uses a weighting by market value—its biggest stock is Apple which, like many other tech stocks, has seen far less of a boost from Mr Trump’s election. Apple only has the 11th biggest weight in the Dow.
Still, the American stockmarket rally since the election has been quite remarkable, given the qualms expressed by many investors before the election. The big hope is that Mr Trump will focus on his plans for fiscal stimulus and corporate tax-cutting; this will boost America’s economy and corporate profits. But it may also push up inflation so investors are switching out of Treasury bonds and into equities. At the same time, investors are counting on Mr Trump to forget about, or downplay, his protectionist rhetoric; as yet, they have been remarkably sanguine about his twitter wars with China.
In the past, the markets have sometimes taken a pause for breath after reaching Dow milestones (see chart). The average first reached 1,000 during the trading day in 1966 but did not close above that level until 1972; it then fell sharply and only reclaimed the 1,000 level 10 years later. The 10,000 market was reached during the 1990s tech boom. Although the average reached 11,000 in 1999, it suffered two big setbacks over the following decade, falling to 6,600 in March 2009. But by November that year, the average was back over 10,000 again and the records have kept coming; 15,000 was reached in May 2013, and 19,000 as recently as November 22 this year. (The authors who predicted, in separate books, that the Dow could reach 36,000 or even 100,000 have yet to be vindicated.)
Any investor buying into the market at the current level needs to be aware that a fair degree of good news is in the price. The S&P 500 is trading on an historic price-earnings ratio, relative to last year’s profits, of 21; it has spent the vast bulk of the last 90 years trading below that level. Use the average profits over the last 10 years, a method popularised by Robert Shiller of Yale, and the ratio is 28.3, nearly 70% above the long-term average. Relative to book or asset value, share prices trade on a ratio of 3, a more modest 25% above the long-run average. The dividend yield of 2% is well below the historic average; on the other had, investors may feel this is perfectly respectable relative to the tiny yield on cash and the 2.44% available on 10-year Treasury bonds; after all, they can hope for dividend growth and share buy-backs especially if companies repatriate their overseas earnings.
The biggest threat to equities comes from two directions. The first is the Federal Reserve, it is expected to raise rates later today although, as a result of those expectations, that news must already be reflected in share prices. But if the Fed indicates a sustained period of rate increases, the markets may take fright. And the second risk is that Mr Trump’s stimulus falls short; it gets diluted in Congress or fails to have the anticipated effect (after all, the Japanese have been trying, and failing, to stimulate their economy for decades). Oddly enough, given the perceived pro-business policies of Republicans, the American market has performed much better under Democrat presidents.",0
"Vice President Mike Pence visited storm-stricken Texas on Thursday and said he is confident Congress will move quickly to approve immediate assistance in the wake of massive flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey.
""No Texan should doubt as they apply for available federal assistance, no small business or business that’s affected should doubt that this administration, this Congress will come together and make sure those resources are there,"" Pence said in Corpus Christi after surveying the damage.
Some 100,000 homes are estimated to have been affected by Harvey, which roared ashore as a Category 4 hurricane late Friday, causing damage along the Gulf coast and swamping the Houston area and eastern Texas with nearly 50 inches of rain in some places, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert said Thursday.
""That's a big number,"" Bossert said. A supplemental appropriations request to Congress will be made for funding, and the administration will then make a second request once more is known, he said.
At least 38 deaths have been blamed on the hurricane and its aftermath as of Thursday night. Patients at a hospital in Beaumont, east of Houston, were evacuated via helicopter Thursday. The city experienced widespread flooding. Rescues across the region continued.
Two Republican congressional sources told NBC News that the Trump administration is expected to send an initial request for at least $5.5 billion for aid, likely $5 billion for the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund and $500 million for a small business loan fund.
An administration source said this is ""in the ballpark"" and said there could be additional money added to the request. Two sources said the request could come as soon as Friday but might not be formally made until next week.
In Crosby, northeast of Houston, a flooded chemical plant exploded and more explosions were feared. The fire at the Arkema Inc. plant prompted evacuations of residents within a mile and a half of the facility.
The center of Harvey, now a tropical depression, was 30 miles northwest of Greenwood, Mississippi, as of 5 p.m. ET Thursday, but the National Hurricane Center said that flooding continued across far eastern Texas and western Louisiana.
Meanwhile, the storm could be the costliest natural disaster in the nation's history. Pence said that the recovery would likely take years. The storm's impact in the refinery-rich region was expected to cause gas prices to increase. Authorities in some Texas cities urged people not to panic about gasoline supplies.
Pence said that as of Thursday morning more than 311,000 people have registered for disaster assistance. He said more than $530 million in assistance has been distributed.
""The sheer magnitude of this storm, its impacts that we saw on the ground and from the air are not lost on anyone here,"" Pence said.
""The long term challenge here will be ... getting people back into communities and into their homes,” Pence said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has prepositioned some 2,000 manufactured homes and the government has ordered another 4,000, he said.
And Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday increased the number of National Guard troops called to help to 24,000. Bossert said that 28 search-and-rescue teams and task forces from 16 states have sent help to Texas.
""I believe that that’s the first time we’ve activated all the task forces since 9/11,"" Bossert said. He said that life-saving operations were continuing.
President Donald Trump has pledged to donate $1 million in personal funds for storm relief efforts, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. Trump visited Texas on Tuesday.
Pence, asked whether the Trump administration would seek offsets in budget cuts to pay for disaster relief funding, said that Trump’s “top priority right now is focusing on rescue and recovery efforts.”
""We’re going to be working very diligently and already have begun to work with the Congress to make sure that full resources to backstop those efforts, to provide for recovery and ultimately to provide for rebuilding communities that have been devastated by Hurricane Harvey is there,"" Pence said.
He said he would leave future decisions to Trump and Congress as the process moves forward.
Estimates are that around 200,000 customers were without power in Texas Thursday, 11,000 in Louisiana. In Beaumont, a main pump station and wells were flooded and around 120,000 people were without water, federal and local officials said.
In the city of Dickinson, southeast of Houston, residents began to return Wednesday, in some cases finding devastation. The town of around 19,000 had been under a mandatory evacuation order.
""This handle was the only thing sticking out of the water,"" Chris Rhoads, pointing to a ruined Harley Davidson motorcycle in his garage, told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth.
""When I left, the water was barely getting into the house. When I came back, it was waist-high,"" Rhoads said.",0
"Back in the 1990’s, then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich brought to light the fact that American taxpayers, through the National Endowment for the Arts, were paying for unhinged artists to create works of “art” likePiss Christ, a photograph in which acrucifix was submerged in the “artist”‘s own urine.
Thankfully, some oversight has been brought on these government agencies, although that appeared to have gone lax during the eight years that Democrat Barack Obama was in office.
TheWashington Free Beacon‘s Liz Harrington recently studied the budgets ofthe National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and found out that Americans are paying a liberal professor named Eric Mandlebaum to perform research on how Christians’ religious beliefs are somehow “irrational.”
TheNational Endowment for the Humanities is giving this City University of New York professor $50,000 to write a book titledPropaganda and Belief in the Modern World. In a 2015 paper, the professor expressed disbelief that“74% of American adults believe in God, 72% believe in miracles, 68% believe in heaven, 57% believe in the Virgin birth.”
He then added, as if it were a bad thing,“As of May 2014, 22-28% of Americans believe that the Bible is the actual word of God, and is to be takenliterallyword for word.” He then said, idiotically,“People hold shockingly irrational beliefs.” Do you think it’s awful Americans are giving money to a man who thinks we are “shockingly irrational” for being Christians?",1
"Everyone hopes to find a “rookie” card under their bed somewhere in an old shoe box, or maybe in their closet. But, few ever do. If you do happen to find one, consider yourself lucky. Here’s what you’ll want to know about these gems from the 1990s.
Some of the hottest football cards can be found online, but good luck getting your hands on them — like the 1995 select certified Terrell Davis card. There might be other cards more valuable, but in its heyday, this card was a staple in every collector’s sports card collection. David had the best four-year stretch to start his career in history. It was capped by winning the 1997 Super Bowl MVP and then becoming one of only a handful of players to rush for 2,000 yards in a season.
Today, he’s on the outside looking in, but it’s awesome that he’s got a chance to make Hall of Fame for such a short career. The card still commands an impressive $75 for a GM MT 10.
Authentic Randy Moss is the highlight of the 1990s. In 2 short years, he accounted for many of the highlights in the 90s at a very young age. He made an immediate impact on the league from the wide receiver position. This is not very common. While he does have a few other cards out there with more value, the 1998 SP Authentic stands out as a staple.
He’s earned a place amongst the greats and will likely be inducted into the Hall of Fame once he retires.
This card is as annoying as his retirement antics toward the end of his career. You couldn’t get rid of him. From that moment, Favre burst onto the scene with the Packers, this card was suddenly “everywhere.” It’s always been in strong demand, too. Whether you were opening packs in the 1990s or buying graded cards in the 2000s, Favre’s 1991 Stadium Club card was traded everywhere.
Thankfully, the supplemental set is a thing, because otherwise, we’d be stuck without a decent card for Emmitt Smith. A PSA 10 Emmitt Smith 1990 Score Supplement can fetch between $250 and $350. That’s really something for a card from the early 1990s. Regardless of the number of copies that exist out there, and whatever else happens to him, there’s only one Smith and he’ll always be a Cowboy.
This card might be one of the best of all-time. Peyton’s resurrection in Denver proves what we already knew: he’s a legend. For now, the card is worth a stunning $1,000, and $2,500 for a mint condition BGS 9.5
There are a lot of cards out there that don’t make the list. That doesn’t mean they’re worthless, but they’re also not as iconic. Regardless, if you have any of these cards, you probably know their worth. Now, tuck them back into their sleeve and return them to the fireproof safe you have buried in the back yard.

"Nothing is perfect, but the idea that a brand-new, 690-hp, $393,695 car that can go 217 miles per hour needs improvement is kind of ridiculous.
Nevertheless, that’s been the case with the Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 since it was brand-new in 2012.
Oh, it was always mind-bogglingly quick, glorious to listen to and astonishing to see, but the mid-engine flagship also had a clunky gearbox, a brittle ride and handling that was numb, at best. It may have been a supercar, but like all superheroes, it was flawed.
That didn’t stoptoo many well-to-dos from buying it. The superficial stuff still counts for a lot. But even Lamborghini admitted it could do better, and now it has – with a re-engineered, mid-engine two-door rechristened the Aventador S. It keeps all the good stuff – including the carbon fiber passenger cell, 6.5-liter V12 and alien attack ship styling – while it addresses the issues that have surely kept you up at night all these years.
It now has computer-controlled magnetorheological shock absorbers that befit a flagship. They soften or stiffen the suspension as needed, so it doesn’t feel like you’re pulling up to the club in a shopping cart anymore. (For most customers, that’s probably good enough.)
A bigger change is the addition of all-wheel-steering that uses actuators to steer the rear wheels in concert with the fronts, making the car nimbler and more stable.
Lamborghini isn’t the first to employ this technology, but it’s gone about it with its signature dramatic flair. At low speeds, the rear wheels turn up to 3 degrees in the opposite direction of the fronts – much more than any other all-wheel-steer car. It has the virtual effect of shrinking the wheelbase, which means it’s more eager to turn. The wheels move back and forth so much in this mode that they look broken.
Go faster, and the rear wheels start to turn in sync with the fronts – but only up to 1.5 degrees, which makes the Aventador S feel like it’s longer than it actually is, and less likely to spin into oblivion at triple-digit speeds.
There’s also a new front steering system with a variable ratio that constantly changes how far you have to turn the wheel and how heavy it feels, depending on how fast you’re driving and what mode (Strada, Sport, Corsa or the customizable EGO) is dialed in. The rear wing moves up and down, too.
If it sounds like there’s an ambitious amount of electro-mechanical juggling going on, there is. But the Aventador S is so good at it that it could win “Italia’s Got Talent.”
You have to be moving to enjoy it, though, and the massive naturally-aspirated V12 now has 730 hp to do that with. Launch control sends as much of the 507 lb-ft of torque through the Aventador S’ 10-inch-wide front and 14-inch-wide rear tires as it can, and gets the first quarter mile out of the way in 10.7 seconds, according to Lamborghini’s stopwatch.
And the faster you go, the quicker it feels. Once you get all those horses running, the Aventador S simply starts erasing distance. Being nearsighted is an issue behind the wheel of this car, because whatever blurry thing you’re trying to see down the road will soon be in your lap. If that happens to be a turn, get ready to grin.
I got to try the Aventador S at Pocono Raceway. Not on the high-speed oval, unfortunately, but on one of its flat, twisty infield road courses. The old understeering LP700-4 would’ve spent the entire time trying to mow the grass on the outside of the curves, but this one was more eager to hunt for apexes.
Paced by 2010 NASCAR rookie of the year Kevin Conway, who unexpectedly switched to racing Lamborghinis for a living, I drove it faster than I probably would have solo and found that it’s very happy to live on the edge. There’s nothing screwy at all about all that stuff happening between your hands and the tires.
The Aventador S feels connected, predictable and very light on its feet. I’d driven the $450,000 Ford GT, which is practically a race car, on a similar track just a few weeks earlier, and the much heavier Lamborghini wasn’t any less fun. Faced with a long drive home, it has the luxurious edge.
The price is now $417,000, but that extra 23 grand is money well spent. Yes, those numbers are as absurd to me as they are to 99.9 percent of you, but if you knock off a zero to put things in perspective, $2,300 would be a small amount to pay for change of this magnitude on a $39,000 car.
The only thing that left me wanting was that gearbox, a single-clutch, seven-speed robotized manual that’s starting to feel ancient but has been smoothed out a little. I like to think they didn’t completely fix it for the same reason some artists and artisans intentionally put mistakes in their work: Nothing can be perfect.
But the Aventador S is ridiculously good.",0
"Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has not had much success when it comes to acquiring brands and growing them as stand-alone retail operations.
The company has closed all of its Evolution Fresh juice bars, has shuttered its Boulange Bakery brand, and has plans to close its Teavana tea stand-alone stores. The Evolution Fresh and Teavana branding remain alive on packaged goods and in Starbucks stores while the Boulange brand has disappeared completely.
It's fair to say that the company failed to realize the plans it had for all three brands when it acquired them. At one point each of the three companies was slated to be a national, stand-alone retail brand. That, of course, did not work, but now Starbucks has a new plan for a second bakery brand that might finally get it right.
Instead of buying its new bakery brand, Starbucks has instead decided to license and invest in Princi, a ""boutique bakery, and café founded by Rocco Princi in 1986,"" according to a press release. The coffee chain won't own the brand.
Instead, it will work with other investors, which include Angel Lab and Pekepan Investments, along with Princi's founder to focus on growing the bakery's number of stand-alone restaurants. Princi will also be the exclusive food partner at the coffee company's Roastery and stand-alone Reserve locations.
This deal has been public for over a year, but Starbucks had not made any public moves with Princi. That will change this week when the bakery chain launches its first store inside a Starbucks at the company's Seattle Roastery the week of November 6.
""We have great plans for the high-end, artisanal bakery, Princi,"" said CEO Kevin Johnson during the chain's Q4 earnings call. ""Princi will be added in every Starbucks Reserve Roastery, including our extraordinary, 30,000 square-foot Shanghai Roastery opening next month, further elevating the culinary experience we offer customers.""
In addition, Starbucks plans to support the launch of ""a number of stand-alone Princi stores"" in the years ahead, the CEO added. Those locations won't carry Starbucks branding but will serve the company's Reserve coffees.

More:Starbucks sells Tazo tea brand to Unilever, focuses on Teavana instead
Teavana, Boulange Bakery, and Evolution Fresh were not failures or even unprofitable, but none of the three could deliver a return on investment that made pursuing the concept logical for Starbucks. As a publicly traded company the coffee chain must appease investors and, even though it has the means to continue growing these brands, sometimes its money is better spent elsewhere.
As a part owner of Princi, Starbucks does not face the same pressures. It can help the bakery company grow and profit from that, but it does not bear the ultimate responsibility for its success. In addition, by essentially outsourcing its higher-end food operations to a company with experience in that space, Starbucks can benefit from Princi instead of having to create on its own.
That's something which Chairman Howard Schultz explained in a press release when the deal was first announced.
""Rocco and his team at Princi possess a passion for handcrafted food and artisanal baked goods that mirrors how I feel about our coffee,"" he said. "" The attention to detail, the care invested in selecting the ingredients and the artistry of preparation is second only to the service Rocco offers customers inside his Princi stores.""
By investing in Princi, the company gets to have its cake and eat it too. It can benefit if the brand grows and becomes a large chain, but it also gets what it needs in the near-term when it comes to being able to offer an upscale bakery experience to support its Reserve and Roastery brands.

"But eyes wide open: Republicans aren't stalling the shutdown because they are working on thoughtful, bipartisan solutions to issues ranging from Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, to defense spending, to infrastructure to the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. In fact, in the words of one Republican representative earlier this week, the stalls are to sort through ""end-of-year drama"" among themselves. An obviously prudent use of taxpayer money.
Paul Ryan's plans for Medicare are scary
Let's not forget the President himself is promising to wrap and bestow a big, fat, tax-cut gift upon all Americans right in time for the eggnog. And, given the predicted final passage of the tax overhaul bill, congressional Republicans would not dare allow a shutdown to distract from the joint presidential-congressional gift to the people.
While this seems full of goodwill and angelically thoughtful -- it's not. This is about congressional Republicans needing to put a win on the board to avoid being wiped out in the midterm elections. And, while it may be true that I am a proponent of lowering taxes, the opportunism here just reeks.
My prediction is that at some point early in the new year, it's all going to come to a head. Congress is either going to pass a reasonable budget or the government will shut down.
The onus is squarely on the Republican White House and Congress, given their supermajority status, to extend the olive branch to Democrats and secure a viable spending bill. Sadly, I have little to no confidence -- given the superpartisan and intrapartisan fighting that we are witnessing these days -- that this will happen.
This is where it gets scary for Americans.
Joseph Ellis: GOP is trying to erase over 100 years of history
In terms of pure economics, when Congress stalls on budget deals, critical conversations regarding whether to raise the debt ceiling are overlooked, leading to potentially consequential problems. According to Beth Ann Bovino, the US chief economist for S&P Global, ""The impact of a default by the US government on its debts would be worse than the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, devastating markets and the economy."" Remember 2008? This actually would be devastating.
In terms of our Dreamers, failure to act will have real and dire consequences. Specifically, between March 6 and November 6, 2018, nearly 300,000 DACA recipients will be ripped out of the American workforce and denied the opportunity to contribute to the US economy. And without protection from deportation, nearly 800,000 Dreamers will become priorities for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For Dreamers, who were carried over the border by no fault of their own, this is a desperate time.
In terms of the 9 million children and 370,000 pregnant women who are insured by CHIP, their coverage is in jeopardy. Thanks to Congress for so responsibly allowing CHIP funding to expire in September, and with no budget deal in sight, most states are on track to run out of funding by March. As a single mother of twin boys, who is fortunate to be able to afford insurance, I can't imagine what it feels like to be on the other side.
And by the way, these words are not meant to be unnecessarily harsh on the GOP. I could have written a similar piece during the government shutdown of 2013, albeit under a Democratic White House and Democratic-controlled Senate.

"A class-action lawsuit filed against Wells Fargo last week might be hamstrung at the starting line, legal experts say.
Customers who had bank or credit card accounts opened in their name without their knowledge face an uphill battle even getting a court to hear their case because of mandatory arbitration contract clauses that protect banks from class-action suits, consumer advocates say.
“It’s going to be a serious obstacle,” said David Seligman, an attorney and contributor to the National Consumer Law Center. “These clauses are hidden in boilerplate contracts,” he said. “They often require you to bring disputes in to private arbitration, and almost always force you to bring them individually.”
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which spearheaded the regulatory action against the banking giant, has proposed rolling back the broad latitude that banks have granted themselves to settle disputes outside the legal system this way.
But that won't help these Wells Fargo customers.
“They’re going to come up against that arbitration clause,” said Amanda Werner, arbitration campaign manager for the Americans for Financial Reform and Public Citizen. “We see things like this all the time,” she said.
Five years ago, a Supreme Court ruling said it was legal for companies to shield themselves from lawsuits by requiring that customers address grievances through a private arbitration system. Since then, consumers seeking redress from banks, even earlier cases against Wells Fargo in California, have been effectively stopped at the courthouse door.
Part of the problem, Werner said, is that banks — and Wells Fargo in particular — use far-reaching language in their arbitration clauses.
In other words, even if an account was opened fraudulently, a legal argument could be made that the arbitration clause on a customer’s existing, legal account would be enough to grant immunity to the bank.
In other words, even if an account was opened fraudulently, a legal argument could be made that the arbitration clause on a customer’s existing, legal account would be enough to grant immunity to the bank.
“There’s no question that it’s very difficult to overturn an arbitration clause, although the facts in this case are pretty damning,” said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director for U. S. PIRG.
The arbitration issue has been on the agency’s radar for some time. Last year, it submitted a report on arbitration to Congress that found such clauses are common in contracts for credit cards and checking accounts, covering roughly half of credit cards and nearly half of bank deposit accounts. The lion’s share of those clauses were put in place by the biggest financial institutions, the CFPB noted.
In May, it submitted a proposed rule that would put the kibosh on mandatory arbitration clauses that prohibit class-action suits in financial-services contracts. The rule got nearly 52,000 responses during its public comment period, with consumer advocates and regular Americans supporting the rule, and business and banking interests weighing in with opposition.
At a Congressional hearing on Tuesday, CFPB director Richard Cordray was asked if the rule would have helped out customers, had it been in place already. “It will be very difficult to get any relief other than through a class action,” he acknowledged. “And yet I believe an arbitration clause here would — might — might defeat a class action.”
Consumer watchdogs say they hope the harsh spotlight being shone on the Wells Fargo case will spur the CFPB to action, or that the bank will voluntarily step out from behind the legal shield afforded by its arbitration policies. (Wells Fargo had no comment.)
Those advocates say it's not enough for Wells Fargo just to refund fees that were assessed on accounts opened without customer approval. Some of those people subsequently may have had to pay higher interest rates on mortgages or credit cards because the unauthorized accounts damaged their credit, a point Senators pressed Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf about in the Tuesday hearing.
Without being able to pursue their case in a courtroom, “There’s a lot of people who won’t be made whole,” Seligman said.
“This has been a longstanding challenge for consumers who want to recoup their losses,” said Suzanne Martindale, a staff attorney at Consumers Union. “This is precisely why consumers deserve their right to a day in court.”",0
"ACCORDING to the ancient Greeks, wine was first discovered by Dionysus, and proved so popular that he was rewarded with godhood. The ancient Persians credit it to a woman who had been banished from the presence of the legendary King Jamshid. Despondent, she wandered into a warehouse where she found a jar containing the remains of some spoiled grapes. Thinking this was as good a method of suicide as any, she drank the liquid. The effect was not quite what she had expected.
For archaeologists, as opposed to mythmakers, untangling the history of wine is particularly hard, partly because the product is perishable and partly because the technique is simple enough to have been invented independently by early settlers in different parts of the world. It did not help that, until recently, archaeologists would wash any ancient pottery they unearthed in hydrochloric acid to strip off any accumulated gunk, which also removed any organic compounds that might have given a clue about what was once stored in the pots.
Fortunately, bits of wine-stained pottery still turn up. As reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, finds at two sites have pushed the origins of large-scale winemaking back to 6,000 BC, half a millennium or more before the previous date. A team of researchers led by Patrick McGovern from the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology analysed wine residue on pieces of clay jars found in the Caucasus mountains in Georgia. Dr McGovern’s work had previously pointed to Iran as the oldest known site.
Dr McGovern and his colleagues discovered traces of four acids—tartaric, malic, succinic and citric—which are found in grape wine. To rule out the possibility of contamination, perhaps from an ancient spillage, they also analysed the soil from which the fragments were excavated. It contained far lower levels of the chemicals. They even cross-checked their findings with climate models, which suggested that climatic conditions at the time the jars were made were ideal for viticulture.
The team’s findings are not quite the earliest evidence of alcoholic drink. Traces of a concoction made from wild grapes, hawthorn fruit, rice beer and honey mead were found in 2003 on pottery from China that dates to around 7,000 BC. But archaeologists think that the drink was probably made in small quantities, since the grapes used were from wild vines, which yield far less fruit than the domesticated sort.
By contrast, the jars found in Georgia suggest winemaking on a serious scale. Each pot held more than 300 litres, enough for 400 modern bottles. Such quantities would have required vineyards and methods of cloning and transplanting similar to those used today. And the Georgian grapes came from Vitis vinifera, the only grapevine species known to have been domesticated. All of the 8,000-10,000 grape varieties grown today originated from it.
The record may not hold for long. Dr McGovern and his colleagues are currently examining pre-Neolithic ruins at the headwaters of the Tigris river in Turkey dating back as far as 9,500 BC. Both China and Georgia may soon have to give way to an even older contender for the invention of vinous bliss.",0
"A Happy Valley, Oregon, couple whose child died in utero are doing their best to help ease the pain of other parents facing the same situation.
Randy and Rebecca Hauskin's daughter Hayden was stillborn in 2010 at 32 weeks gestation. ""I hadn't felt her move and we went right to the hospital,"" Rebecca Hauskin told ABC News. ""We had no knowledge, didn't know what stillborn meant, the thought didn't occur to me,"" she said. The doctor told them there was no heartbeat.
""When you're pregnant and your baby passes, you still have to go through the delivery,"" Randy Hauskin said. Rebecca was in labor for 14 hours. ""You need to make a lifetime of decisions in a really short period of time,"" he said, referring to logistics like funeral arrangements.
Another decision the couple needed to make quickly was whether or not they would want to hold their daughter after her birth. They did.
""At 32 weeks, she was fully formed, just really tiny,"" Randy Hauskin said. Hayden's older sister, Madison, was also given the option of holding her little sister or not. She did.
Rebecca Hauskin said that she ""had never experienced grief like that in her life.""
The couple returned home without their baby, but the nightmare didn't end there. After about six weeks, they began to receive a hospital bill to pay off the $1,000 they owed. The bill was $77 each month, and Randy Hauskin paid it dutifully, though it was a recurring painful reminder of what the family had been through.
It was that experience that eventually led them to develop their foundation, Hayden's Helping Hands. The organization has paid the hospital bills, up to $1,000 each, of 44 stillborn babies in Oregon and Washington.
""The reality is, we can't change stillbirth,"" Rebecca Hauskin said, ""but we can be a resource for these families."" In Hayden's case, she said, the umbilical cord became kinked and stopped delivering nutrients to the baby. There was no way to prevent it.
Her dream, she told ABC News, is to expand the foundation to become national and help families all over the country.
""There's no other organization like it,"" she said, ""and we're not shy about recognizing the babies by name.""
Most families, Rebecca Hauskin said, want to find a way to keep their baby's memory alive. Because of that, Hayden's Helping Hands names each child at their annual fundraiser and on its social media pages.
As for the Hauskins, the foundation is their way of giving Hayden's life meaning. They've had another daughter, Josie, since Hayden's passing but Hayden is still very much part of their lives.
Randy Hauskin said, ""We have three daughters, period.""",0

The Islamic State makes an estimated $50 million a month from selling crude from captured oilfields in Iraq and Syria, according to Iraqi intelligence and U.S. officials.
According to a report by Business Insider:
Oil sales — the extremists’ largest single source of continual income — are a key reason they have been able to maintain their rule over their self-declared “caliphate” stretching across large parts of Syria and Iraq. With the funds to rebuild infrastructure and provide the largesse that shore up its fighters’ loyalty, it has been able to withstand ground fighting against its opponents and more than a year of bombardment in the U.S.-led air campaign.
It’s worth noting that within the past 24 hours the U.S. has launched its first strike against an ISIS oil convoy. Prior to Monday, the United States had refused to strike the over 1,000 ISIS controlled tanker trucks out of a stated concern about causing civilian casualties, a dubious assertion at best.
The NY Times reported:
Intensifying pressure on the Islamic State, United States warplanes for the first time attacked hundreds of trucks on Monday that the extremist group has been using to smuggle the crude oil it has been producing in Syria, American officials said.
According to an initial assessment, 116 trucks were destroyed in the attack, which took place near Deir al-Zour, an area in eastern Syria that is controlled by the Islamic State.
The airstrikes were carried out by four A-10 attack planes and two AC-130 gunships based in Turkey.
While the U.S. claims these new operations were planned well in advance of the terrorist attacks in Paris, one can’t help but be suspicious of the timing of the U.S. change in tactics. It seems that the U.S. is being forced closer to the Russian position in the wake of the attacks in France.
During the press conference, Putin went on to stress that an international coalition is needed to more effectively counter the terrorist group, noting Russia’s readiness to support the fight against ISIS.
“Some armed opposition groups consider it possible to begin active operations against IS with Russia’s support. And we are ready to provide such support from the air. If it happens it could become a good basis for the subsequent work on a political settlement,” Putin said.
“WE REALLY NEED SUPPORT FROM THE US, EUROPEAN NATIONS, SAUDI ARABIA, TURKEY, IRAN,” THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ADDED.
In the wake of the claimed ISIS attacks in Paris, perhaps the NATO contingent involved in Syria will now realize that removing Assad is not the primary goal, and that fighting ISIS is the actual mission.
The Russian intelligence analysis of the 40 nations funding the ISIS terror machine were relayed to diplomats attending the G20 summit – but were not released to the media, nor the general public. We will keep you updated if/when the names of the ISIS supporting states are leaked.",1
"More than 80 homes have been flooded and hundreds of Palestinians forced to evacuate after Israel opened the gates of several dams on the border with the Gaza Strip. Water levels reached more than three meters.
Israeli authorities opened the floodgates to discharge the accumulated water following recent severe winter storms in the region, Palestinian officials said.
In Eastern Gaza residents reported injuries as well as deaths of livestock, caused by the Israeli action which allegedly came without prior notification, Gaza’s Civil Defense Directorate (CDD) said Sunday.
Maan News reports: The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.
Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.
The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel’s assault over summer.
The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.
Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.
Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.
The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams — one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.
Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.
Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.
This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.",1

Obama Moves For National ID Card, Military Prison For All Dissenters
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
New reports coming from America today are warning that as that troubled Nation edges ever closer to what economists are calling the unstoppable second crash, and as their descent into outright socialist rule continues unabated, President Obama is preparing to unleash upon his citizens the most draconian and tyrannical laws ever enacted in their entire history.
Important to note about these new laws Obama is preparing his Nation for is that they are all being quietly put into place while the people in America are being distracted by their propaganda media organs to focus their attention on the so called health care debate and have been deliberately hidden in bills without their knowing.
One of these new hidden laws is being put forward as an immigration measure supposedly to deal with their growing numbers of illegal immigrants, but as we can read as reported by the Wall Street Journal News Service has much more ominous implications for all Americans:
Lawmakers working to craft a new comprehensive immigration bill have settled on a way to prevent employers from hiring illegal immigrants: a national biometric identification card all American workers would eventually be required to obtain.
Under the potentially controversial plan still taking shape in the Senate, all legal U.S. workers, including citizens and immigrants, would be issued an ID card with embedded information, such as fingerprints, to tie the card to the worker.
To those Americans prepared to oppose Obamas plan to remake the United States into a Communist Nation another new law will enable the US Military to arrest and hold them without trial forever, and as we can read as reported by the Atlantic Magazine News Service:
Why is the national security community treating the ""Enemy Belligerent, Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010,"" introduced by Sens. John McCain and Joseph Lieberman on Thursday as a standard proposal, as a simple response to the administration's choices in the aftermath of the Christmas Day bombing attempt? A close reading of the bill suggests it would allow the U.S. military to detain U.S. citizens without trial indefinitely in the U.S. based on suspected activity. Read the bill here, and then read the summarized points after the jump.
According to the summary, the bill sets out a comprehensive policy for the detention, interrogation and trial of suspected enemy belligerents who are believed to have engaged in hostilities against the United States by requiring these individuals to be held in military custody, interrogated for their intelligence value and not provided with a Miranda warning.
(There is no distinction between U.S. persons--visa holders or citizens--and non-U.S. persons.)
In order for Obamas grand plan of communizing the American people to succeed he has deliberately targeted their middle classes for destruction, and no where is this more evident than in millions of them being thrown from their homes, and as we had previously reported on in our February 16th report Obama Plot To Throw Millions Of Americans From Homes Uncovered.
Not satisfied with the pace of this destruction of his middle classes, however, Obama is preparing new laws to force a further 5 million of his citizens from their homes and into the streets, and as we can read as reported by the New York Times News Service:
In an effort to end the foreclosure crisis, the Obama administration has been trying to keep defaulting owners in their homes. Now it will take a new approach: paying some of them to leave.
This latest program, which will allow owners to sell for less than they owe and will give them a little cash to speed them on their way, is one of the administrations most aggressive attempts to grapple with a problem that has defied solutions.
More than five million households are behind on their mortgages and risk foreclosure. The governments $75 billion mortgage modification plan has helped only a small slice of them. Consumer advocates, economists and even some banking industry representatives say much more needs to be done.
In our March 2nd report Russia Warns US Communist Threat Endangering Entire World we had detailed the plans of Obamas Communist forces to destroy the United States and further warned these Americans of Congressman Ron Pauls warning to them that their own government was preparing to openly assassinate all who oppose them, but to no avail as the masses of these people continue to deny the overwhelming evidence showing their destruction is near at hand.
And to the new world these unsuspecting Americans are entering into we can glimpse from the Kitco New Service article titled America's Impending Master Class Dictatorship and which warns:
According to the Federal Reserves most recent report on wealth, Americas private net worth was $53.4 trillion as of September, 2009. But at the same time, Americas debt and unfunded liabilities totaled at least $120,000,000,000,000.00 ($120 trillion), or 225% of the citizens net worth.
Even if the government expropriated every dollar of private wealth in the nation, it would still have a deficit of $66,600,000,000,000.00 ($66.6 trillion), equal to $214,286.00 for every man, woman and child in America and roughly 500% of GDP. If the government does not directly seize the nations private wealth, then it will require $389,610 from each and every citizen to balance the countrys books.
State, county and municipal debts and deficits are additional, already elephantine in many states (e.g., California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York) and growing at an alarming rate nationwide. In addition to the federal government, dozens of states are already bankrupt and sinking deeper into the morass every day.
The government continues to dig a deeper and deeper fiscal grave in which to bury its citizens. This year, the federal deficit will total at least $1,600,000,000,000.00 ($1.6 trillion), which represents overspending of $4,383,561,600.00 ($4.38 billion) per day. (The deficit during October and November, 2009, the first two months of Fiscal Year 2010, totaled $296,700,000,000.00 ($297 billion), or $4,863,934,000.00 ($4.9 billion) per day, a record.)
Using the GAAP accounting method (which is what corporations are required to use because it presents a far more accurate and honest picture of a companys finances than the cash accounting method primarily and misleadingly used by the U.S. government), the nations fiscal year 2009 deficit was roughly $9,000,000,000,000.00 ($9 trillion), or $24,700,000,000.00 ($24.7 billion) per day, as calculated by brilliant and well-respected economist John Williams. (www.shadowstats.com) Fiscal Year 2010s cash- and GAAP-accounting deficits will likely be worse than 2009s, given government bailout and new program spending that is on steroids and psychotic.
Putting Fiscal Year 2009s $9,000,000,000,000.00 ($9 trillion) deficit another way, 17% of Americas private wealth, accumulated over a period of 235 years, was wiped out by just one years worth of government deficit spending insanity.
To if the American people will arise in their righteous wrath to confront the destruction of their Nation it is not in our knowing, other than to note, that in all of history, those who have given up their freedom to despotic rulers have, without exception, condemned themselves, their children, and their grandchildren, to lives of servitude and degradation towards the cruelest of masters who only see them as useless eaters fit for nothing but death.
And do not think for one second that these words are written lightly either, and by clicking on this link you can hear for yourself one of these elites, Bill Microsoft Gates, the Worlds richest man, calling for the outright destruction of over 1 billion human beings to de-populate our Earthof which you, undoubtedly, are a part of.

"A new study published in the Journal of American Medical Association claims that most FDA approved drugs are unfit for human consumption.
It seems that every new medical drug should carry a public health warning: “This FDA approved drug may seriously damage your health.”
Researchersfound that a third of all medicines that were approved by the FDA, were then subsequently quietly labelled with “serious adverse health effects” warnings – some of which warned patients that continuing to consume the drugs could result inlife-threatening complications.
Jon Rappoports Blog reports: For example, cancer and liver damage. For example, death—which, the last time I looked, is life-threatening.
The Washington Post reports: “Among the drugs with added warnings [years after the drugs were approved, as safe, for public use]: Humira, used for arthritis and some other illnesses; Abilify, used for depression and other mental illness; and Pradaxa, a blood thinner. The withdrawn drugs [taken off the market] and the reason: Bextra, an anti-inflammatory medicine, heart problems; Raptiva, a psoriasis drug, rare nervous system illness; and Zelnorm, a bowel illness drug, heart problems.”
A pharma trade-group spokeswoman told the Post: “Even with rigorous clinical studies and regulatory review it may be impossible to detect certain safety signals until several years after approval, once the medicine is in broader use.”
No doubt. And that’s why the public is subjected to the luck of the draw, a roll of the dice, a spin of the roulette wheel.
Of course, as I never tire of pointing out, a landmark review (July 26, 2000) in the Journal of American Medical Association, by Dr. Barbara Starfield, found that, every year in the US, FDA approved drugs kill 106,000 people. Extrapolating to a decade, that would be a million deaths.
The new study confirms only a small part of the overall problem.
And the overall problem is what major media don’t want to report on—and what the federal government doesn’t want to touch with a 10-foot pole.
The new study is what intelligence agencies would call a limited hangout, which is a public admission of part of a problem or scandal that is, in fact, much bigger. The huge scandal, in this case, is the routine death-by-medicine numbers every year—which is ignored by the press and the government.
106,000 Americans killed by FDA approved medicines every year. That’s the big one. That remains hidden and unacknowledged.
NOTE: under Trump, the FDA is urged to speed up the drug-approval process. It’s good for business. For patients, it’s a disaster on top of the already existing disaster.",1
"DETROIT — BMW is recalling more than 1 million cars and SUVs in two U. S. recalls due to the risk of fires under the hood, and it's recommending that they be parked outdoors until repairs are made.
A spokesman for the German automaker says the risk of fire is very low in both cases, but the vehicles should stay outside ""in an abundance of caution."" In both recalls, repairs are expected to start on Dec. 18.
The largest of the recalls covers over 740,000 328i, 328xi, 328i xDrive, 525i, 525xi, 528i, 528xi, 530i, 530xi, X3 3.0si, X3 xDrive30i, X5 xDrive30i, Z4 3.0i, Z4 3.0si and Z4 sDrive30i vehicles from 2007-2011. Also included is the 2008-2011 128i. All have 6-Cylinder engines.
Documents posted Friday by the U. S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show that a heater for the positive crankcase ventilation valve can overheat and cause the valve to melt, increasing the risk of a fire even when the vehicle is not in use. No injuries have been reported. Dealers will replace the heater.
The heater is designed to prevent the valve from freezing in cold temperatures, BMW spokesman Hector Arellano-Belloc said. But irregularities in manufacturing can cause corrosion can lead to overheating.
The other recall covers nearly 673,000 cars including the 323i, 325i, 325xi, 328i, 328xi, 330i, 330xi, 335i, 335xi and M3 from the 2006-2011 model years. Also covered are the 2007-2011 328i xDrive, 335i xDrive and 335is, and the 2009-2011 335d.
Wiring for the heating and air conditioning system can overheat and cause connectors to melt, also increasing the fire risk, even when vehicles are unattended. Four drivers reported injuries. BMW says a wiring connection can corrode and in rare cases cause fires.
Dealers will replace the wiring and connectors.
The U. S. recalls total about 1.4 million vehicles, but some are included in both, BMW said.
About 80,000 vehicles also are being recalled in Canada for the crankcase ventilation valve heater, BMW said. The company is reviewing whether the wiring recall will apply to Canadian vehicles.",0
"Human faeces left by climbers on Mount Everest is becoming a serious health problem threatening to spread disease, the chief of Nepal’s mountaineering association said on Tuesday.
Human faeces left by climbers on Mount Everest is becoming a serious health problem threatening to spread disease, the chief of Nepal’s mountaineering association said on Tuesday.
The more than 700 climbers and guides who spend nearly two months on Everest’s slopes each climbing season leave large amounts of feces and urine, and the issue has not been addressed, Ang Tshering told reporters. He said Nepal’s government needs to get the climbers to dispose of the waste properly so the mountain remains pristine.
Hundreds of foreign climbers attempt to scale Everest during Nepal’s mountaineering season, which began this week and runs through May. Last year’s season was canceled after 16 local guides were killed in an avalanche in April.
Climbers spend weeks acclimatizing around the four camps set up between the base camp at 5,300 meters (17,380 feet) and the 8,850-meter-high (29,035-foot-high) summit. The camps have tents and some essential equipment and supplies, but do not have toilets.
“Climbers usually dig holes in the snow for their toilet use and leave the human waste there,” Tshering said, adding that the waste has been “piling up” for years around the four camps.
At the base camp, where there are more porters, cooks and support staff during the climbing season, there are toilet tents with drums to store the waste. Once filled, the drums are carried to a lower area, where the waste is properly disposed.
Dawa Steven Sherpa, who has been leading Everest cleanup expeditions since 2008, said some climbers carry disposable travel toilet bags to use in the higher camps.
“It is a health hazard and the issue needs to be addressed,” he said.
Nepal’s government has not come up with a plan yet to tackle the issue of human waste. But starting this season, officials stationed at the base camp will strictly monitor garbage on the mountain, said Puspa Raj Katuwal, the head of the government’s Mountaineering Department.
The government imposed new rules last year requiring each climber to bring down to the base camp 8 kilograms (18 pounds) of trash — the amount it estimates a climber discards along the route.
Climbing teams must leave a $4,000 deposit that they lose if they don’t comply with the regulations, Katuwal said.
More than 4,000 climbers have scaled Mount Everest since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealand climber Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay. Hundreds of others have died in the attempt, while many have succeeded only with help from oxygen tanks, equipment porters and Sherpa guides.",1

Buy Photo              River Terrace in Northeast Washington is a modest, under-the-radar neighborhood of neat rowhouses, duplexes and a few rental apartment buildings.  It’s quiet because the streets are exclusively residential, with no through traffic and limited entry points, and it is one of the few places in the city where you can find a home for less than $300,000.  “It’s really an oversized cul-de-sac,” said Patrick Hughes, a resident since 2002 with his partner, Chris Quinones.  The lush grounds of Anacostia Park and River Terrace Park and well-designed trails along the Anacostia River are neighborhood perks that provide residents with exceptional quality-of-life benefits — green space, fresh air, shade under the trees, a playground and water vistas.  “We walk the dog along the trails. I ran there this morning, and I often bike there. We have season tickets to the Nationals and pick up a bike share and ride to Eastern Market and Navy Yard,” said Jessica Jones Capparell, who moved there with Richard Capparell a year ago. They were recently married in their back yard. “I love our proximity to the park and trails, which I take to the H Street corridor and Stadium Armory. I feel totally connected to D. C. and not trapped as far as walking and biking,” said Quinones. He bikes everywhere.  [In Arlington, Lyon Village lives up to the second part of its name]  There’s a mix of ages in the neighborhood, but the age profile skews older. “Many people are here for decades and some were born in their houses,” said Jones Capparell.

Many houses have front porches, are up a few steps from the sidewalk and have colorful flowers decorating small yards. Capparell and Quinones were watering the lawn on a recent hot Sunday. “There are quite a few fancy gardens here,” said Quinones, after a guest admired his. “People take pride. They have a sense of ownership, and they’re nice, too.” “We cut everyone’s grass in the four houses down from us,” said Hughes. “The yards are so small — how could I not when I have the lawn mower out? My neighbor shovels our snow in the winter. Another neighbor gave me tickets for the National Museum of African History and Culture, which are impossible to get.”  Justin Tanner, an agent with the Real Estate in D.C. team, has been selling in the neighborhood for years. “The first home to break $300,000 was in fall 2015,” he said. “In the past 20 months, 10 homes have crossed that barrier. I predict within the next year the $400,000 mark will be broken.” “River Terrace is definitely worth keeping an eye on,” he said. “One house under contract now was listed for $285,000 last month.

"Licensed gun owners with extra training could legally carry inside schools, churches, bars and other pistol-free zones under hotly contested legislation that was approved Wednesday by the Republican-led Michigan Senate, days after the Texas church massacre.
The bills were sent to the GOP-led House for consideration next. They face an uncertain future because Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, vetoed a similar plan in 2012 following the mass shooting of elementary schoolchildren in Connecticut.
Snyder is not commenting on the new legislation until or if it wins final legislative passage.
In Michigan, it is illegal for the nearly 618,000 people with concealed weapons permits to carry in designated gun-free zones: schools, day cares, stadiums, large concert halls, taverns, places of worship, hospitals, many college dorms or classrooms, and casinos.
The legislation would legalize the right to carry in those places if a license holder gets eight more hours of training, though privately owned businesses such as bars could stay pistol-free. People licensed to carry would be banned from openly carrying or intentionally displaying a pistol — a provision that addresses a ""loophole"" that has allowed armed open-carry activists to enter the gun-free zones and has sparked lawsuits.
The current law already gives the leaders of churches, synagogues, mosques and other places of worship permission to allow concealed weapons.
Twenty-five Republicans voted for the main bill . All 11 Democrats and one Republican opposed it.
The sponsor, GOP Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof of West Olive, said the recent mass shootings in Texas and Las Vegas highlight the need to act.
""I believe citizens have the right to be free and safe and secure and to defend themselves and their loved ones,"" he said. ""Responsible, well-trained, licensed gun owners may be one of those deterrents to those individuals who seek out gun-free zones as opportunities to commit heinous crimes.""
Opponents, including gun-control advocates and the education lobby, criticized allowing anyone other than a law enforcement or security officer to bring pistols inside schools, day care centers and other public spaces. They called it the ""pistols in preschools"" legislation, warned of accidental shootings and chaos for police responding to active shooters, and said it could boost liability insurance costs. Critics also questioned allowing alcohol and guns to mix and said the bills would do nothing to stop bad actors from obtaining guns in the first place.
""Real life is not an action movie. The reality is you're much more likely to have an accident in a preschool, in a day care center, in a school"" if the legislation becomes law, Senate Democratic Leader Jim Ananich, a former teacher from Flint, said during the debate.
More than three-dozen volunteer members of the group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America watched the afternoon debate from the Senate gallery. The National Rifle Association supports the bills.
A Republican spokeswoman said school districts would be authorized to prevent their teachers and other employees from bringing a gun into a school building under an existing law, though a Democratic spokeswoman said the matter should be clarified. The legislation also would make property owned by public airport authorities pistol-free zones unless a gun owner has the additional training.
Another bill that passed along party lines Wednesday would let 18- to 20-year-olds obtain a provisional concealed pistol permit. The current minimum age is 21.
The state Senate also voted to include school districts, libraries and community colleges in a state ban on local gun regulations and to loosen gun restrictions for foster parents.
It was the latest salvo from a GOP-led Legislature that at times has been at odds with the governor on guns. In June, the state House approved legislation that would make it voluntary to have a concealed pistol license.
When Snyder vetoed the proposed elimination of gun-free zones in 2012, he primarily expressed concern that the bill would not have let public entities such as schools, day care facilities and hospitals choose to remain gun-free.

"New cases of hepatitis C have nearly tripled in the past five years, driven mostly by people sharing needles to inject drugs, federal health officials said Thursday.
Since the liver-destroying infection doesn’t usually cause symptoms until it’s too late, it is important to make sure people get tested — and to fight the practices that get people infected in the first place, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a new report.
That includes needle exchange programs frowned on by many conservative lawmakers.
“Reported cases of acute HCV infection increased more than 2.9-fold from 2010 through 2015, rising annually throughout this period,” the report reads.
The rate of new infections is rising fastest among younger adults, the CDC said.
“Several early investigations of newly acquired hepatitis C infections reveal that most occur among young, white persons who live in non-urban areas (particularly in states within the Appalachian, Midwestern, and New England regions of the country),” the report reads.
“This is primarily a result of increasing injection drug use associated with America’s growing opioid epidemic,” the CDC added.
Rates have nearly doubled among pregnant women, the CDC said. Pregnant women can pass the virus to their babies.
Hepatitis C is one of the leading infectious disease killers. Nearly 20,000 Americans died from hepatitis C in 2015, the CDC said. About 3.5 million people, mostly over 55, are infected.
Drugs can cure hepatitis C, but they are expensive. Gilead's Sovaldi costs about $84,000 for a weeks-long regimen. The second-generation version, called Harvoni, costs more than $94,000 for similar treatment.
“While new medicines can now cure hepatitis C virus infections in as little as two to three months, many people in need of treatment are still not able to get it,” the CDC added.
“By testing, curing, and preventing hepatitis C, we can protect generations of Americans from needless suffering and death,” said the CDC’s Dr. Jonathan Mermin.
And the CDC advocates using needle exchange programs to prevent infection. Sharing needles can infect people not only with hepatitis, but with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS.
“Comprehensive syringe service programs are one of many tools that communities can use to prevent hepatitis and other injection-related infectious diseases,” the CDC said.
""These programs also help link people to treatments to stop drug use, testing for infectious diseases that can be spread to others, and medical care.""
One recent CDC study found that only three states — Massachusetts, New Mexico, and Washington — have laws to help people get into comprehensive needle exchange programs and provide hepatitis treatments and preventive services for people who inject drugs.
The CDC found 18 states still made needle exchanges illegal and had laws making it a crime to have or distribute syringes.",0
"When U. K. Brexit Secretary David Davis told his cabinet colleagues last week that they should brace for ""the unlikely scenario in which no mutually satisfactory agreement"" is reached on Brexit, it set off alarm bells in one industry in particular -- and it's not the finance industry.
Britain's automotive industry employs 169,000 workers directly in manufacturing and a total of more than 800,000 workers across the sector, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), an industry lobbying group. The prospect of tariffs both on the 1.3 million cars the U. K. exports each year and on the parts that cross back and forth between the U.K. and the EU is putting those jobs at risk.
Nissan Motor Co. estimates it could lose as much as 600 million pounds ($738 million) in profit on the 320,000 Qashqai SUVs it makes annually in Sunderland, Senior Vice President Colin Lawther told lawmakers on Wednesday. That's based on an estimated 10 percent tariff on exports to the EU, plus duties of as much as 4.5 percent on imported parts.
Swati Dhingra, an economics lecturer at the London School of Economics, estimated in a study prior to last year's referendum that Brexit could reduce total U. K. car production by as much as 12 percent.
Exports from the U. K. auto industry are worth more than 34 billion pounds, accounting for 12 percent of the country's total exports of goods based on the most recent figures for 2015, according to the SMMT. While those goods are sold to more than 100 countries, the EU is by far the most important market, with a share of 57.5 percent dwarfing about 11 percent to the U.S. and 7 percent to China:
Carmakers are trying to insulate themselves from the effects of leaving the EU. McLaren Automotive Ltd., for example, is building a Sheffield factory to move chassis production out of Austria. The move, already planned prior to the June referendum, reduces the risk that the maker of models including the $1.4 million P1 supercar will face tariffs on parts imported from Europe, which currently comprise about half of the cost of a car. Jaguar Land Rover, part of India's Tata Motors Ltd., is also sourcing more parts from the U. K.
Nissan, which employs more than 7,000 workers directly at its Sunderland factory with a further 28,000 jobs at suppliers dependent on the Japanese company, is so far the only automaker to have secured a post-Brexit commitment from the government. The support came in the form of a secret October letter from Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark, who later revealed that he'd made four key pledges, including seeking to maintain tariff-free access to the EU for the car industry. No wonder Nissan has reserved the right to revisit its investment decisions once the U. K. concludes its exit negotiations.
Avoiding tariffs seems incompatible with the government's willingness to abandon the EU's customs union. Confederation of British Industry president Paul Drechslerwill warned in a speech on Thursday that leaving the EU without a trade deal would inflict World Trade Organization tariffs on 90 percent of the goods British companies export, opening a ""Pandora’s Box of economic consequences.""
In response to Nissan's comments last week, Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman Greg Swift said the government will seek ""a deal that allows there to be an environment for Nissan and other companies in the automotive sector to flourish."" May is on the record as saying that ""no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal."" The auto industry suggests any deal that minimizes the future cost of doing business with the EU is better than no deal at all.

"In the world of conservative thought, few issues are as popular as tax reform. It's an accepted truth, by nearly anyone on the right, that the tax code is too complicated for an average citizen to understand and too laden with loopholes to be fair.
Beyond the structure of the code itself it's a fairly standard conservative view that taxes themselves are unjust, that government should not be confiscating a large chunk of our hard-earned pay and they certainly shouldn't then be helping themselves to additional taxes after that first take.
In a perfect conservative world there would either be no taxes at all or a tax which would be simple to understand, a flat tax or the Fair Tax. But we don't live in that perfect conservative world and so we recognize that tax policy, while still being burdensome, complicated and unfair, is used to achieve various societal objectives.
The marriage tax benefit, for example, is there to encourage people to get married. The electric vehicle credit exists to encourage people to reduce their oil consumption. The American Opportunity Tax Credit encourages people to go to post-secondary school such as colleges or trade schools. And so on.
What then can be seen as the point of the tax plan, called ""The Tax Cuts And Jobs Act” announced by the Republicans in the House of Representatives last Thursday? There are no obvious goals whatsoever in the convoluted plan.
This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills.
The plan does absolutely nothing to simplify the process. No matter how many times Republican leadership promises that we’ll be able to do our taxes on a postcard, that’s not what the reality will be for nearly anyone. Credits and deductions will still exist though some have been targeted by this plan seemingly at random.
One such nonsensical target is the adoption tax credit. Where is the ideological sense in getting rid of a credit to ease the financial burden of adoption? Conservatives always suggest adoption as an alternative to abortion. But adoption is incredibly costly and the credit has been a boon to families looking to adopt, so why cut it?
“Who loses?” asked Laura Saunders in the Wall Street Journal. “Highly paid employees in high-tax states; future buyers of large homes or second homes; high-earning home sellers; people who take medical deductions; and future alimony payers, among others.”
Why get rid of the write-off for medical expenses? It’s practically an admission that single-payer is coming and Republicans don't plan to stop it. Why else not work to defray the costs of people paying for medical care out of pocket? How is that conservative?
Professionals will be hardest hit by the plan. People making $200,000-500,000 will see their taxes go up by 2023 according to a report released by Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. Since when do Republicans want to disincentivize success? This isn’t targeting the super-rich, this is targeting the newly rich, families just achieving their American dream.
The mortgage interest rate deduction will drop from $1,000,000 to $500,000--an amount seemingly aimed specifically at people in blue states and the upper middle class.
The plan also doesn’t do anything for small businesses. It contains a provision to limit the tax burden to 25 percent for a small business. But as Josh Barro at Business Insider points out “More than 80 percent of tax filers with small-business income are already taxed at rates of 25 percent or less, so only the wealthiest business owners, who currently face high tax brackets, would get a tax cut.” The National Federation of Independent Business, generally a conservative group, said in a statement that they could not support the bill in its current form.
This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills. The free-market organization Club for Growth put out a statement noting that the bill “effectively punishes success and caves to the Democrats’ class warfare rhetoric.”
That leads to the question of why it’s such an over-compromised bill in the first place.
Conservatives claim to want a real simplification of the tax code. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has spent years promising this. If now, with a Republican House, Senate and presidency, isn’t the time to make bold moves on tax policy then when would be the time? This whole plan is an admission that Republican leadership are too afraid to ever be bold and that there will never be a true conservative movement to simplify or reduce taxes, no matter how many Republicans are elected to office.
What do conservatives believe or represent in 2017? If conservatives in Congress can't be counted on to even attempt to alter the tax code, and they can't be counted on to promote conservative values through the tax policies they design, what's the point of conservatism at all?",0
"It’s safe to say McDonald’s isn’t exactlylovin’how they recently became the butt of a practical joke.
AFake McDonald’s Twitter account has been suspended by the social media service for masquerading as an official Twitter account of McDonald’s Hong Kong — but not before it was able to pull off a prank more than nine months in the making.
The people behind the @McDonalds_HK Twitter account — which briefly changed its name to @NotMcDonaldsHK before being suspended — had been posting inoffensive, seemingly genuine McDonald’s-like tweets since October 2016, touting new menu items and promotions that McDonald’s Hong Kong was legitimately offering at its locations.
Just last week, however, @McDonalds_HK began posting a series of strange messages that hinted at the prank. Over the course of a few days, the “McDonald’s” employee behind the account appeared to be growing more and more unhinged, tweeting about how his wife and child abandoned him, and how he now wished to die.
A spokesperson for McDonald’s has since released a statement on the matter, telling Gizmodo that McDonald’s was in no way affiliated with this Twitter account.
“This is not a McDonald’s Twitter account but one that is impersonating a verified account,” said Terri Hickey, the manager of global corporate communications for McDonald’s. “We are taking steps to have it promptly taken down.”
It’s unclear exactly when the pranksters originally intended to reveal their true nature, but they seemed to be prompted to reveal the joke after they were tagged in a tweet from the official, verified account of McDonald’s. The post has since been deleted, but Gizmodo reports that it contained a video of a McDonald’s Hong Kong employee advertising the restaurant’s new cheesecake.
The fake account responded on July 24, writing, “this b---- freakin out about cheesecake while kids out here McDying. Relax,” and then promptly resumed tweeting about McDonald’s promotions in Hong Kong.
The next indication that @McDonalds_HK was a sham came on July 27, when the account shared a message reading, “please kill me I wish to die.” Days later, the “McDonald’s” account posted several more cryptic, depressing messages, including: “where is my son they took my son,” and, ""I miss her so f---ing much. f--- this job. where is my wife and where is my son.""
Followers soon picked up on the joke, though some of them expressed concern for the person posting the messages.
The Daily Meal reports that the account amassed nearly 24,000 followers this weekend alone, after its tweets began going viral. But once the jig was up, the account was forced to adopt a new name (@NotMcDonaldsHK) and re-brand itself as a parody account. However, this account, too, has been suspended by Twitter.

"Insys Therapeutics is a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes innovative drugs and novel drug delivery systems of therapeutic molecules that improve the quality of life of patients. Insys is committed to patient safety and ensuring the proper prescribing and use of its products.
As a preliminary matter, we would like to put context around the use of Subsys based upon available data and information. Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (“TIRFs”, i.e., the class of fentanyl products which Subsys is included in) comprise a very small percentage of all opioid prescriptions in a given year. More specifically, there were approximately 190 million and 175 million opioid analgesic prescriptions written in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In comparison, there were less than 120,000 in 2015 and less than 80,000 prescriptions in 2016 for TIRF REMS products. This class of TIRF products has been trending downward since its peak of approximately 356,000 in 2007. In addition, TIRF products are regulated by a FDA mandated REMS program that is designed to mitigate the risks of misuse, abuse, addiction and overdose of these products. In order for a physician to prescribe, a pharmacy to dispense and a patient to receive a TIRF product, each of the physician, pharmacy and patient must be enrolled in this TIRF REMS program and be educated on, among other matters, the indicated use for such class of products. It is worth noting that not all opioid products are regulated by a mandatory and stringent REMS program.
Subsys was the sixth entrant into the TIRF market and was commercially launched in March 2012. On a percentage basis, TIRFs were less than a tenth of a percentage point of the total opioid market in 2015 and 2016. There were approximately 54,000 total prescriptions in 2015 and approximately 34,000 total prescriptions in 2016 of Subsys, which comprised less than 0.04% percentage of all opioids in each of these respective years. Accordingly, Insys does not believe it (or its fentanyl product Subsys) has contributed to the national, opioid epidemic in any material way.
Insys strives to play a meaningful role in providing solutions to address the opioid epidemic by leveraging its expertise in drug development and in developing innovative products. These potential product solutions include, buprenorphine sublingual spray (a potentially safer opioid), buprenorphine/naloxone spray (for the treatment of opioid dependence), fentanyl/naloxone sublingual spray (an abuse deterrent TIRF), cannabidiol (a novel non-opioid) for the treatment of opioid dependence, cannabidiol for the treatment of pain and naloxone nasal spray (for the treatment of opioid overdose). Insys has committed significant resources to these efforts including seeking guidance and input from nearly 30 researchers across the country and has ongoing collaborations with leading academic institutions.
Insys also requires its personnel to undergo specific training on company policies and procedure which are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Insys has a comprehensive compliance program in place with protocols and monitoring that are designed to ensure its sales and marketing practices comply with applicable laws.
The charges against individuals, including our former employees, discussed in your news story relate to previously disclosed investigations and litigation. Insys continues to cooperate with all relevant authorities in its ongoing investigations, including our federal investigation which began in and around December 2013. We are committed to complying with laws and regulations that govern the promotion of our products and all other business practices. We continue to emphasize ethical behavior within our organization and pursue opportunities to illustrate that our company’s mission is to put patients first.",0
"The U. S. Navy hospital ship that Hillary Clinton wants the Trump administration to send to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico has one of the largest trauma facilities in the United States.
Hurricane Maria struck as a Category 4 storm, knocking out the power grid. Hospitals are flooded and back-up generators at many facilities have failed.
The 1,000-bed USNS Comfort is equipped to handle large-scale disasters. In 2010, the ship was sent to Haiti after a large earthquake killed more than 200,000 people. In 2005, the ship docked in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
In 2003, the 894-foot-long hospital ship spent 56 days in the Persian Gulf during the invasion of Iraq. The ship's doctors treated 700 people. Patients included wounded U. S. military members and Iraqi civilians,according to the U.S. Navy website.
The Comfort has a supply of 5,000 units of blood and is equipped with X-ray machines, CAT scan units, a dental office, an optometry facility, a physical therapy center and a pharmacy.
On Sunday, Clinton said in a tweet that President Trump and Defense Secretary James Mattis should send the Navy and the Comfort to avert a humanitarian catastrophe.
""These are American citizens,"" she said.
The storm killed 10 people on Puerto Rico, including two police officers who drowned in floodwaters in the western town of Aguada.
The death toll is expected to rise as reports from remote towns continue to trickle in to officials in San Juan.
Authorities in the town of Vega Alta on the north coast said they had been unable to reach an entire neighborhood, and were particularly worried about residents of a nursing home.
The north coastal town of Manatíhas run out of fuel and fresh water, Mayor Jose Sanchez Gonzalez said.
""Hysteria is starting to spread. The hospital is about to collapse. It's at capacity,"" he said, crying. ""We need someone to help us immediately.""
Across Puerto Rico, more than 15,000 people were in shelters, including some 2,000 rescued from the north coastal town of Toa Baja.
The Comfort spent two months in Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake, treating more than 800 people.
The Navy said that at times during the Comfort’s presence off the coast of Port-au-Prince, some 1,300 medical staff from the U. S. military and nongovernmental organizations were on hand to treat the injured. The Comfort’s 10 operating rooms were staffed around the clock.
""We are immensely proud of the contributions made by everyone who helped treat critically injured survivors aboard Comfort,"" said U. S. Air Force Gen. Douglas Fraser, commander of U.S. Southern Command. ""Their efforts saved the lives of many patients and helped everyone treated begin the important process of recovery. Their rapid response and contribution to the international relief efforts in Haiti helped the country overcome an urgent medical crisis at a time when access to surgical care on the ground was very limited.""
In 2007, the hospital ship was enlisted for a four-month humanitarian mission in Latin America and the Caribbean.
It made stops in a dozen different countries, treating almost 100,000 people. It was billed as a goodwill mission,according to Reuters.
“This is part of the evolving mission of the Southern Command,” former U. S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said at the time. “These are the kinds of missions that we have in mind in connection with our new command, the Africa Command, to focus on building partnerships and increasing the capabilities of individual countries in being able to deal with these challenges.”

"Army Lt. Col. Khallid Shabazz, a Muslim chaplain, has accepted the job of handling the spiritual affairs of 14,000 mostly Christian soldiers.
“I’m on the phone saying, ‘Thank you, I appreciate it. I’ll serve honorably,’ and then I hang up the phone and I’m jumping all around like a little kid,” Shabazz said. “I was running around the office saying, al hamdulillah, al hamdulillah, praise be to God!”
What is the Army trying to say with this high-profile appointment? They’re obviously pushing the, “Islam is a religion of peace,” mantra. They are essentially acting like some leftist PC college student who wants to signal his virtue to the other crazy leftists. Only this is literally a matter of life and death for our troops, to say nothing of the effects on their Christian lives
Let’s see what some Muslims have been doing in the Armed Services:
Army soldier Ali Mohamed, who pleaded guilty to conspiring with Osama bin Laden to “attack any Western target in the Middle East” and admitted his role in the 1998 African embassy bombings.  Army reservist Jeffrey Leon Battle, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to levy war against the United States. Navy sailor Hassan Abu-Jihaad, convicted on charges ofespionage and material support forterrorismafter serving aboard the USS Benfold and sharing classified information with al-Qaeda financiers, including U. S. ship movements prior to the USS Cole bombing in Yemen. U.S. Army private first class Naser Jason Abdo, who plotted to kill his fellow soldiers to “get even” with the military and strike at kafirs (non-Muslims).
The military’s Muslim-chaplains are also said to be similarly infiltrated by radical imams tied to the Muslim Brotherhood, a group that supports worldwide Sharia.
It is not “Islamophobia” to point out the facts. Muslim soldiers being asked to fight other Muslims in the middle-east is an obvious test of their religious convictions. The above examples show some of the serious results. How can we be sure this man who has been put in charge of the spiritual lives of 14,000 of our young soldiers will not try to convert them or make them less likely to follow orders?
The bottom line is this. Most of our soldiers are Christians. Give them Christian chaplains!",1
"“More than 100,000 soldiers and officers will participate in the surprise check of combat readiness of the forces assigned to Russia’s Eastern Military District, the country’s Defense Ministry said.
The ad hoc maneuvers will involve the 3rd Command of the Air Force and Air Defense Troops, the command of the Pacific Fleet, as well as the command of Strategic and Military Transport Aviation, the ministry said.
The inspection, which kicked off at 10:00 local time (06:00 GMT) on September 11, was ordered by the Supreme Commander of the Russian Armed Forces, President Vladimir Putin.
The surprise drill “envisions participation of the combat planning and control agencies at the level of the military district, separate armies and brigades, mechanized infantry and reconnaissance units, signal corps and logistics units, ships, submarines and auxiliary seacraft, as well as the units of Strategic, Military Transport and Frontline Aviation,” Gen. Nikolay Bogdanovsky, the chief of the inspection group, was cited by Itar-Tass news agency as saying.
According to Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, special attention during the exercises will be paid to “checking the redeployment of the troops on long distances as it’s a priority task for the Armed Forces.”
The Defense Ministry also noted that ad hoc inspections have become a regular practice for the Russian military since early 2013.
In June, similar unscheduled war games involved 65,000 troops in the Central Military District, which united all Russian forces in Siberia, the Urals and beyond.
It was the second check for the Central Military District, as it was already tested in February, along with the Western Military District.”",1
"There are new questions about the small plane Roy Halladay was flying when he crashed into the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday near Tampa, Florida.
The new video shows what appears to be Halladay's final moments -- flying close to the water before crashing the ICON A5 he'd owned for less than a month.
The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the crash.
""A lot of witnesses have said plane was maneuvering at low altitude,"" said the NTSB's Noreen Price.
ICON has marketed the A5, which can land on water, as safe and easy to fly even for inexperienced pilots. The small two-seater has a cockpit designed to resemble a car and comes equipped with a parachute.
Halladay's deadly accident is at least the third crash this year. ICON began delivering the A5 in 2015. The price starts at $270,000.
In April, an A5 crashed near Key Largo, and a month later, the company's chief test pilot and director of engineering died in a crash. The NTSB blamed both incidents on pilot error.
""This is extraordinary to have three accidents in 6-7 months,"" said former former NTSB chair Mark Rosenker. ""It certainly is raising questions about its stability, its ease of flight or also the possibility that too many pilots are taking the simplicity for granted, and thereby making mistakes.""
In a promotional video, ICON used Halladay saying ""this is pretty cool, to think I'd get to take that home is pretty surreal.""
The company says it was ""devastated"" to hear of Halladay's death and will ""do everything it can to support the accident investigation going forward.""
The FAA declined to comment on questions about the plane's safety record. Last month, ICON's CEO issued new guidance to pilots about low-altitude flying, encouraging flying at least 300 feet, but the FAA generally recommends flying at least 500 feet or higher.",0
"American patriots in Riverside, California, were recently outraged when a manager at a Buffalo Wild Wings location muted the National Anthem before a recent NFL game. Instantly, one fed-up customer took action against the liberal manager and made him regret his despicable behavior.
According to local news source CBS2, the incident took place at a Buffalo Wild Wings on Monday, September 11, 2017, the anniversary of the radical Islamic terrorist attacks that occurred 2001. The America-hating manager reportedly muted the National Anthem before the Broncos Vs. Chargers game. Instantly, angry customers asked the manager why on earth he would mute the National Anthem, and the reason he gave them was truly sickening, proving this guy does not belong in the customer service industry.
The manager was the jerk who muted the National Anthem and angered many customers. He told customers that the National Anthem is “too controversial” and said that it was a corporate policy to mute it at Buffalo Wild Wings locations.The customer who took action is named Lori Feliz. She instantly took the manager’s picture and posted it to Facebook with a very appropriate question for the wild wings food chain restaurant.
Instantly, angry viewers on Facebook began to comment on his anti-American behavior. One person named Ed Alaniz said, “Okay…so don’t eat or drink there! No National Anthem…No Business!!!!” while another viewer named Michelle Edwards said, “Thanks for sharing…. they just lost my business permanently. Even if it wasn’t mandated by corporate, obviously this franchise allowed it.”Linda Aguilar Hefneradded,“I hope the next report about this business is that the employee was fired. Talk about alienating your customers!”
I agree with the pissed off customers. When calls were made to Buffalo Wild Wings corporate office, a spokesman named Wray Hutchinson responded with a statement, saying,“World Wide Wings, a Buffalo Wild Wings franchise, apologizes for what happened at our restaurant before the Monday Night Football game. We do not have a policy regarding this matter.”
So, the manager appears to have lied to the angry customers who were in his restaurant that night. There is no corporate policy saying that the National Anthem is “too controversial.” It was his own personal hatred for our country that made him turn it off before the game.This degenerate has freedom and the ability to get a job because of men and women who have died for our country. The least he can do is play the National Anthem in his restaurant.
This guy needs to have a serious reality check before he ends up out of a job. Many customers in Riverside, California, are outraged at his behavior and have said they will not return to that location as a result of the situation. I can’t blame them. I would do exactly the same thing. While the owners and management of that particular franchise may not love or respect our country, they sure do love the money that allows them to stay in business. Hit them where it hurts —the pocketbook.",1

Bush Preparing For Armageddon, Warns Russias Top General
By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers (Traducción al Espaol abajo)
In a strongly worded report delivered to the Kremlin today, Russia's Chief of Staff, General Yuri Baluyevski, has issued a warning to President Medvedev that the United States President is fully preparing for Armageddon.
General Baluyevski, these reports state, issued his warning after returning from the Georgian breakaway region of Abkhazia, and where he had further stated:
""The only decision today which may stop ... a military conflict in Georgia is to stop the militarization of Georgia. Unfortunately, in the past several months and years this has been growing...""
In an eerie coincidence of timing on General Baluyevskis warning, the United States President was this week, indeed, overlooking the Mount of Megiddo Armageddon battlefield with Israels Prime Minister Ehud Olmert [both pictured top left], and where historians believe more battles have been fought than any other place on Earth, and which many believe the final battle of World will be fought in the very near future.
The United States President further flamed the fans of Total War by his shocking remarks made to the Israeli Knesset, and as we can read as reported by the Christian Science Monitor News Service:
""This struggle is waged with the technology of the 21st century, but at its core it is the ancient battle between good and evil, the killers claim the mantle of Islam, but they are not religious men.""
His prepared speech was also laden with religious imagery, mapping a spiritual and ideological picture of a close US-Israel relationship that seemed unprecedented in a speech by any US president, analysts say.""
Russian Economists, however, continue to report that the United States and its Western Allies have virtually no choice but to engage the World in Total War as their economies near collapse, a point made even starker with the US Federal Reserve reporting today that its loans to American banks to keep them from crashing has now reached record levels.
Further destabilizing the Western powers is the growing Global fuel crisis, and which Mexico, one of their top oil exporters, has now issued a warning that they are facing a ""severe energy crisis"".
The Wests financial crisis, combined with the Global fuel crisis, joins our Worlds food crisis, and which we had previously reported on in our May 7th report, ""Massive Starvation For World Feared Over Myanmar And Chile Catastrophes"", is fast leading to a catastrophic displacement of over a hundred million human beings searching the Globe for food and water.
And today, as over 200,000 are reported dead in one of Asias largest rice producing regions, and over 50,000 are being reported dead in the heart of Chinas most productive agriculture region where over 4.3 million homes have also been destroyed, Britains Prince Charles has issued the most direst of warnings stating that our World has only 18 months left to avert a climate change disaster.
Not to be forgotten of our Worlds present woes is the deadly virus killing the children in China (where 42 have died and over 25,000 remain ill) and the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus which has claimed another two childrens lives in Indonesia, and just to mention two of the growing numbers of diseases and viruses rampaging across the World.
Human beings are, also, not alone in being devastated on the Earth as the World Wildlife Fund is now reporting that wildlife is disappearing from our Planet at a catastrophic rate, with fully a third of all our animal species now gone forever.
But, to the greatest understanding of all of these things, and a vile portent for the future of our human race, one only has to climb upon a hillside in the United States region of Georgia to gaze upon a mysterious monument known as The Georgia Guidestones; which carries a warning issued to all of us by our present Earth rulers, written in 8 different languages, and which for those who wish the truest knowledge of these times will understand these words of the elite etched in stone:
Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
Guide reproduction wisely - improving fitness and diversity.
Unite humanity with a living new language.
Rule passion - faith - tradition - and all things with tempered reason.
Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.
Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a one world court
Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
Balance personal rights with social duties.

BUSH SE PREPARA PARA EL ARMAGEDON, ADVIERTE ALTO GENERAL RUSO
Por: Sorcha Faal y como lo informo a sus suscriptores occidentales
En un informe con palabras ""fuertes"" entregado al Kremlin el día de hoy, el
Jefe del Estado Mayor de Rusia, el General Yuri Baluyevski, ha lanzado una
advertencia al Presidente Medvedev de que los Estados Unidos se están
""preparando por completo"" para el Armagedón.
El General Baluyevski, indican estos informes, expresó su advertencia
después de su regreso de la región Georgiana separatista de Abkhazia, y
donde él, además, sealó que:
""La única decisión hoy que podría detener... un conflicto militar en Georgia
es poner un alto a la militarización de Georgia. Desafortunadamente, en los
aos y meses recientes esto ha continuado creciendo...""
En una rara coincidencia de cronología con la advertencia del General
Baluyevski, esta semana, el Presidente de los Estados Unidos estuvo, de
hecho, reconociendo el campo de batalla del Monte Megiddo (Armagedón) junto
con el Primer Ministro Israelí, Ehud Olmert (ambos en la foto superior
izquierda) lugar en el que los historiadores creen se han librado más
batallas que en cualquier otro sitio de la Tierra y en el que muchos creen
se llevará a cabo la batalla final del mundo en un futuro muy cercano.
Además el Presidente Estadounidense inflamó a los favorecedores de la Guerra
Total con sus impactantes declaraciones hechas al Knesset Israelí, como lo
informa el servicio noticioso del Christian Science Monitor:
""Este combate se libra con la tecnología del siglo 21 pero su núcleo es la
antigua batalla entre el bien y el mal, los asesinos sostienen estar bajo el
manto del Islam pero no son hombres religiosos"".
Su preparado discurso estuvo cargado con imaginería religiosa, trazando un
cuadro espiritual e ideológico de una íntima relación Estados Unidos-Israel
que pareció no tener precedentes con ningún otro discurso de algún otro
Presidente Estadounidense, dicen los analistas"".
Sin embargo, los Economistas Rusos continúan informando que los Estados
Unidos y sus Aliados Occidentales ""virtualmente no tienen otra opción"" que
la de meter al mundo en una Guerra Total al colapsarse sus economías, un
punto que ha sido hecho todavía más riguroso con la Reserva Federal
Estadounidense informando hoy que sus préstamos a los bancos Estadounidenses
para evitar su caída, han llegado a niveles récord.
Todavía más desestabilizante para las potencias occidentales es la creciente
crisis de combustible mundial y ahora México, uno de sus más importantes
exportadores de petróleo, ha lanzado una ""advertencia"" de que están
enfrentando una ""severa crisis de energía"".
La crisis financiera occidental combinada con la crisis de combustible
mundial se une a la crisis alimentaria mundial, y como lo presentamos en
nuestro reporte del 7 de mayo pasado ""Se Teme Hambre Mundial por las
Catástrofes de Myanmar y Chile"", está llevando rápidamente a un
desplazamiento catastrófico de más de 100 millones de seres humanos que
buscan por el mundo alimento y agua.
Y hoy, se reportan más de 200,000 muertos en las regiones productoras de
arroz más importantes en Asia, y con más de 50,000 reportados muertos en el
corazón de la región agrícola más productiva en el corazón de la China donde
más de 4.3 millones de hogares fueron destruidos, el Príncipe Carlos del
Reino Unido ha hecho pública una de las advertencias más espantosas
declarando que a nuestro mundo sólo le quedan 18 meses para evitar un
desastre por el cambio climático.
No se deben de olvidar las calamidades actuales de nuestro planeta por el
virus mortal que está matando a los nios en China (donde han muerto 42 y
más de 25,000 continúan enfermos) y el virus mortal de la Influenza Aviar
H5N1 que ha reclamado las vidas de otros dos nios en Indonesia y sólo por
mencionar dos de las crecientes cantidades de enfermedades y virus que están
acosando el mundo entero.
Los seres humanos no son los únicos en la devastación de la Tierra como
ahora lo informa el Fondo Mundial para la Vida Silvestre (World Wildlife
Fund) de que la vida silvestre está desapareciendo de nuestro planeta a ""una
tasa catastrófico"" con todo un tercio de todas nuestras especies animales
que ha desaparecido para siempre.
Pero, para una mayor comprensión de estas cosas y un vil portento para el
futuro de nuestra raza humana, uno sólo tiene que trepar una colina en la
región del estado de Georgia de los Estados Unidos para mirar un misterioso
monumento conocido como las Piedras Guía de Georgia, que lleva una
advertencia hecha a todos nosotros por parte de los actuales gobernantes del
mundo, escrita en 8 diferentes idiomas y para aquellos que desean el más
verdadero conocimiento de estos tiempos comprenderán estas palabras  de la
élite grabadas en piedra:
Mantengan a la humanidad debajo de 500'000,000 en perpetuo equilibrio con la
naturaleza.
Guíen la reproducción con prudencia - mejorando la condición física y la
diversidad
Unan a la humanidad con un nuevo lenguaje viviente.
Gobiernen la pasión - la fe - la tradición - y todas las cosas con templada
razón
Protejan a la gente y a las naciones con leyes justas y cortes imparciales.
Permitan que todos los países gobiernen internamente resolviendo sus
disputas externas en una corte mundial.
Eviten las leyes triviales y los funcionarios inútiles
Equilibren los derechos personales con las obligaciones sociales.
Premien la verdad - la belleza - el amor - buscando la armonía con el
infinito
No sean un cáncer para la Tierra - Dejen espacio para la naturaleza - Dejen
espacio para la naturaleza
En estos tiempos y es triste decirlo, uno debe preguntarse si se encuentra
entre los 500 millones a los que se les permitirá vivir o entre los 6.1
billones agendados para morir.

"Britain may send troops to train Syrian rebels who are battling both Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s forces and Islamic State (IS, formerly known as ISIS or ISIL) militants, the Independent reports. This follows a similar abortive attempt in 2011.
The news comes as the Pentagon announced plans for a US-led campaign to train rebels, with the ambition of garnering support from the international community. To take on IS extremists, officials say an infantry of up to 15,000 fighters may be needed.
Jordan is considered a likely location for such training, as the UK already holds a base there at which it trains that country’s military. Peshmerga Kurdish fighters and the Free Syrian Army, which are seen as “moderate” Syrian opposition rebels, would be trained by CIA-funded security contractors.
In support of a US-led campaign, ministers approved UK airstrikes against IS positions in northern Iraq last Friday. Most of the strikes by RAF Tornado jets have hit IS vehicles.
Prime Minister David Cameron has said repeatedly that Britain would not commit any boots on the ground in Iraq or Syria to battle IS. However, around 150 British military personnel are already said to be on the ground in Iraq, chiefly for advisory purposes, including members of the SAS and SBS.
This is not the first time the British government has sought to arm and train the Syrian opposition. In July this year, a BBC Newsnight investigation revealed that Britain had planned to train and equip a 100,000-strong rebel army in 2011 to overthrow Assad, before officials decided the plan was too risky.
General David Richards, then-Chief of the Defense Staff, drew up the secret ‘extract, equip, train’ plans.
As the UK government considers its role in the Pentagon’s rebel training plans, the vast and complex nature of factional opposition groups within Syria makes choosing dependable allies extremely difficult.
For instance, the Syrian-based militant group Al-Nusra Front, an offshoot of Al-Qaeda, has been fighting against IS in tandem with allegedly pro-Western groups. However, its positions have been targeted in US-led airstrikes.",1
"Taking the right antibiotics for just nine months may be as effective against drug-resistant tuberculosis as taking them for two years, as is currently recommended, according to preliminary findings from an international study.
Results from the trial, which is overseen by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and UCL (formerly the University College London), were released at a conference in Mexico. The trial includes 424 patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis in Ethiopia, Mongolia, South Africa and Vietnam.
There were “favorable outcomes” in about 78 percent of those treated for nine months, the authors said — close to the 81 percent success rate observed in clinical trials using the two-year regimen. The short regimen also appeared to work in patients co-infected with H. I.V.
The study, paid for by the American and British governments, is an effort to see if a nine-month treatment that appeared to cure 88 percent of patients in a trial in Bangladesh a decade ago was a fluke or a repeatable success. That study had too many flaws for the World Health Organization to consider adopting the combination.
Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is a growing problem, affecting about 480,000 people, the W. H.O. estimates. Tuberculosis specialists are eager to find safe, effective shortcuts to cure patients.
Patients with even uncomplicated tuberculosis must take four drugs a day for six months. Treating drug-resistant tuberculosis can require in-hospital intravenous infusions and toxic second-line antibiotics that may cause nausea, deafness, liver damage and other side effects that lead patients to drop out of treatment.

"What began 16 months ago as a scandal involving the alleged theft of computer equipment from Congress has turned into a full-blown national security investigation involving FBI surveillance of the suspects. Now, former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is screwed, as the public has finally discoveredwhat an IT staffer took from her office.
As the left worked to downplay the scandal, conservatives suspected all along that classified information was likely compromised when Pakistani IT staffers working for Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other Democrat members of the House “misplaced” hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of computer equipment that they were supposed to be working on. Unfortunately, it appears that we were right, and this certainly isn’t a time where it feels good to say, “I told you so.”
Investigators now suspect that sensitive US government data — possibly including classified information — could have been compromised and may have been sold to hostile foreign governments that could use it to blackmail members of Congress or even put their lives at risk. [Source: New York Post]
“This is a massive, massive scandal,” said a senior US official. “These lawmakers allowed an insider threat to come into the House. Computer equipment was stolen, taxpayers were robbed of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and sensitive data was compromised and possibly sold overseas,” the official added.
“Logic dictates that sensitive data was compromised,” the senior official speculated. “An accused criminal with close ties to Pakistan had full and complete control over data that went out over the network.”
That “accused criminal” isImran Awan, who, along with his ever-loving wife, was just indicted for bank fraud.
A grand jury late Thursday returned an indictment in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia charging Imran Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, of Lorton, Virginia, on four counts: conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, making false statements on a loan or credit application and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions.
Awan, 37, previously had been charged in a criminal complaint with one count of bank fraud. The indictment expanded on the charges and also added Alvi, 33, as a defendant.
The indictment states that Awan and Alvi conspired to obtain home equity lines of credit for $165,000 and $120,000 from a credit union on two properties. They provided false information that the properties were Alvi’s principal residence and second home when they actually rented out the homes. Then, they transferred the proceeds to Pakistan. [Source: Miami Herald]
So, to sum this all up for you, the Democrats have been attacking Trump for months over supposed collusion with Russia to rig the 2016 election, for which there is absolutely no proof. Meanwhile, the Democrats allowed a shady Muslim IT staffer to steal classified information off of governmentcomputers and give it to foreign governments, like Pakistan and Russia.
And, they want to see Trump impeached… They ought to take a glance in the mirror if they’re looking for someone to boot out of office.",1
"JPMorgan Software Does in Seconds What Took Lawyers 360,000 Hours
New software does in seconds what took staff 360,000 hours
At JPMorgan Chase & Co., a learning machine is parsing financial deals that once kept legal teams busy for thousands of hours. The program, called COIN, for Contract Intelligence, does the mind-numbing job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that, until the project went online in June, consumed 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers. The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error-prone and never asks for vacation.Attendees discuss software on Feb. 27, the eve of JPMorgan’s Investor Day.While the financial industry has long touted its technological innovations, a new era of automation is now in overdrive as cheap computing power converges withfears of losing customers to startups. Made possible by investments in machine learning and a new private cloud network, COIN is just the start for the biggest U.S. bank. The firm recently set up technology hubs for teams specializing in big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure to find new sources of revenue, while reducing expenses and risks.
The push to automate mundane tasks and create new tools for bankers and clients -- a growing part of the firm’s $9.6 billion technology budget -- is a core theme as the company hosts its annual investor day on Tuesday.Behind the strategy, overseen by Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames and Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy, is an undercurrent of anxiety: Though JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis as one of few big winners, its dominance is at risk unless it aggressively pursues new technologies, according to interviews with a half-dozen bank executives.That was the message Zames had for Deasy when he joined the firm fromBP Plc in late 2013. The New York-based bank’s internal systems, an amalgam from decades of mergers, had too many redundant software programs that didn’t work together seamlessly.
“Matt said, ‘Remember one thing above all else: We absolutely need to be the leaders in technology across financial services,’” Deasy said last week in an interview. “Everything we’ve done from that day forward stems from that meeting.”
After visiting companies including Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. three years ago to understand how their developers worked, the bank set out to create its own computing cloud called Gaia that went online last year.Machine learning and big-data efforts now reside on the private platform, which effectively has limitless capacity to support their thirst for processing power.The system already is helping the bank automate some coding activities and making its 20,000 developers more productive, saving money, Zames said. When needed, the firm can also tap into outside cloud services from Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.JPMorgan will make some of its cloud-backed technology available to institutional clients later this year, allowing firms like BlackRock Inc. to access balances, research and trading tools. The move, which lets clients bypass salespeople and support staff for routine information, is similar to one Goldman Sachs Group Inc. announced in 2015.JPMorgan’s total technology budget for this year amounts to 9 percent of its projected revenue -- double the industry average, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck. The dollar figure has inched higher as JPMorgan bolsters cyber defenses after a 2014 data breach, which exposed the information of 83 million customers.“We have invested heavily in technology and marketing -- and we are seeing strong returns,” JPMorgan said in a presentation Tuesday ahead of its investor day, noting that technology spending in its consumer bank totaled about $1 billion over the past two years.One-third of the company’s budget is for new initiatives, a figure Zames wants to take to 40 percent in a few years. He expects savings from automation and retiring old technology will let him plow even more money into new innovations.Not all of those bets, which include several projects based on a distributed ledger, like blockchain, will pay off, which JPMorgan says is OK. One example executives are fond of mentioning: The firm built an electronic platform to help trade credit-default swaps that sits unused.“We’re willing to invest to stay ahead of the curve, even if in the final analysis some of that money will go to product or a service that wasn’t needed,” Marianne Lake, the lender’s finance chief, told a conference audience in June. That’s “because we can’t wait to know what the outcome, the endgame, really looks like, because the environment is moving so fast.”As for COIN, the program has helped JPMorgan cut down on loan-servicing mistakes, most of which stemmed from human error in interpreting 12,000 new wholesale contracts per year, according to its designers.JPMorgan is scouring for more ways to deploy the technology, which learns by ingesting data to identify patterns and relationships. The bank plans to use it for other types of complex legal filings like credit-default swaps and custody agreements. Someday, the firm may use it to help interpret regulations and analyze corporate communications.Another program called X-Connect, which went into use in January, examines e-mails to help employees find colleagues who have the closest relationships with potential prospects and can arrange introductions.For simpler tasks, the bank has created bots to perform functions like granting access to software systems and responding to IT requests, such as resetting an employee’s password, Zames said. Bots are expected to handle 1.7 million access requests this year, doing the work of 140 people.While growing numbers of people in the industry worry such advancements might someday take their jobs, many Wall Street personnel are more focused on benefits. A survey of more than 3,200 financial professionals by recruiting firm Options Group last year found a majority expect new technology will improve their careers, for example by improving workplace performance.Click here for Options Group’s survey on technology’s impact“Anything where you have back-office operations and humans kind of moving information from point A to point B that’s not automated is ripe for that,” Deasy said. “People always talk about this stuff as displacement. I talk about it as freeing people to work on higher-value things, which is why it’s such a terrific opportunity for the firm.”To help spur internal disruption, the company keeps tabs on 2,000 technology ventures, using about 100 in pilot programs that will eventually join the firm’s growing ecosystem of partners. For instance, the bank’s machine-learning software was built with Cloudera Inc., a software firm that JPMorgan first encountered in 2009.“We’re starting to see the real fruits of our labor,” Zames said. “This is not pie-in-the-sky stuff.”

Investor With 30% in Cash Says North Korea Selloff Will Come",0
"The White House is planning a “big immigration launch” Tuesday morning that will focus on the implementation of the recent Department of Homeland Security proposal that called for the hiring of thousands of officers and fast-tracking deportations, a senior administration official said.
The DHS plan was signed Friday by the agency’s new secretary, John Kelly. If approved by President Trump, it would give federal authorities more power to aggressively detain and deport illegal immigrants inside the country and along U. S. borders.
Kelly called for 10,000 additional ICE officers and agents and 5,000 new hires at the U. S. Customs and Border Protection agency.
“The surge of immigration at the southern border has overwhelmed federal agencies and resources and has created a significant national security vulnerability to the United States,” wrote Kelly, citing 10,000 to 15,000 more apprehensions along that border between 2015 and 2016.
He also wrote that building a wall along the entire U. S.-Mexico border, as Trump has called for, “necessary.”
Former President Obama’s executive orders on illegal immigration focused on deporting those with criminal records and terrorist connections.
“Criminal aliens have demonstrated their disregard for the rule of law and pose a threat to persons residing in the United States,” Kelly writes in the memorandums. “As such criminal aliens are a priority for removal.”
The expanded relationship with local law enforcement would be carried out through what is known as 287(g) — a section on the federal Immigration and Nationality Act that allows DHS to deputize state and local law-enforcement officers so they can function as federal immigration agents.
“Regardless of the White House’s response, this document is an absolutely accurate description of the disturbing mindset that pervades the Trump administration when it comes to our nation’s immigrants,” said U. S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.)
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he would have “concerns about the utilization of National Guard resources for immigration enforcement,” believing such a program “would be too much of a strain on our National Guard personnel.”

"Even with possession shaming, and amid the fear and threat of prosecution, Australians have yet to give up all their guns. It is estimated nearly300,000 gunsare still on the streets in the land down under. These guns don’t belong to the law-abiding citizens either.
Australia’s anti-gun campaign and propaganda launched after a mass shooter killed 35 people in one heinous act of murder. The tragedy took place in 1996, in the city of Port Arthur. Following the crime, and in the wake of national agony, then Prime Minister John Howard moved to take back all the gun rights Australians had since the country’s founding.
Now, over twenty years later, the government of Australia is still actively seeking to root out Aussie guns, with limited success. As a method of doing so, Australia is offering amnesty to anyone who now wishes to come forward and surrender theirfirearms. More than 6,000 weapons have been turned in over the last month and a half. According to one source:
Among the firearms surrendered tolaw enforcement thus far are 1,700 rifles, 460 shotguns and almost 200 handguns; that includes such novelties asfour SKS assault rifles, a 9 mm submachine-gun, a Colt AR-15 rifle, an M1 carbine and a 0.44 caliber magnum revolver. Thousands ofother illicit firearms were handed infor registration.
The amnesty program will continue until September 30th, at which time, presumably, the criminal penalties for possessing a firearm will resume including fines up to $220,000 and 14 years in prison.
Australia’s suicide rate by firearm plummeted as a result of Howard’s unilateral reforms. And murders by firearms fell as well. But according one news source, that data ismixed and hotly disputed.
Those who wish to see America follow Australia’s model have a tough time making a case for wholesale gun confiscation and buyback programs, mainly because the U. S. Constitution explicitly protects gun ownership. Supporters point to Australia’s homicide and suicide rates as a motivating factor for disarming Americans, yet asThe Federalistpoints out, Australia still has a serious problem with violent crime:
Manslaughter, sexual assault, kidnapping, armed robbery, and unarmed robbery all saw peaks in the years following the ban, and most remain near or above pre-ban rates. The effects of the 1996 ban on violent crime are, frankly, unimpressive at best.
Recently, Australiafoiled a terror plotby ISIS operatives who allegedly plotted to blow up an Australian airliner. During the subsequent investigation, authorities discovered yet another plot to gas Australians with hydrogen sulfide and a sophisticated dispersion device. Unfortunately, while no one with a handgun could likely have prevented either plot, Australians are helpless to defend themselves from both street thugs and terrorists alike.
All of this raises the age-old question of whether or not individuals have individual liberties to defend themselves by any means necessary. It is foolish to believe any police force, in any country, can protect everyone at any time from violence. Libertarianism must roll back the egregious gun policies in Australia which have left those down under with no way to protect themselves.
The UK’s response to the self-defense amid the growing threat of terrorism is a public service announcement called “Run, Hide, and Tell.” The National Counter Terrorism Security Office suggested citizens should run away from the danger, cower in some safe place, and then call the police, who will arrive with firearms to deal with the threat. But such a policy may not sit well with Americans who are armed to the teeth.
Stand, Fight, and Quell the threat is the attitude many armed Americans have when it comes to the threat of gun violence, and terrorism in towns and cities. States like Arizona take such a policy very seriously, allowing for citizens to carry firearms at all times.
For example, following terrorist attacks and massacres in Paris, Beirut and Mali in 2015, sheriffs and police chiefs across the countryurged Americans to go out and buy guns— and engage terrorists when and if they attempted to wreak havoc. That’s the American way.

"A sweeping overhaul of the tax code unveiled by House Republicans on Thursday would cap the deduction for property taxes at $10,000 and preserve the mortgage interest deduction only for existing mortgages and new purchases with loans of $500,000 or less.
Those changes will amount to a tax increase on high-income taxpayers with pricey homes, even if they get lower income tax rates.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas,said the change was being made to drive tax relief to middle income families, but it also will go to offset lower corporate rates that sponsors believe will spur the economy and job creation.
The plan maintains the existing top bracket of 39.6% for households earning more than $1 million, Brady said. There would no tax charged on household income less than $24,000;a12% rate would be charged on income from $24,000 to $90,000; 25% on $90,000 to $260,000; and 35% on $260,000 to $1 million, he said.
Rates would be different for single people and single heads of households.
“This is the beginning of the end of this horrible tax code,” Brady said as he entered a briefing with House members Thursday morning.
Brady said the tax plan would reduce tax revenues over the coming decade by $1.5 trillion, a target set in a budget resolution that both chambers approved earlier this month. Republicans argue that the cuts will spur economic growth that willoffset those reduced revenues.
The plan would nearly double the standard deduction, from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly.The personal exemptions in the tax code now, worth $4,050for each taxpayer, spouse and dependent, would be eliminated.
A new family credit of $1,600 would replace the existing child tax credit of $1,000, and there would be $300 credits for each parent and non-child dependent, such as an elderly parent. The income cap for the credits would also be increased from $110,000 for a married couple to $230,000.
Retirement savings plans such as 401(k)s would be not be changed, Brady said. Taxpayers who itemize could also continue to deduct for charitable contributions, though organizations representing nonprofits havewarned that the higher standard deduction might make people less motivated to donate.
Brady said other deductions and loopholes would be eliminated but those details were not immediately released.
The bill's introductionkeeps Republicans on an aggressive schedule to try to winHouse passage by Thanksgiving and enactment by President Trumpby Christmas.But it came after two days of intense negotiations over differences within the House GOP conference, which led to some decisions that may not stand when the Senate takes up the bill.
“We’re gonna get this done, you know why? Because the American people are counting on us,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.
President Trump, in a statement released by the White House, said applauded the release of the plan and said he was ready to fight for it.
""We are just getting started, and there is much work left to do,"" he said. ""The special interests will distort the facts, the lobbyists will try to save their special deals, and some in the media will unfairly report on our efforts.But my Administration will work tirelessly to make good on our promise to the working people.""
Why are Republicans suddenly willing to embrace $1.5 trillion in new debt?
Are you middle class enough to get a tax cut from President Trump's plan?
The top corporate tax rate would be reduced immediately from 35% to 20%, and companies would be able to take an immediate write-off for investments in new equipment, retroactive to mid-September.
The plan also creates a new 25% rate for small-business owners, sole proprietors and partnerships that report business income on personal tax returns, but Brady said there would be rules to prevent abuse by wealthy people who could try to portray their personal income as business income to avoid the 39.6% personal tax rate.
The plan repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax, which mostly hits higher income taxpayers by reducing the value of other deductions in the code. On the estate tax, the plan would immediately double the $5 million exemptionand phase it out over six years.
The GOP won a narrow 216-212 victory in the House last week on a budget resolution that laid the foundation for the tax overhaul by including language to block a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Republicans can pas the bill with no Democratic support in either chamber, if they can get their own party in line behind it.
Among the 20 Republican ""no"" votes on the budget were 11 New Jersey and New York representatives, who said they could notaccept proposalsto eliminate the deduction for state and local income, sales and property taxes.
Over the weekend, Brady conceded that some the deduction for property taxes would be retained, but not the one for state income or sales taxes. One New Jersey Republican who had broken with the party on the budget seemed to be won over by the change.
""There's a lot of ways you could look at this, but one headline is we won,"" said Rep. Tom MacArthur.
But Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-N. J., was not convinced.
""The elimination of state and local income tax deductions and the $10,000 cap on property tax deductions would be detrimental to New Jersey residents,"" he said. ""This bill is not something I could support in its current form.""
A provision to discourage multinational companies from incorporating overseas while selling their products in the United States was assailed as a backdoor tax on consumers by the advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, whichcalled the bill dead on arrival.
But Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina, who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee, was satisfied with what he had heard.
“Without trying to ... sugar coat it, it’s extremely positive,” Walker told reporters, describing group's reaction to the bill overall.
Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, also shrugged off concerns that the committee had included a version of the border adjustment tax, which tax-writers had considered and abandoned.
The BAT was “a sales tax at the border of 18%,"" Brat said. ""There’s nothing of that scope or nature.”
Democrats say the process is being rushedandasked in a letter Wednesday that Bradypostpone a hearing on the bill set for Monday in the Ways andMeans Committee.
""Reforming our nation's tax code will fundamentally reorganize 100 percent of the United States economy,"" wrote Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the committee.

"RIAD, Arabia Saudita — Los grupos de derechos humanos la atacaron; los conservadores la defendieron; los comediantes la mencionaban en sus canciones; un rey prometió acabar con ella pero se murió sin hacerlo. Luego, en un anuncio transmitido por la televisión estatal, las autoridades de Arabia Saudita dijeron que finalmente abolieron la prohibición que impedía que las mujeres condujeran autos.
Aunque el cambio no entrará en vigor sino hasta junio de 2018, el anuncio fue tan abrupto que asombró al país. Muchos sauditas se volcaron a las redes sociales el miércoles de la semana pasada para expresar su alegría o su consternación sobre el final de la prohibición y debatir qué otras medidas podrían relajarse próximamente.
“No resolvió todos los problemas, pero hizo que haya uno menos”, dijo Muna AbuSulayman, una presentadora de la televisión saudita. Dijo que el cambio constituye “un paso hacia ser ciudadanas completas”.
Durante décadas, el asunto de que las mujeres pudieran conducir fue un elemento clave en la lucha sobre la naturaleza del Estado saudita y su futuro.
Arabia Saudita, un país forjado sobre la base de una alianza entre una familia real y los descendientes de un clérigo musulmán ultraconservador, ha batallado a lo largo de su historia con el proceso de reconciliar la modernización con su lealtad a la herencia religiosa.
Ese debate aumentó conforme la abundancia petrolera enriqueció al país, trayendo consigo costumbres desconocidas y tecnologías como la televisión, la educación pública y los automóviles.
Para los liberales, la prohibición de conducir era una mancha nacional que dificultaba la modernización y debilitaba la economía. Los conservadores, incluidos los poderosos clérigos que trabajan para el Estado, pensaban que permitir que las mujeres condujeran era un paso hacia la secularización que podría acabar con la peculiar identidad islámica del reino.
El decreto real le dio una victoria a los reformistas que, en los últimos aos, han obtenido una ventaja por las características demográficas, la economía y la joven dirigencia del país, según los analistas.
Los líderes sauditas, a quienes se ha criticado por la guerra en Yemen, el bloqueo a Catar y varios asuntos de derechos humanos, claramente esperan que la medida ayude a mejorar la reputación del reino.
“No hay momento equivocado para hacer lo correcto”, dijo a los reporteros el príncipe Khalid bin Salmán, embajador saudita en Washington e hijo del rey Salmán, después de que se anunció la medida.
El gobierno trabajó tras bambalinas para controlar el mensaje. Por lo menos ocho activistas prominentes de la causa de las mujeres recibieron llamadas y mensajes de texto de funcionarios de seguridad que les advertían no tuitear ni hablar a los medios de comunicación sobre el asunto, según tres activistas sauditas.
Supusieron que las autoridades no querían darle crédito a las activistas por promover el cambio y hablaron con la condición de que se respetara su anonimato para no ponerse en peligro.
Manal al Sherif, a quien encarcelaron por divulgar videos de ella conduciendo y que escribió un libro sobre su activismo, dijo que su vida ha seguido los grandes cambios sociales del reino.
Nacida dentro de una familia conservadora y pobre en La Meca, Sherif, ahora de 38 aos, aprendió que las mujeres debían permanecer en casa y que los buenos musulmanes debían rechazar a los “infieles” que no compartieran su fe, dijo por teléfono desde Australia, donde vive ahora.
Su cosmovisión cambió cuando, como universitaria en la ciudad portea de Yeda, cerca del mar Rojo, vio a mujeres que no cubrían sus rostros en público e incluso tenían novio, aunque a escondidas.
Luego consiguió un empleo en la empresa petrolera estatal Saudi Aramco. En su extenso complejo, las mujeres disfrutaban de más libertades que en ningún otro sitio del reino, incluso podían conducir.
Dijo que la condición de las mujeres en Arabia Saudita ha sido usada por el gobierno a lo largo de los aos para aplacar a los conservadores.
“Nuestros derechos siempre se habían usado en el juego político y eso es lo que queríamos que terminara”, dijo. “Realmente eso mantenía al país atrasado”.
Les dio el crédito al rey Salmán y al príncipe heredero Mohamed bin Salmán, otro de los hijos del rey, por tomar decisiones necesarias para que el reino avance.
“El gobierno tomó la decisión correcta”, dijo. “Finalmente, tuvieron los pantalones para decir ‘Estábamos mal’”.
Fue difícil medir inmediatamente las reacciones a la decisión entre los sauditas más conservadores. Hace poco el gobierno arrestó a más de 24 individuos, incluyendo clérigos prominentes, algunos de los cuales habían criticado las políticas gubernamentales.
Para el mediodía del miércoles, la etiqueta en árabe “La gente rechaza a las mujeres que conducen” había aparecido en 335.000 tuits, mientras que la etiqueta “Victoria al rey por permitir a las mujeres conducir” solo había aparecido en 33.700, según Twitter.
Sin embargo, muchos usuarios emplearon las etiquetas para unirse a discusiones, aunque no estuvieran de acuerdo con su mensaje.
Incluso quienes habían hecho campaa durante mucho tiempo dijeron que esperaban algo de resistencia.
“Somos un país religioso”, dijo Fawziah al Bakr, una profesora que ha hecho campaa a favor del derecho a conducir durante casi tres décadas.
Sin embargo, la religión no tiene nada que ver con el asunto, dijo, y sealó que las mujeres en otros países predominantemente musulmanes como Egipto, Sudán y Pakistán han estado conduciendo desde hace mucho.
“Todas estas mujeres son musulmanas y de todas formas manejan”, dijo. “No poder conducir no tiene nada que ver con el islam”.
Algunas reformas anteriores se toparon también con una gran resistencia en el reino. Los conservadores hicieron campaa en contra de la introducción de la televisión, pues temían que llenara las casas sauditas con imágenes no islámicas.
Ahora muchos clérigos sauditas tienen sus propios programas y son usuarios entusiastas de las redes sociales. También trataron de evitar la educación para las nias. Ahora muchas de sus hijas estudian en universidades sauditas o incluso en Estados Unidos.
Para muchas mujeres sauditas, ganar el derecho a conducir no significa el fin de la batalla. Muchas esperan que el próximo paso del gobierno sea eliminar las llamadas “leyes de guardia”, que requieren que las mujeres cuenten con el permiso de un “guardián” de sexo masculino para obtener un pasaporte, viajar al extranjero o someterse a ciertos procedimientos médicos.
Eso podría tomar tiempo pero AbuSulayman, la presentadora de televisión, dijo que el camino es claro.
Alrededor de dos tercios de los 22 millones de ciudadanos del reino tienen menos de 30 aos y crecerán viendo a las mujeres de forma diferente que sus mayores, dijo. Muchos no recordarán cuando las mujeres no podían conducir.
“En realidad odio manejar”, dijo riendo, pero de todas formas planea conseguir una licencia saudita para conducir.",0
"Hurricane Irma is about to show whether South Florida, one of the fastest-growing parts of the United States, has done enough to protect that development.
The last monster hurricane to hit the area, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, did an estimated $25 billion in damage. Twenty-six deaths were directly attributed to the storm in Florida, the Bahamas and Louisiana, 15 of which were in the Sunshine State alone. Indirect deaths brought the overall total to 65, according to the National Hurricane Center.
Reinsurer Swiss Re said the hurricane destroyed more than 25,000 homes and damaged another 100,000.
Hurricane Andrew taught South Florida to improve its resiliency to storms. It tightened building codes so that newly built structures could withstand hurricane-force winds and developed a world-class system to help people prepare and respond to disasters.
But Hurricane Irma is much bigger than Andrew. There are about 1.3 million more people in the region. The rate of development has continued unabated, putting many more buildings at risk.

The South Florida coast, symbolized by Miami Beach's glitzy, high rise-studded waterfront, frequently suffers sunny-day floods, making it ground zero in a struggle to protect coastal cities from storms that could be increasingly destructive due to global warming and rising sea levels.
""The wind, we got that. But the water has so much more force,"" said Keren Bolter, a professor of environmental sciences at Broward College. ""Storm surges and flooding are what will cause a lot of damage in the future.""
To mark the 25th anniversary of Hurricane Andrew last month, insurance firm Swiss Re analyzed what kind of damage the storm would have done today. It projected that the cost would be more than $50 billion in insured losses alone. If the region's system of man-made drainage structures failed, the losses would double or triple, the firm said.
Making matters more complicated is that many who have moved to South Florida have no experience dealing with a big hurricane. An estimated 500,000 people arrived from 2011 to 2016, including a large portion of people from other countries, according to a 2016 analysis by the Miami Herald.
The last major hurricane to hit South Florida was Wilma, a category 3 storm in 2005.
That means Irma is the first big storm for many new residents.
""It's hard for people who haven’t experienced this before,"" said Tisha Holmes, an assistant professor at Florida State University's Department of Urban and Regional Planning. ""There's some inertia because they don’t understand the gravity of the situation.""
Isabel Cosio Carballo, executive director of the South Florida Regional Planning Council, pointed out that many people in South Florida ─ newly arrived or not ─ can't afford to properly protect themselves from Irma.
She cited a recent report by the United Way of Florida that found 61 percent of households in Miami-Dade County, and 44 percent in Broward County, were either poor or working poor, meaning they struggled to pay basic bills ─ let alone survive for a disaster.
That's a level of vulnerability that often gets overlooked, Cosio Carballo said.
""Some people don’t have cars, or jobs that give them time off, or ready cash to go somewhere,"" she said. ""It's important that we aren’t judgmental about people waiting to prepare. It's not easy for a lot of them.""",0
"In war-torn South Sudan, 1.25 million people are facing starvation, double the number from the same time last year, according to a report by the United Nations and the government released Monday.
The South Sudan crisis has not been on the front burner, reports CBS News' Pamela Falk from the U. N., but thenew reportunderscores that the food emergency will get worse, not better, and that over half of the total population is facing a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""
This country could once again plunge into famine in 2018, warn humanitarian groups and the government.
""The widespread and extreme food consumption gaps ... should make us all extremely concerned about the worst case scenario of famine in many locations across South Sudan in 2018,"" said Katie Rickard, country coordinator for REACH, a humanitarian research initiative that provided data for the report.
Humanitarian organizations blame the worsening situation on South Sudan's continuing conflict, which is nearing its fifth year and has killed more than 50,000 people.
In February, the world's youngest nation declared famine in two counties in Unity State, the world's first formal famine declaration since Somalia in 2011. In South Sudan's two counties, 100,000 people were on the brink of starvation, but thanks to early detection and a rapid response, catastrophe was avoided, said the World Food Program.
However, the latest food and security analysis update by the U. N and South Sudan's National Bureau of Statistics is grim.
As of September, 6 million people — 56 percent of the population — were experiencing severe hunger with 25,000 South Sudanese in humanitarian catastrophe in Ayod and Greater Baggari counties.
South Sudan's widening war has made food production impossible and delivery of aid dangerous and difficult. Both Ayod and Baggari are rebel-held areas and locals say the situation in the two counties is dire.
""We ran out because of the hunger,"" said a resident of Baggari who recently fled with his family to the nearby town of Wau because they didn't have any food. He spoke on condition of anonymity for his safety. The 52-year-old father of four told AP by phone that people are ""dying of hunger"" and in the last year and a half he only saw humanitarians enter Baggari town three times.
""If the government doesn't approve of people coming in to help what can we do? We have nothing, we can just pray,"" he said.",0
"Can a road-legal car be powered by the Sun alone? One company thinks so, and they’re planning to unveil a scaled-down version of their proposal later this year.
Called “The Immortus,”the two-person vehicle is the work of EVX Ventures, an electric vehicle technology startup based in Melbourne, Australia. The car is decked out in solar panels, covering up to eight square meters (86 square feet), and also has a lithium battery to store energy, between five and 10 kilowatt-hours. So light is the car though, 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) when empty and 700 kilograms(1,550 pounds) when fully laden, it is able to run on just solar power alone.
This is all possible thanks to the low mass-to-power ratio of the car. It is also extremely aerodynamic while still looking “compelling and stylish,” EVX co-founder and CEO Barry Nguyen said to IFLScience. The car also doesn’t use normal road tires, but rather tires specially designed for so-called “solar racers”– cars that are powered by the Sun.
Using a combination of battery and solar power, the car will apparently be capable of reaching up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour. On solar power alone, it can reach up to 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour.
And perhaps most interestingly, Nguyen said that the car would be able to run perpetually on just solar power, giving it an infinite range, in theory, so long as it didn’t exceed 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour and the Sun was continuously shining. Still, that’s pretty impressive. However, Nguyen stressed that the idea of the technology was to use solar cells in tandem with existing vehicles.
“We see the solar cells as a range extender technology in everyday driving, rather than the solar cells capturing more energy thanit consumes for practical use,” he said. “However, uniquely, the range is infinite when there is consistent sunshine cruising at 60 km/h.”
EVX plans to unveil a one-quarter scaled version of their car at the SEMA Show 2015 at the Las Vegas Convention Center in November. A leading electric vehicle research and development group at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne is also involved in the project.
When it is eventually released, Nguyen said the car is expected to retail for about $370,000 (240,000), and sales of more than 100 are not expected. The car will be road legal “under individually constructed vehicle regulations” in Australia and the U. S., according to Nguyen.
The team plans to test a full-scale version of the car by the end of 2016, providing they can raise enough money for a working prototype.",1
"“GIVE me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free/the wretched refuse of your teeming shore”. So reads “The New Colossus”, the poem by Emma Lazarus inscribed on the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour. When it comes to refugees, the most vulnerable of all the world’s migrants, America can claim to have lived up to this motto in recent years. In the decade to 2016 nearly half a million refugees were resettled in the United States under the auspices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)—a hefty 70% of total global resettlements.
These admissions represent only a minor part of the world’s refugee problem. On average, UNHCR has resettled about 70,000 refugees per year between 2007 and 2016. But the organisation classifies a total of about 22m people as refugees, and counts 66m under a broader definition of “forcibly displaced people”. Most are sheltering in states close to their own countries. Some make their way overland, or by sea, to European and other countries, where they seek asylum upon arrival.
Combining data on grants of asylum and refugee resettlement, America formally approved around 110,000 requests in the most recent year for whichdata is available (85,000 refugees and 26,000 asylum-seekers). In contrast, European countries accepted 54,000 requests in 2016 (38,000 asylum applications and16,000 UNHCR refugees). However, far more people seek asylum in Europe than in America: there were about 1.2m applications in the European Union in 2016 alone. And many of those who are rejected still remain, because they cannot be safely repatriated.
Yet even within the limited UNHCR resettlement programme, a clear example of historical American leadership, the country’s contribution is shrinking precipitously. For the first time since 2003 (when UNHCR’s online data series begins), the country’s share of refugee resettlements is set to fall to less than half the globaltotal. In the first eight months of 2017 just 41% went to America. Britain has filled some of the gap; it has taken in nearly 10% of resettlements this year, up from an average of 1% between 2003 and 2014. That has propelled Britain to third place, ahead of Australia and behind only America and Canada.
President Donald Trump has had less success at changing the composition of refugees admitted to America than he has at reducing the inflow. In December 2015 he called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”. In office, the first version of his troubled travel ban, targeting visitors from seven mostly-Muslim countries, made exceptions mainly for members of religious minorities from those countries. However, after the courts blocked the implementation of that policy, Mr Trump issued a revised executive order without religious preferences.
The latest numbers suggest that the religious mix of refugees arriving in America has remained fairly constant. According to data released on October 12th by the Pew Research Centre, in the year to October 2016 the United States took in slightly more Muslim refugees than Christian ones. During the past year, the ranking has reversed, but not by much: 25,000 Christian refugees and 23,000 Muslim ones have gained admission.",0
"JUST IN: 10 000 MUSLIMS DEPORTED IN TEN MINUTES, SCREAMING AND LYING ON THE GROUND
JUST IN: 10 000 MUSLIMS DEPORTED IN TEN MINUTES, SCREAMING AND LYING ON THE GROUND
After years — decades in fact — of open immigration policies welcoming millions from Muslimcountries, many European nations are now overwhelmed by the consequences.
But so long as they haveleft-wing governments those policies remain unchanged, as liberals, just likein America, use immigration and easy welfare policies to stay in power.
But nations that electconservative governments are starting to curtail and even reverse those policies welcoming Muslims– and the results are .
Once such nation is Norway, which elected the Conservative Party to power after years of open immigration policies.
The new Norwegian Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, began a program that deports Muslims who have ties to radical groups.
And something stunning occurred: the country’s violent crimes are down more than 31% in less than a year since Muslim deportations began!
Liberals everywhere are crying “Racism!” Al Jazeera has blasted Solberg relentlessly for her so-called “Islamophobia”, but she has pressed on by deporting any Muslims who belong to radical mosques or threaten violence against “non-believers” — and sent their entire families home too.
A record number of people were deported by Norwegian authorities in2014.
Norway’s government has ruled that a record 7,100 people wereto be deported in 2014, more than 10 times the number under the previous government.
Analystsbelieve some of the reasons for the rise in figures are more resources, more staff and a change of “portfolio priorities”. It has also become easier for Norwegian authorities to deport people back to Muslim nations, including Afghanistan and Nigeria.
A large percentage of those deported in 2014 were Muslim asylum seekers who had their application for continued asylum rejected. They were then deported along with their families. The majority of deportees, however, had committed crimes, or had returned illegally to Norway after being deported.
Norwegianresidents have been stunned by the violent crime rate plummeting in so rapid a time frame.
And even though the liberal media tries to hush up the reason, one resident, Adrian Stavig made it clear why the people love their new conservative leader, saying something that would give Barack Obama a coronary:
“The world’s largest gang of thugs, murderers, and rapists is masquerading as a religion of peace.”

"Whether you're headed to Washington to celebrate or protest President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20 (or the Women's March on Washington the day after), there are plenty of options available for room, board, and entertainment.
Included in the mix are traditional hotels and a wide array of rentable rooms, homes and condos offered on sites such as Airbnb, FlipKey and HomeAway. However, travelers should be prepared to pay a hefty price, as some inauguration-themed packages are budget busters.
""As we get closer to the day of the inauguration, you might see some hotels reducing the minimum night stay requirements, dropping rates a bit or throwing in extra amenities,"" said Theresa Belpulsi, vice president of tourism and visitor services at Destination DC.
The $45,000 Inauguration Celebration package at the Mayflower Hotel includes a four-night stay in the presidential suite, two tickets to the presidential inauguration and special in-room nightly amenities. (The hotel plans to donate the full room fee to the Washington-based Children's National Health System).
The Marriott Marquis Washington, D. C. is transforming its lobby into a patriotic homage to the American flag and all past U.S. presidents. It created a $75,000, four-night inauguration package that includes lodging in the White House Rose Garden-inspired presidential suite, a living red and white rose wall, a four-course dinner for eight (served in the suite), 24-hour complimentary champagne service — and fresh roses delivered nightly.
Over at the Fairmont, where there will be nightly inauguration-themed turndown amenities for all guests and complimentary post-swearing-in champagne in the lobby, there are still a few rooms available for the relatively more reasonable price of $1,200 per night.
The deadline has passed to book a $150,000, four-night ""Discover the District in Luxury"" inauguration experience at D. C.'s Ritz-Carlton. That would have included, among other things, two round-trip, first-class plane tickets to Washington and a 3-carat sapphire necklace set. Yet over at The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City — 3 miles away — there is a one-bedroom executive suite available for two nights during inauguration weekend for $999 a night.
If those packages or room rates are too pricey for your pocketbook, there are less-costly alternatives still available (note that prices may vary, and fluctuate depending on the day).
As of last week, inauguration weekend rates at hotels.com returned rates such as $265 at The Fairfax at Embassy Row near Dupont Circle, $299 at the AKA White House (two blocks from White House) and $256 at the Omni Shoreham in Woodley Park.
For alt-hotel options, WhyHotel, which operates pop-up hotels in new apartment buildings, is taking reservations for The Bartlett in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington. As of last week, rates were $779 a night for a three-night stay in a two-bedroom unit.
Home-rental sites and Craigslist are still showing plenty of inauguration inventory, although some of the offers may seem a little off the wall.
On Craigslist there was a listing for a two-bedroom basement apartment in a single-family home ($1,195 for the three-day inauguration weekend), but guests are advised to bring their own air mattresses, because there is no furniture.
And in what's advertised as ""The Worst Deal on Airbnb"" a host in Alexandria is offering a one-bedroom apartment for $1,000 a night. According to the listing, what you're renting is actually ""a couch in the living room. But is a sectional so two people can definitely fit on it.""
For those who plan to dally in D. C. through the inauguration weekend, there are plenty of low-cost and free things to do.
All the Smithsonian museums, except the National Museum of the American Indian and the Renwick Gallery, plan to welcome visitors during normal hours on Inauguration Day.
A photo portrait of President-elect Trump will be on display at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery through the inauguration festivities and the National Museum of American History will offer a live broadcast of the swearing-in ceremony and the president's speech.
The George Washington University Museum (suggested admission donation: $8), in Washington's Foggy Bottom neighborhood, has an exhibition on view through April 10 featuring flag-inspired memorabilia and a wide variety of advertising items from past presidential campaigns.
And on January 21 and 22, when hundreds of thousands of women plan to travel to D. C. for the Women's March on Washington, the National Museum of Women in the Arts will be waiving its usual admission charge and offering special programming.",0
"Novartis AG, set to beat Kite Pharma Inc. to the finish line in one of the most promising new areas of cancer research, is examining how to price a revolutionary therapy patients will need to take just once.
The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is likely to rule in early October on the experimental treatment called CTL019, Vas Narasimhan, global head of drug development and chief medical officer at Novartis, said in an interview.The regulator is due to decide on Kite’s product, designedfor a different type of blood cancer, by Nov. 29.
The two therapies are vying to become the first blockbusters in an emerging field known as CAR-T, in which a patient’s immune cells are extracted and genetically modified to hunt and kill cancer before being returned to the body. Novartis may link the price of its treatment to results in each patient, according to Narasimhan. It’s also using stem cell transplants -- which cost as much as $800,000 apiece -- as a yardstick.
“We’re looking at multiple creative options,”Narasimhan said.“We’re still in the forming stages of figuring out what the right approach is going to be.”
The treatments probably can’t be priced much higher than stem cell transplants,according to David Nierengarten, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. Kite and Novartis probably have similar price tags in mind, yet whoever is first may be able to able to lock down beds in medical centers that will do the CAR-T procedures, or work out advantageous reimbursement structures, he said.
CAR-T drugs could be “priced at a level where we collect something for the risk that we took, but also give back a tremendous amount of value,” Novartis Chief Executive Officer Joe Jimenez told investors in Boston on May 31. “This could be a potential new platform that is a very large and profitable business.”
Jimenez cited studies carried out for U. K. health authorities thatshow the treatments may be cost-effective at about 583,000 pounds ($750,000). Such a hypothetical price is in the “right ballpark,” yet it’s unlikely to be acceptable as a one-time payment,according to Stephen Palmer, a professor at the University of York who helped compile the report.
The Novartis medicine awaits clearance for a severe form of cancer in children and young adults known asacute lymphoblastic leukemia, while Kite’s first target is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,which afflicts a larger group of people.
The Swiss drugmaker is turning next to that same form of blood cancer. A mid-stage studyreleased Wednesday evaluating the therapy in DLBCL found that more than a thirdof patients had the disease wiped out. It also didn’t return in those people, the company said. Side effects included nervous-system symptoms and low white-blood cell count that were ranked as severe or life threatening.
Another concern about CAR-T therapies has revolved around manufacturing capabilities for such personalized medicines. Novartis said it’s confident it will be able to meet the demands in producing the cancer treatments, addressing concernsraised by the number of dropouts in the latest trial results.
There’s a need for new pricing approaches for medicines that bring uncertainty as well as huge potential benefits, the U. K.’s health-cost adviser found in a study last year. One idea is akin to leasing, with the price spread over monthly fees.
CAR-Ts could command a high price because they’re intended as one-time treatments and have shown benefits in some patients who had no other options. Yet some studies indicate that only about one in three people experience a lasting response. Some sort of pay-for-performance deal may entice insurers to accept higher price tags, because it means they’ll get paid back if the treatment fails.
Kite may charge $325,000 per treatment,the analyst Nierengarten wrote in a March note. To justify the company’s market value -- currently about $4.6 billion -- it would need to charge $500,000 per course or capture as much as 50 percent of the market, a scenario that’s possible but unlikely, he said.
The main goal at first,according to Novartis’s Narasimhan, is ensuring that children who are months away from dying get access to the therapy.",0
"A partial skull unearthed in the Manot Cave in Israel’s West Galilee has given paleontologists the first key evidence that modern humans co-inhabited the area with Neanderthals with whom they possibly interbred up to 55,000 years ago.
Tel Aviv University anthropologist Israel Hershkovitz led the study published in the US journal Nature, hailed the ancient skull as “an important piece of the puzzle of the big story of human evolution.”
The partial cranium, covered in a patina of minerals produced by the wet conditions within the cave, has allowed researchers from the Geological Survey of Israel to determine that the skull was between 50,000 to 60,000 years old.
“It is the first direct fossil evidence that modern humans and Neanderthals inhabited the same area at the same time,” said paleontologist Bruce Latimer of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, who took part in the research.
According to Latimer, the skull consisted of a rather small brain of around 1,100 milliliters, while the modern human brain averages around 1,400 milliliters. The fossil’s gender is nonetheless unclear because it’s missing the brow ridge, one marker for gender differences. Because the skull is from an adult, researchers said it wasn’t related to other sub-adult human teeth and bones also found in the cave.
“This leads us to believe that there are likely more fossils in the cave where other bones associated with the skull might be found,” Mark Hans, chair of Cleveland’s Case Western Reserve University’s Department of Orthodontics said.
According to scientists, our species first appeared in Africa, about 200,000 years ago, and later migrated elsewhere. Neanderthals, meanwhile, prospered across Europe and Asia from about 350,000 to 40,000 years ago, going extinct after the arrival of Homo sapiens. It has been previously suspected that modern humans and Neanderthals were somewhere “in the same place at the same time,” but scientists lacked the physical evidence. The latest discovery challenges a previous premise that the two species could have come together somewhere in Europe, about 45,000 years ago.
“Modern humans and Neanderthals likely encountered each other foraging for food,” Latimer said.
The prehistoric Manot cave is located in the region where Neanderthals periodically lived, along the only land route for ancient humans to take from Africa into the Middle East, Asia and Europe.
The fossil skull was discovered by accident by caver who in 2008 had rappelled through a newly opened roof of the previously unknown cave that had been sealed for 30,000 years. Hunting tools and animal bones have been excavated from the cave, along with human remains.",1
