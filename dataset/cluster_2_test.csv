In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) we look at each food as not only having nutritional values but also having individual properties that act in a very specific way on the body.
By using specific foods, tailored to the individual and their particular set of symptoms (we’d identify it as a particular pattern or imbalance in the body), one can help to rebalance the body and heal in a very specific and customized way.
No two people are the same, and therefore it is important to listen to your particular body and symptoms and pick foods that work for you.
As we enter into these colder winter months, it is important to switch our diets from the more fresh, cooling foods of summer (think fresh cooling cucumbers, salad greens, tomatoes and watermelon) to the deeper warming, nourishing and building foods of winter (think warming spices like cinnamon, cumin, ginger and all the hearty soups and warm drinks that winter brings).
Ginger: A Wonderful Warming Spice
One of the most wonderful warming spices we use in Chinese Medicine is ginger. Ginger has the amazing ability to warm the body in a very deep way. In addition to just balancing out the cold that comes in this winter season, this spice is particularly good for someone who suffers from cold symptoms.
A cold pattern in TCM would show up in someone who is, go figure, cold all the time (the one who is in a sweater when everyone else is in a t-shirt). They can have aches and pains that feel worse in cold weather including sore lower back and knees; they may have very frequent and pale urination often having to wake through the night to go pee.
They may also suffer from looser bowels, tend towards edema or swellings and retaining water as well as having a constant running or drippy nose (particularly when outside) and may suffer from very low energy. This person would do very well drinking dried ginger tea or adding dried ginger to their meals.
Another healing benefit of ginger is for those suffering from what we’d call a cold wind pattern. What this means is those suffering from a common cold that exhibits more cold signs than hot ones: chills but no fever, running nose that is clear watery mucus with lots of sneezing.
(If you’re suffering from a sore throat, thick yellow mucus or fever – ginger is not the spice for you. You’ll need a cooling spice like peppermint to clear the heat).
Consuming Ginger
The best way to consume ginger for this pattern is in its fresh/raw form. Fresh grated or sliced ginger in hot water with a bit of lemon and raw honey can do wonders for the onset of a cold.
I’ve listed an excellent little soup below that’s easy to make and works wonders at the onset of a wind-cold invasion (aka the common cold!)
I always keep some nourishing stock in the freezer and try to be sure to have green onions, astragalus, fresh ginger and garlic on hand throughout the winter. If I’m feeling a bit rundown and noticing the onset of a cold coming on, I can whip this up and nip it in the bud before it progresses to a full blown cold. It works like a charm!
Wishing you a cozy, healthy and nourishing winter season!
Ginger Soup To Kick That Cold To The Curb
I’ve got chills…and they’re multiplying (Common cold with chills and clear runny nose. No fever). Boost your qi, build your blood and kick that cold to the curb broth.
Ingredients
1-2 inch piece of Fresh Ginger sliced thinly.
4 Green onions sliced into medium sized pieces.
1-2 garlic cloves peeled and chopped (you can also use a garlic press).
6 cups Chicken bone broth  (see below) -You can also use regular chicken stock for this recipe if you don’t have the time or broth ready.
And for vegetarians, see below for another option.
Directions
Place ginger, onions, garlic and mushrooms (if you choose) in a pot and add a small amount of broth.
Simmer until ingredients are softened.
Add the rest of the stock and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 20-30minutes. Sip on broth throughout the day and feel better!
This broth/soup can be stored in the fridge easily for a few days. You can also eat the ginger pieces if you like for some extra heat.
Feel free to add some other vegetables if you desire to make it more of a meal. But be careful not to add too much salt as salt tends to bring things deeper into the body and this is more about pushing out the cold virus.
Options:
Add in dried or fresh mushrooms (shitake, maitake, etc.) to add an extra boost for your qi.
Add in 4-5 pieces of Astragalus (Huang Qi) to the broth as it is simmering to boost your immune system and energy (qi).
A Note On The Stock
Bone broth is incredibly easy to make and just takes a bit of time, but not a lot of energy. If you have a slow cooker that’s great or I would just let my broth simmer on the lowest setting possible on my stove overnight to get the same effect.
Organic Chicken Bone Broth
Organic chicken bones simmered for 24 hrs with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.
For one pound of bones, you need about 12- cups of water or just fill the pot to cover the bones instead of measuring it out.
Once it has simmered for 24 hours, skimming off the fat and oil on the surface, strain, and store in glass jars or freeze for later use.
I usually have stock simmering in my slow cooker every week to use with cooking or just freeze, so I have it to use in a pinch. Saving your bones from a roast or just checking with your local butcher for chicken backs or ends is a great way to get the bones for the broth).
You can also save the ends of your vegetables in a bag in the freezer and add them to the stock for a bit more of a nutritional boost!
Broth for Vegetarians
Vegetarians you can make a vegan “bone broth” using vegetable stock or the ends of your veggies simmered for 8-10 hours and adding things like seaweeds, mushrooms, and miso to up the nutrient content.
The Medicine in Your Cup  Ginger
This is a naturally warming food and has a pungent taste. Fresh ginger is particularly good at treating the common cold when presenting with chills (but NOT fever!). It also has the added benefit or warming and soothing the digestive system helping with nausea, upset stomach, and appetite
Garlic
This is shown to have the lovely perk (in addition to tasting great) of being antibacterial and immune boosting. It is considered warm in Traditional Chinese Medicine food therapy and is great for reducing swellings, removing toxicity and carcinogens, strengthening the digestive system and moving our qi!
Green Onion/Scallion
This is also considered a warm and pungent herb, which makes it great for getting rid of ‘superficial’ conditions (aka the common cold) that are cold in nature (those chills!). It can be eaten cooked or raw and adds a great flavor to foods and works well in combination with ginger for that warming action.
Astragalus Root
This powerful herbal tool is easily found at your local Chinese market or herbal store. It has sweet and slightly warm properties and has great immune boosting properties. We say it works on the Lung and digestive systems in TCM and has great Qi (energy) boosting properties to it. It’s great for someone who seems to get sick all the time or has a lingering cough or just can’t seem to beat their cold.

Apple iPhone X reviews hit the web early Tuesday morning, with most of the reviews focused on the upgrades to the iPhone's internals, including its camera.
By and large, the reviews were extraordinarily positive on Apple's latest iPhone, but there were a few hiccups with the device, most notably Face ID, Apple's facial recognition technology. In many cases, the reviewers found that it didn't always work as expected and there were some hiccups.
In September, when Apple announced the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and the X, it said the chances of a random person unlocking your phone via Face ID were 1 in 1 million, compared to 1 in 50,000 for TouchID.
APPLE IPHONE 8 REVIEW ROUNDUP: WHAT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BUY
The iPhone X (prounded ""ten"") has wireless charging, using the Qi wireless charging standard, a complete redesign, Animoji (animated emoji) and several other new features. The device, which goes on sale officially Nov. 3, starts at $999 for the 64GB model and $1,149 for the 256GB model.
Here are five of the top reviews on Apple's iPhone X.
In his review, TechCruch editor-in-chief Matt Panzarino took the phone to Disneyland for testing to see how it would fare in the real world use and it worked great.
Panzarino also found Face ID to be incredibly helpful and easy to use, writing, it works ""really well"" and ""it worked the vast majority of times I tried it, it never once unlocked using a picture of myself or another person’s face and the failure rate seemed to be about the same as Touch ID — aka almost never.""
In his review, The Verge's editor-in-chief Nilay Patel noted that the display, which uses an OLED screen instead of the LCD screen Apple had used previously, is ""excellent.""
Though he had some problems with Face ID, Patel still said the iPhone X ""is clearly the best iPhone ever made.""
""If you’re one of the many people who preordered this thing, I think you’ll be happy, although you’ll be going on the journey of figuring out when and how FaceID works best with everyone else,"" he added.
Steven Levy, one of the first reviewers of the original iPhone, reviewed the new iPhone X for Wired and was impressed by both the screen and the battery life, something Apple has worked hard to extend.
""I am an avid fan of increased battery life and thus appreciate the iPhone X’s alleged two extra hours of power between charges (compared to an iPhone 7),"" Levy wrote. ""I had no time to assess this scientifically, but can verify that my unit powered through the usual late-afternoon low-battery doldrums and still seemed to have some juice when it came time for nighttime charging.""
WILL YOU BE ABLE TO GET AN IPHONE X AT LAUNCH?
Endgadget's senior editor Chris Velazco was generally impressed by the device, even if there were a few issues, like dealing with slowness in apps.
""Tim Cook has made clear that the X is the future of Apple's smartphones, but the future doesn't feel foreign at all -- it feels surprisingly natural, surprisingly quickly,"" Velazco wrote.
Tom's Guide's editor-in-chief Mark Spoonauer reviewed the iPhone X and was incredibly positive on the device, saying its cameras live up to the competition and it feels more natural to hold in your hand, despite the larger screen size.
""You get a fairly large 5.8-inch screen in a phone that’s easy to use with one hand,"" Spoonauer wrote. ""Not only did I have no problem stretching my thumb across the display, the iPhone X is also a lot easier to slip into my front jeans pocket than the iPhone 8 Plus.""

"MILAN — Over the weekend — as attention turned to the Oscars, speculation grew as to just how political the awards ceremony would get, and various members of the fashion flock peeled away from the crowd and flew off to Los Angeles to help with that spectacle — a spectacle of another sort took place in Milan.
The “pussy hat” arrived on the runway.
The Missoni runway, that is. As guests arrived, they discovered hundreds of pink Missoni knit hats with quasi-pointed ears laid out on the long benches that formed the seating. And at the end of the show — after a parade of knits of many colors and patterns, often layered three at a time, as if to demonstrate that different stripes (and squares and diamonds) can mesh surprisingly, if eye-bogglingly, well — the designer Angela Missoni and the rest of the extended Missoni clan, including her mother, Rosita, crowded onto the runway in their hats and urged everyone, along with all their models, to join them to “show the world the fashion community is united and fearless.” In the background, “Power to the People” played.
Turns out Hollywood and la mode share more than just a mutually advantageous clothes connection. They both have a yen to use their platforms for a certain amount of proselytizing as well. The trend (because that is beginning to be what it feels like, for good or ill, especially when fashion gets involved) may have begun in New York with the slogan T-shirt, but it has been picking up steam in Italy.

"Baking soda is a common ingredient, which can be found in almost every kitchen. It is too versatile, so that it can be used for cooking, cleaning, etc. Moreover, baking soda also has various health benefits and therapeutic effects. Namely, it has an ability to stop hair loss and stimulate hair growth!
In addition, baking soda acts as a natural shampoo because it can cleanse the hair. Also, it serves as a conditioner since it can soften the hair. As you can see, this ingredient has incredible benefits for your hair. So, why not use it instead of your regular shampoo?
– Stimulates Hair Growth
In fact, baking soda can clean your hair completely naturally. Furthermore, it can also make it soft and healthy. As mentioned previously, it can prevent and stop hair loss as well as support hair growth.
– Boosts Hair Growth
If your hair is loaded with toxins and chemicals, it will suppress hair growth. However, baking soda will clean your hair more effectively than any shampoo.
That’s not all, it will also help you eliminate the extra dirt from your hair, thus allowing it to grow long and strong.
– Gets Rid of the Chlorine
Chlorine can result in significant hair damage. What’s more, it can also change your hair color. On the contrary, baking soda can eliminate the chlorine from your hair and scalp, thus preventing any hair damage.
– Eliminates Any Hair Product Residue
This ingredient can also eliminate any leftovers from your regular hair products. Did you know that any conditioner, shampoo, or hair spray residue can weight down your hair, thus making it greasy? On the other hand, baking soda can cleanse you hair naturally. It is a beneficial ingredient that greatly improves the quality of your hair and removes any residue of conditioners or shampoo, which provides a long-lasting shine of the hair.
DIY Baking Soda Shampoo Recipe
All you need to do is combine water and baking soda in ratio 3-1.
Keep in mind that the longer the hair, the more shampoo you need to prepare.
Specifically, it is advisable to mix 6 tablespoons of water with 1 tablespoon of baking soda, if you have a shoulder-length hair. Additionally, you can also use this homemade baking soda shampoo on dry hair.
You should start rubbing the resulted mixture from your hair roots to the ends. Next, leave it to act for several minutes. Then, use warm water to wash it off.
At least, it is recommended to rinse the hair as usual by using a mixture of apple cider vinegar and water in ratio 4-1. Also, you can add several drops of essential oil. Make sure the mixture does not come in contact with your eyes.
You will be amazed by the results since baking soda will stop hair loss, support hair growth and revitalize your hair.

Stir in the minced jalapeo and garlic, then add 2 tablespoons of the chili powder, half the cumin, the smoked paprika, the tomatoes and their juices, tomato paste and water, stirring to incorporate. Increase the heat to medium-high; once the liquid begins to boil, stir in the lentils.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, so the mixture is barely bubbling; cook for 15 minutes or until the lentils are mostly tender (they will look plumped). Add more water, as needed. Add the kidney beans, black beans, the remaining  teaspoon each of the salt and pepper, the remaining tablespoon each of cumin and chili powder, stirring to incorporate. Once the beans have heated through, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 20 minutes, stirring a few times. Taste and add salt and/or pepper, as needed.   VARIATION: To make this in a slow cooker, add all the ingredients at once and cook on HIGH for 3 hours.     For stories, features such as Date Lab, Gene Weingarten and more, visit WP Magazine.

"How are you? I hope you are well! My name is Jared Kushner, and I would like to go to you. As an example of how smart I am, here is some money.
I heard from my daddy and my friends’ daddies that you are a big house for smart, good boys. I am a good boy! I am nice and my face is very smooth. Would you like a hundred-dollar bill? It has Benjamin Franklin on it! He is silly, because he only has hair on the sides, not on the top. Here are some of him!
Here are some facts about me: I am Jared. I am more than six feet tall, which is funny, because feet are on your legs, not how tall you are! That always makes me laugh. My favorite color is green, like money. My favorite shape is rectangle, like money. I also like round, which is like some kinds of money that poor people use for littering in fountains.
When I was a kid, which was last year, I got mad that there was no sixty-nine-dollar bill, so my daddy paid the U. S. Treasury to make one special for me. I showed it to all my friends and we all laughed and then I gave it to our maid because I was bored with it. She cleaned it and gave it back to me so that I could throw it away.
I am a good student. I got straight D’s in high school. “D” is the first letter in the alphabet. At first, the teachers said “A” was the first letter, but my daddy paid the teachers to teach us a new alphabet song so that I wouldn’t feel bad about my grades. It worked! In school, my favorite classes were recess and lunch. I did very good on the SAT because I filled in every single bubble, even the ones for my name, which was a trick question. I am so smart! For me, tests are as easy as D-B-C!
I am good at after-school activities, such as sports and allowance. I was on the basketball team in high school. My daddy gave the referee money so that I didn’t have to dribble and could just carry the ball. All the other good boys were jealous, but only my daddy loved me enough to pay the referees so that I got to carry the ball and use a ladder. Ladder dunks are worth fifty points.
My daddy is also so good at games. Daddy and I like to play a game called hide-and-go-seek, which is where we tape money to ourselves and go to the Cayman Islands and hide the money all around. We are so good that no one ever finds it! Daddy said we were there to put the money in the laundry, which is funny because after we buried the money it was so much dirtier and sandier than before. My daddy is so silly sometimes!
Harvard, I would like to go to you so that I can be big and strong someday, like all my daddy’s friends. They are so cool and impressive. They wear ties all the time to keep their shirts from falling off. My daddy is so rich that he can buy any building he wants, even the Empire State Building or the moon. Here are some things I want to be when I grow up: a fireman, an astronaut, a business boy, a fire truck, a thousand-dollar bill. If you would like some more money, here is some more money!
I do not want to be mean, but if you do not let me into you something bad might happen. My daddy is very nice but when he is mad he can be very scary. One time when he got mad he made a lady go to my uncle’s house to kiss my uncle even though the lady wasn’t my aunt! Yuck!
Anyway, thank you for letting me into Harvard! I am so excited to go in you. When I arrive, I would like four dorm rooms, a parking space for my Range Rover, a girlfriend, a girlfriend for my Range Rover, a pony, a Range Rover for my pony, three opals, and the ocean. I have been a good boy and I deserve it!",0
"Many consider vision themost precious sense, yet eye health often is neglected. The digital and dynamic world in which we live, we often shorten from sleep, and we get our eyes even more tired and exhausted with the continuous staring at computers, television screens, mobile phones… We forget that eye examinations are not only required to obtain a driver’s license but that should be done regularly for timely detection of any disease and vision problems.
Your computer can operate for 24 hours without interruption, but not you. You are not a machine. Every 20 minutes staring at the screen, do 20 seconds pause, looking at an object that is 5 meters away from you. This will give them the needed break and this way you avoid fatigue.
Most people flee from eye exams with various excuses such as “I used to have problems with eyesight, but now everything is fine” or “I see fine, I do not need an eye examination.” The truth is that the vision is not only on your ability to read, to watch the road, traffic signs and the nature around you. You may have an eye problem even without being aware of it. So the next time not run away from examinations at your ophthalmologist, but look for his expert opinion.
When the hands come in contact with unclean object, they become carriers of bacteria, and in contact with the eye can easily cause infection. Risk group are users of contact lenses due to frequent contact of hands with eyes. If you belong into this group, you have exceptional importance of washing hands before putting and removing the lenses.
It’s easy to take your favorite series or to lose yourself in interesting content on the Internet, so
you stay wide-eyed while. Remind yourself that you have to blink to protect your eyes. Blinking washes eyes with natural tears and prevents drying.
The eye shadows and other make up products do not last forever. Although eye shadow look nice, after 2-3 years of usage it is not reasonable to use them. Mascara is even more problematic and is not recommended to use it more than six months after opening. If you notice a change in the smell and texture of the make up immediately get rid of them. Through timely changing the makeup you reduce the risk of infections. And another warning: Never use someone else’s eye makeup and do not share yours, whether it comes from your sister, cousin or best friend.
Ask the closer members of your family if someone has ever been diagnosed with an eye disease. It is important to know the history of diseases in your family, because some of them are inherited. This information will show you whether the risk of eye disease is increased or not.
Being overweight increases the risk of developing certain conditions like diabetes. One of the negative consequences of diabetes is the appearance of complications with vision.
Maybe you’re reading a book while you feel headache and exhaustion. The most common reason is eye fatigue caused by under-lit room or by improper distance between your eyes and the book. When you read, the book should be away from the eyes about 15 cm. The closer it is, the harder it is for the eyes to focus on the inscribed lines. Read in a well lit room, but do not have the source of light directed straight to your face.
The strong rubbing of the eye while it contains a foreign body may cause its irritation or damage to the delicate retina. First, check your eye to see if you notice problematic body to remove it. If you fail to see, close your eye and gently blink. Let the tears do their job and help them “wash away” the eye. If you feel the urge to scratch the eye little bit stronger, do not blink hard, because you can do more damage. In this case, it is best to wash the eye with water.
If the risk of cancer of the tongue, lung cancer, yellowing fingers and many other consequences of smoking you motivated enough to quit, there is an additional reason. The smoking adversely affects the sight that increases the risk of cataracts, macular degeneration and damage the optic nerve. Well, why do not you leave this harmful habit immediately and escape from the clutches of vice called smoking?

“Steps are being taken towards legalisation and decriminalisation of marijuana in the United States, and rates of recreational marijuana use may increase substantially as a result,” said lead author Barbara A Yankey, a PhD student in the School of Public Health, Georgia State University, Atlanta, US. “However, there is little research on the impact of marijuana use on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality.”
In the absence of longitudinal data on marijuana use, the researchers designed a retrospective follow-up study of NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) participants aged 20 years and above. In 2005–2006, participants were asked if they had ever used marijuana. Those who answered “yes” were considered marijuana users. Participants reported the age when they first tried marijuana and this was subtracted from their current age to calculate the duration of use.
Information on marijuana use was merged with mortality data in 2011 from the National Centre for Health Statistics. The researchers estimated the associations of marijuana use, and duration of use, with death from hypertension, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease, controlling for cigarette use and demographic variables including sex, age, and ethnicity. Death from hypertension included multiple causes such as primary hypertension and hypertensive renal disease.
Among a total of 1 213 participants, 34% used neither marijuana nor cigarettes, 21% used only marijuana, 20% used marijuana and smoked cigarettes, 16% used marijuana and were past-smokers, 5% were past-smokers and 4% only smoked cigarettes. The average duration of marijuana use was 11.5 years.
Marijuana users had a higher risk of dying from hypertension. Compared to non-users, marijuana users had a 3.42-times higher risk of death from hypertension and a 1.04 greater risk for each year of use. There was no association between marijuana use and death from heart disease or cerebrovascular disease.
Ms Yankey said: “We found that marijuana users had a greater than three-fold risk of death from hypertension and the risk increased with each additional year of use.”
Ms Yankey pointed out that there were limitations to the way marijuana use was estimated. For example, it cannot be certain that participants used marijuana continuously since they first tried it.
She said: “Our results suggest a possible risk of hypertension mortality from marijuana use. This is not surprising since marijuana is known to have a number of effects on the cardiovascular system. Marijuana stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increases in heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen demand. Emergency rooms have reported cases of angina and heart attacks after marijuana use.”
The authors stated that the cardiovascular risk associated with marijuana use may be greater than the cardiovascular risk already established for cigarette smoking.
“We found higher estimated cardiovascular risks associated with marijuana use than cigarette smoking,” said Ms Yankey. “This indicates that marijuana use may carry even heavier consequences on the cardiovascular system than that already established for cigarette smoking. However, the number of smokers in our study was small and this needs to be examined in a larger study.”
“Needless to say, the detrimental effects of marijuana on brain function far exceed that of cigarette smoking,” she added.
Ms Yankey said it was crucial to understand the effects of marijuana on health so that policy makers and individuals could make informed decisions.
She said: “Support for liberal marijuana use is partly due to claims that it is beneficial and possibly not harmful to health. With the impending increase in recreational marijuana use it is important to establish whether any health benefits outweigh the potential health, social and economic risks. If marijuana use is implicated in cardiovascular diseases and deaths, then it rests on the health community and policy makers to protect the public.”Contacts and sources:

Watch: Rand Paul savagely takes down new Republican budget that adds trillions in debt
Kentucky Senator Rand Paul has been very clear about his inabilityto vote for a Republican budget that won’t balance out our out of control spending. Just last month, he stated that he would outright refuse to vote for the upcoming budget that ads nearly $10 trillion to our debt, and at a $1 million a minute, it’s very understandable that the libertarian leaning Republican would put his foot down on the brake as hard as possible.
And to reaffirm this, Paul took to the floor on Wednesday and absolutely demolished the budget that Republicans are calling the “vehicle to repeal Obamacare.” While the name makes it sound like something Republicans would be foolish not to vote on, Paul isn’t having it, and let his colleagues know it in a 20 minute speech.
“The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same,” began Paul. “Republicans won the White House. Republicans control the Senate. Republicans control the House. And what will the first order of business be for the new Republican majority? To pass a budget that never balances. To pass a budget that will add $9.7 trillion of new debt over ten years.”
“Is that really what we campaigned on?” asked Paul. “Is that really what the Republican party represents? Our first order of business will be a budget that never balances!”
“Is it all smoke and mirrors?” continued Paul. “Is there really a difference? Are Republicans different from Democrats? It’s a pretty important question.”
After comparing this increase in debt to former Democratic plans that brought us further into nation destroying debt, Paul offered a solution that would actually bring it under control for the first time in years.
“As this moves forward, I will offer a replacement,” said Paul. “I will offer my own budget. I will offer to strike and remove $10 trillion worth of debt, and I will offer my own budget that balances within five years.”
Paul goes on to explain his plan involves freezing spending, and should other parts of government need increased spending, then they should take them from others. In fact, Paul offers that certain government departments that you could eliminate and you’d never know they were gone, such as the Department of Commerce.
“I remember a time when it was the moderates who were for freezing spending, and the real conservatives were cutting spending,” said Paul. “Now nobody’s for cutting spending!”
Paul alsoonce again aimed his proverbial guns at entitlements. Having before said that if one isnot willing to take on our dangerously large entitlement spending, “I just don’t think you’re a fiscal conservative.”
“It is inexcusable that we’re not talking about how we fix Medicare,” said Paul. “It is inexcusable that we’re not talking about how we fix social security! If you don’t fix them, there’s going to be a cliff. Within about a decade, the cliff is so severe that everyone on social security will suffer a 20 percent decline in their monthly check.”
Paul goes on with blistering commentary about Republicans going along with building debt, and once again making it clear that he will not participate in this $9.7 trillion addition to it.

This article will discuss the findings of numerous studies which have pointed out that this oil is extremely beneficial in preventing and treating different cancer types.
However, conventional medicine still hasn’t approved it as a useful treatment. There are a few issues linked to this problem, as some political pressures which postpone clinical research with human cancer patients, and drug companies which would normally not benefit from this oil, and would rather suppress its use.
Black Seeds have been used to Treat Cancer for Thousands of Years
Two separate studies conducted in 2011 by Chinese and Saudi Arabian researchers, examined the scientific literature concerning the use of this oil and its benefits in the case of cancer and found that it is a completely safe and effective cancer treatment.
Moreover, they showed that black seed oil has been used for centuries, and it, as well as its extracted ingredient, thymoquinone, provides incredible effects in the case of numerous health conditions, like diabetes, kidney disease, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular complications, etc.
Furthermore, this remarkable oil is a powerful agent in fighting skin, cervix, prostate, breast, lung, kidney, liver cancer, as well as in cancer in the blood system.
According to these researchers, the molecular mechanisms responsible for its anti-cancer role are still not clear enough. Yet, thymoquinone was found to act as an antioxidant and to boost the defense system of the body.
Black seed oil causes apoptosis, so it promotes a systematic elimination of cells which are no longer needed, are old, or unhealthy ( as cancer cells), and does not release toxins into the body. Moreover, this beneficial oil is also responsible for the control of the Akt pathway, that it, the process that helps the survival of normal and cancer cells.
The strong cancer- fighting properties of this oil have been used and recognized for ages, yet, this traditional health miracle has become a subject of research of modern science in the last 2 or 3 decades.
A research conducted in Egypt examined the beneficial effects of the combination of bee honey and Nigella grains on the oxidative stress and the created cancer.
The research was conducted on rats that were subjected to a strong carcinogen. Rats were divided into four groups and exposed to the same carcinogen, but some of them were given black seeds or honey, and one of the groups was given a combination of honey and black seeds. Rats were examined for a period of 6 months.
At the end, the findings showed that rats that consumed black seeds were 80% protected against oxidative stress and cancer formation while those that were given a daily dose of the combination of black seeds and honey enjoyed a full, 100% protection against oxidative stress, cancer formation, and inflammatory responses.
Black Seed Oil Helps In The Case Of Radiation Treatments
A study conducted in Turkey in 2014 demonstrated that black seed oil may help individuals while receiving radiation treatment for cancer. In this case, patients experience numerous severe side effects due to the radiation.
Therefore, researchers tried to evaluate the effects of irradiation and the addition of this oil on the oxidant/antioxidant system in the liver tissue of irradiated rats. Some rats were exposed to a single dose of gamma radiation.
The control group was not irradiated. Moreover, one group was given one gram of black seed oil per kilogram of body weight an hour before the radiation treatment and a daily dose afterward for a period of 10 days.
Another group of rats received the radiation treatment and afterward received a saline solution instead of black seed oil. Findings pointed out that black seed oil has strong antioxidant properties, which also increases the antioxidant capacity in the rats’ liver tissue, and also lowers oxidative stress markers.
Hence, researchers proved that the use of this miraculous oil before or 10 days after a radiation treatment prevented the detrimental effect of radiation.
Scientists in India conducted another study in 2012 and examined the effect of the black seeds on mice exposed to gamma radiation. They tested two groups of mice: one normal group and one consisting of tumor-bearing mice.
The aim was to mimic the human clinical setting where normal tissues of cancer patients are subjected to the detrimental effects of the therapy with radiation.
Before gamma radiation, mice received 100 mg of black seed extract per 1 kg of body weight. Findings demonstrated that the extract of black seed provides prevents liver, spleen, brain and intestine damage due to gamma radiation in the case of normal and mice with tumors.
Hence, it was concluded that this extract prevents the destroying effects of radiation, and protects against biochemical alterations. This property was found to be due to its powerful antioxidant properties and its ability to scavenge free radicals.
Therefore, it can play a major role in human cancer patients who receive radiation in order to protect against oxidative stress in normal tissues, and to reduce other side effects of the radiation therapy. This would significantly improve the quality of their lives.
The use of thymoquinone, a compound derived from black seeds, was examined in a study in 2013 in India. Researchers studied 2 groups of rats with liver cancer, and one group received water that had 0.01% thymoquinone, and the other group consumed plain water.
Then, the tumor markers, liver cancer nodules, and liver injury markers were evaluated in both groups after 4 months. Those rats that did consume the thymoquinone had a significant rise in the size of the liver tumor.
On the other hand, the other rats that had 20 mg of thymoquinone per kilogram for body weight had significantly lowered liver injury markers and reduced tumor markers. Moreover, these rats did not develop liver cancer nodules, and the amount of new tumor formation was much less when compared to rats from the other group.
This led to the conclusion that thymoquinone acts beneficially in the liver cancer treatment since it successfully inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells.
Another Egyptian study from 2012 examined the cancer- fighting effects of bee honey and black seed oil on human liver cancer cells in laboratory experiments.
They evaluated the antioxidant power of honey and black seed extract, and their ability to combat unhealthy cells. Eventually, it was found that both of these were incredibly effective in reducing the liver cancer cells growth. Moreover, they caused a death of cancer cells by apoptosis and enhanced the antioxidant status of cells.
In 2014, Saudi Arabian scientists stated that traditional medicine has used black seeds to treat many diseases. The anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant properties of black seed oil were popular and commonly used.
They evaluated the cancer- fighting activity of black seed oil and black seed extract in human lung cancer cells in laboratory conditions. Lung cancer cells were subjected to black seed oil or to black seed extract for 24 hours. Scientists used 0.01 mg/ml to 1 mg/ml of the extract or the oil or the extract. Afterward, the growth of cancer cells was evaluated.
Scientists found that the exposure to black seed oil or black seed extract greatly lowered the population of living cancer cells and changed the morphology of cells.
Namely, it was discovered that the greater the concentration of the extract or the oil used in the treatment, the greater the level of cell death. Furthermore, both of these stimulated the loss of the typical appearance of cancer cells, and they became smaller.
This data proved that black seed extract and black seed oil greatly impede the development of human lung cancer cells.
A study conducted at the Ohio State University in 2013 found that glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive kind of malignant brain tumor in people, with a median survival of 15 months.
Therefore, researchers stated that there is a significant need for extra therapies of glioblastoma. Scientists have suggested the use of natural phytochemicals as they have powerful anti- cancer properties.
One of the bioactive compounds of black seed oil, Thymoquinone, has strong anti- cancer, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as selective cytotoxic properties for human cells. This means that it fights human cancer cells, but does not affect te healthy cells in the body.
Moreover, thymoquinone selectively impedes the ability of glioblastoma cancer cells of the brain and spinal cord to create their clones. Yet, it does not impede normal cell activity in the human brain and spinal cord.
Also, it effectively inhibits autophagy genes in cancer cells. Autophagy in cancer cells maintains the production of cellular energy, a and thus promotes the growth of tumor cells.
Logically, if autophagy is prevented, then the production of cellular energy for cancer cells will also be damaged. The result of this will be a regression of tumor activity, so the cancer- affected organs will survive. Hence, thymoquinone can be extremely beneficial in cancer therapies as it has powerful ability to prevent cancer cells cloning, and to inhibit autophagy.
Another study conducted in Malaysia in 2013 studied the cancer- fighting ability of thymoquinone in a long-term treatment of human breast cancer cell lines in the laboratory.
They discovered a sustained ability to prevent breast cancer cell proliferation with long-term treatment. The length of inhibition was determined by the size of the thymoquinone dose influenced the length of this inhibition, meaning that the larger the dose was, the bigger was the inhibition produced.
A 2013 Malaysian study reported a growing interest in the use of naturally occurring compounds from traditional anti-cancer medicines. Nigella sativa (black seed) is one of the most commonly examined plants, due to the cancer- fighting abilities of thymoquinone, through the process of apoptosis.
Researchers discovered that thymoquinone therapy of leukemia cells with stimulated apoptosis caused the death of cells, suggesting it to be a potential leukemia cure.
The University of Mississippi Medical Center conducted a study in 2007 which stated that the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil remains the chemotherapeutic gold-standard for the treatment of colon cancer, but it can have numerous harmful side- effects, as it kills both, unhealthy as well as healthy cells.
Their study was, in fact, a response to previous studies stating that antioxidants deter certain disease processes, particularly cancer. Therefore, tier study included epigallocatechin-3-gallate, the most abundant catechin in green tea, and thymoquinone, the essential anti-cancer ingredient of black seeds.
The study evaluated the role of sustained delivery of catechin from green tea, thymoquinone from black seeds, and the chemotherapy drug 5-FU on the structural changes in human colon cancer cells, as well as the metabolic activity, in laboratory cultures.
Findings demonstrated a significant destruction and interference with the cellular metabolic functions in the case of green tea catechin and black seed thymoquinone, which was proportionate to cells subjected to sustained drug delivery of the chemotherapy drug 5-FU.
The morphological cell alterations took place after exposure to green tea catechin and thymoquinone for 24 hours, which was equal to the cellular changes in cells exposed to the chemotherapy drug 5-FU.
This showed that these two natural agents may provide the same benefits in the case of colon cancer, but avoid all the harmful side-effects.
Lebanese researchers in 2004 confirmed the amazing power of black seed oil to prevent and treat cancer. They stated that black seed and black seed oil have been used in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East and Africa to prevent numerous diseases and to successfully treat the existing ones.
“Thymoquinone, the most abundant constituent present in black seed, is a promising dietary agent for preventing cancer. We investigated the effects of thymoquinone against human colon cancer cells. We report that thymoquinone inhibits the growth of colon cancer cells. Our data support the potential for using thymoquinone for the treatment of colon cancer.”
A Saudi Arabian research in 2010 claimed that the root of numerous diseases is, in fact, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), especially peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer and chronic active gastritis.
Therefore, the effective treatment of this infection will treat these associated diseases. Yet, it becomes growing resistant to the antibiotic therapy, so it needs to be treated in a new way. Black seeds have powerful anti-helicobacter properties.
Therefore, this study examined their efficacy in the elimination of H. pylori infection in 88 human non-ulcer dyspeptic patients. Patients were randomly divided into 4 groups, and received four different combinations of clarithromycin and/or amoxicillin (antibiotics), omeprazole (anti-gastric reflex drug), and black seed oil.
Black seeds were found to have the strongest anti-H. pylori activity, comparable to the combination of all three drugs.
Newest research found another protective effect of thymoquinone, against the cardiotoxicity of the chemotherapy agent doxorubicin. Hence, this means that thymoquinone boosts the anti-cancer effect of doxorubicin in some cancer cell lines.
A study conducted in Singapore in 2013 showed that there is a reduced number of therapeutic agents for cancer, and affected cells are becoming resistance to them.
This points out the need for new anti- cancer agents. The powerful anti- cancer properties of thymoquinone, were used to treat mice with breast cancer, and were discovered to reduce the cancer growth. This remarkable effect was boosted by combining it with doxorubicin.
The review of the published studies about black seeds by the researchers from Wayne State University in Michigan claimed that there is a great need of new studies that will examine the bioavailability and Phase-I toxicity profiling in human subjects.
However, a researcher from Oman believes that thymoquinone has been extensively studied, in test tube research with human cancer cells, as well as in animal studies with induced forms of cancer. Due to those studies, we have generated a significant amount of data and now it is time to move the research to clinical experiments.
The existence of over 120 scientific research studies on the use of black seed oil and thymoquinone in the case of different cancer types poses a question why are they still laboratory studied. If the black seed oil, as well as its extract, contains so powerful cancer- fighting properties, and their use has no side effects, then why the medicine does not use these findings?
Black seeds have been commonly used throughout the human history. Traditional folk medicine has been using their numerous health benefits since the time of the Egyptian Pharaohs. Namely, researchers discovered black seed oil in the tomb of the Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamen.
Moreover, archeologists also found a mixture of black seeds, beeswax, and honey in north- central Turkey, placed in a pilgrim flask from the Old Hittite Period level of Boyall
And despite all this, black seeds are still locked on laboratories as some unproven medicine.
First of all, they are edible, can be used to enhance the flavor of foods, and are added to remedies and tonics for thousands of years. Therefore, why to still test them whether they are safe?
We just need to develop a procedure in which we can use their benefits. Therefore, we need to conduct clinical trials.
The reason for this situation is due to the pressure and control of pharmaceutical companies. Namely, conventional chemotherapy drugs have reduced effects, studies show that the combination of black seed oil and conventional drugs provides better effects, when compared to the effect of chemotherapy drugs by themselves.
Also, research has also found thymoquinone to be equally effective as chemotherapy drugs at times but provides no detrimental side- effects. In terms of profit, this is no good news for the pharmaceutical industry.
Another important issue is patenting. Namely, the pharmaceutical industry tends to gain control over a natural substance and add it to an existing drug with an expiring patent and create something “new” which can, of course, be patented. This was the case with folate (vitamin B9), and FDA helped the entire strategy.
Therefore, pharmaceutical companies would rather add thymoquinone to their ineffective medications, and boost their effect. Thymoquinone has been found to be equally effective as chemotherapy drugs and has no side effects, but they cannot profit from its use. Due to all this, there are no interest or funds to stimulate human trials with a natural substance like black seed oil or thymoquinone, as they cannot be patented and are not profitable.
The sad truth is that billions of people are suffering fro cancer, and experience all the unpleasant symptoms of conventional treatments while they can help themselves by using natural remedies.
Studies have shown that black seed oil successfully prevents radiation damage to healthy tissue if taken before radiation therapy and regularly afterward. Yet, the fact that these findings have never been published is extremely offendable against people who undergo radiation treatment to treat their cancer.
This miraculous oil has a remarkable protective ability in the case of radiation and chemotherapy and is a powerful anti-cancer agent. Yet, we have no information on how to use it, as there is no research to confirm an effective protocol with a determined dosage.
Yet, numerous studies indicate that the best results are obtained when consumed on a daily basis.
Some people claim that the use of 1 to 3 teaspoons of black seed oil a day may help you treat numerous health conditions. A teaspoon a day is enough to strengthen health, and 2 or three a day are recommended in the case of specific diseases.
It can be mixed with honey, as well as topically applied to the skin at times. In order to use it to help some health issue, you can do some research on your own and find the needed information.

"The term ""super food"" has become quite trendy in the last few years thanks to a renaissance of holistic wellness, celebrity endorsements and companies capitalizing on this newfound interest.
Though foods like quinoa and chia seeds are becoming more popular in the U. S. now, Latin Americans have been harvesting and eating them for thousands of years. Our ancestors were doing something right by consuming these plants and seeds that Mother Nature made available.
Here are six of our ethnic ""super foods"" that we should be eating regularly. They're healthy and delicious.
Called an ""ancient grain,"" quinoa has been cultivated for over 5,000 years in South America. It was so important that it was considered the “Gold of the Incas” because they believed it increased the strength and stamina of their warriors.
* Possible health benefits: Quinoa is one of the most protein-rich foods we can eat — it’s a complete protein, like meat, eggs and dairy products, and contains all nine essential amino acids that help build muscle. It also contains almost twice as much fiber as most other grains.
* Origin: Grows high in the Andes Mountains of Peru and Bolivia.
* How you can use it: Salads (like this one), porridge and a perfect substitute for rice!
Chia is an edible seed, dating back from the Mayan and Aztec cultures. Its name means “strength” in the Mayan language. Warriors would take a pouch of seeds and a gourd of water on their trips; the seeds were their food source and taken with water they would hydrate their bodies for endurance.
* Possible health benefits: Chia seeds have twice the protein of any other seed or grain and five times the calcium of milk, they also have omega 3 and omega 6 which are essential oils for the body.
* Also, just one ounce of chia seeds provides 10 grams of fiber, which is important for lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
* How you can use it: Sprinkle on salads, smoothies, chia seeds pudding (like this one), sprinkle in your water/juices for agua fresca, and even on your favorite cocktails for a healthy twist (like this one).
The acai berry is an inch-long, reddish-purple fruit. It comes from the acai palm tree.
* Possible health benefits: Acai berries have more antioxidants per serving than any other berries, and they're packed with amino acids as well as vitamins A, B, C and E and minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper and zinc.
* Origin: Central and South America, especially Brazil where they grow in parts of the Amazonian rain forest.
* How you can use it: In powder version, you can use it in your smoothies, the famous acai bowls (like this one), on your oats, yogurt, etc. Freeze dried Acai pulp is also available.
Endemic to Brazil, cacao beans were put on the map by the Mayas, who figured out how to ferment cacao and then began to trade it as a tribute to Aztecs when they were conquered by them. Don't confuse it with chocolate; it's not the same. Cacao is the purest form of chocolate; this means it’s raw and much less processed than cocoa powder or chocolate bars which typically have high amounts of sugar and milk.
* Possible health benefits: Cacao is rich in flavonoids and is an antioxidant. It's touted as good for combating stress, helping with mental alertness and stamina and warding off heart disease.
* Some studies suggest that eating dark chocolate in moderation could be good for the heart.
* How you can use it: In baked goods, smoothies, homemade raw foods, oats (like this one), cacao nibs for salads, breakfast bowls, and smoothies, etc.
It’s a berry-like fruit that has been used by native Amazonian Indians for generations. Traditionally Camu Camu harvesting occurred directly on the rivers, with locals pulling the berries from the shrubs directly onto their canoes.
* Possible health benefits: It has 60 times more vitamin C per serving than an orange and even than acai. Some tout it as a mood and energy booster and as good support for the nervous system, and some believe its high levels of vitamin C can help lessen cold sores and other viruses.
* How you can use it: Use it in powder form and sprinkle it onto your oatmeal or a smoothie (like this one) to inject a tart flavor and an anti-inflammatory boost.
This fruit has been consumed for thousands of years; it's looks like an avocado with a hard green exterior covering the sweet, soft fruit. The flesh is yellow and has a texture that is slightly reminiscent to that of a sweet potato and has a slight caramel taste.
* Possible health benefits: Lucuma is high in antioxidant beta carotene (indicated by the fruit's bright yellow flesh), which can help prevent cancer and has anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties; it's also beneficial in healing wounds. It also has high levels of iron and vitamin B3 (known for its positive effects on depression).
* How to use it: Finding the fruit in the U.S. can be hard, so your best bet is the powdered form, which you can use to flavor all sorts of dishes where you want a maple undertone. Use it on smoothies, porridge, desserts and cakes.
These super foods are healthy and easy to integrate into your diet, so happy eating!

"The shocking moment a high school student launched a racist attack on his science teacher has been captured on camera.
The student, who has been named online and across social media as Gideon Yapp, became enraged at his Eastside High School teacher in Lancaster, California, who he called ‘Dr Hsu’ during the clip
This is no way for a student to talk to their teacher! So disrespectful!Warning: This video contains strong language.
Listen as Damon chats about the student who verbally attacked his teacher in a racist rant in the podcast then read more below:
When I was at school, I honestly don’t remember there ever being a time when one of the learners stood up to a teacherand showed disrespect in any way.
Yes, we were naughty and perhaps there was the odd comment that would have been seen as backchat, but I really believe that the level of discipline in schools today has gone to the dogs.
I was left gobsmacked when I saw this video of a high school student who not only screamed at his teacher, but decided to launch a full-on racist attack too.
According to Daily Mail, the student’s name is Gideon Yapp and he can be seen launching the attack on his physics teacher, Dr. Hsu, at the Eastside High School in California.
I take my hat off to the teacher for keeping his cool through the entire episode despite being verbally abused.If I was theprincipalof this school, this kid would be expelled on the spot. Hisbehaviouris totally unacceptable!",1
"Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson, who co-directed the new stop-motion-animation film “Anomalisa,” were exploring the Whitney Museum in semi-tandem. Kaufman, a short, mordant fifty-seven-year-old who also wrote the script, as well as such films as “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” hugged the walls, studying the art. Johnson, a rangy, diffident thirty-six-year-old animator, roved to and fro, a large pale moon orbiting a small fiery sun.
“Oh, look,” Kaufman said, pointing to “Puppets,” a group of ten ceramic puppets propped in a corner. Johnson narrated: “Charlie stopped and made his way over to the puppets.” Kaufman took up the voice-over: “And said, ‘Oh, look!,’ continuing his obsession with puppets.” Unlike their film’s flexible silicone dolls, these puppets seemed incapable of drinking, smoking, or having R-rated sex. “They’re not functional,” Johnson said, losing interest.
In “Anomalisa,” a lonesome customer-service expert named Michael Stone spends a night at an oppressively functional Cincinnati hotel before addressing a group of customer-service reps. Everyone he meets has the same voice and the same blandly incomplete face—except an ingenuous rep named Lisa, whom he drunkenly falls for. It doesn’t help.
An aluminum Christmas tree by Philippe Parreno prompted discussion of whether “Anomalisa” would prove to be a crowd-pleaser for the holidays. “It might be good for the lonely people,” Kaufman said. “I think people who feel things that aren’t represented in the media feel comforted by seeing themselves represented, even if it’s in their pain. I feel that way.” Johnson, however, noted that his animation studio, Starburns Industries, had decided that its next movie would have to be more commercial. The budget had been tight, and the production was gruelling, with the team’s best animators producing just two seconds of film a day. “‘Anomalisa’ literally almost destroyed the studio,” he said. “Multiple times.”
Kaufman protested that “Anomalisa” not only might still do well but had put Starburns on the map. “We loved this experience,” Johnson said, soothingly, but he added that “it would be difficult to say ‘O. K.’ and to dive into three more years of, like, struggling every day, sometimes crying in the parking lot.” How much crying in the parking lot was there? “Charlie? All the time. You couldn’t get him out of the parking lot.”
The film’s version of a Hollywood ending is Michael returning home with a gift for his son: an antique Japanese sex doll. “He’s not the greatest dad,” Kaufman explained. The son finds semen seeping from the doll, right? “Well, it’s an antique.”
“I would have loved that as a nine-year-old kid,” Johnson said, loyally.
The younger man frowned at an incomplete office chair, part of an assemblage called “Work, Made-ready, in Light of Nature,” by Simon Starling, and wondered why it qualified as art. Kaufman recalled their visit to a Jeff Koons retrospective in Bilbao, where they saw basketballs in fish tanks. “And the woman was telling us, ‘Yeah, it’s commenting on popular culture, ’cause sports.’ ’Cause sports!”
They stopped roaming to discuss the nature of work. Kaufman said, “I think about the person in the room-service thing—who may have somebody looking over their shoulder—whose job it is to repeat back the whole description of the food item that you’ve purchased. And they don’t want to do it, you know, and you hate them. But they’re stuck in this bullshit world, too.” Johnson nodded, and Kaufman continued, “On Virgin Atlantic, coming in, the flight attendant had to show us how to use a seat belt and the air-bag thing, the oxygen mask. And they do it to this rap song, and this plane didn’t have the TV; they just had the audio track. And she, poor lady, she didn’t have to dance, thank God, but it’s, like, ‘Use the belt, do the belt, if you don’t know how to use the belt, what the hell!’ And she’s standing there doing it with a smile on her face, and I felt really bad for her.”
“She kind of kept making eye contact, like, Why are you looking at me?” Johnson said.
In his motivational speech, Michael Stone urges Lisa and her colleagues to remember that there’s a human being on the other end of the line. “I was very moved by the speech,” Johnson confessed. “There’s a lot of stuff in there.... I don’t know what it has to do with customer service.”
“He’s telling people to see each other,” Kaufman allowed, wary of explaining too much. “Which he can’t do. He’s also saying, ‘Everyone’s an individual’—and looking out at this crowd of faces that are all exactly the same.”
“It’s also how he says it,” Johnson said. “Sometimes saying something in the most direct, obvious way has the most meaning. ‘Death comes, and it’s as if you’d never existed.’” His gesture comprehended the surrounding monuments.
Kaufman corrected him, gently: “‘Death comes. That’s it. Soon, it’s as if we never existed.’”",0
"The president of Philippines Rodrigo Duterte has placed a ban on the use of Condoms few days after France bans plastic cups, plates, and cutlery in a bid to save the planet.
It’s a logical move for a country known to revel in the finer things. France this week became the first country to pass an all-out ban on plastic cutlery, plates, and cups.
Duterte applauded France for such move and the world thought he was going to follow suit but rather placed a ban on the use of Condoms.
Unlike France, Duterte’s Condom ban is not to control environmental waste but to control immortality.
According to Duterte, the ban on the use of condoms became necessary after he found that loads of used condoms are all over the streets on Manila while inspecting a project.
Philippines becomes the first country to control immortality through the ban of the use of Condoms.",1

"So many people suffer from anxiety and headaches these days. I believe this to be a mixture of our lifestyles and many of the changes that are taking place in our world that are pushing people to question what we’ve been doing as a society repetitively for many years. You know what I mean… that feeling that there is something more than just going to work, making money, coming home, eating and repeating it all. It may sound cliche, but it’s evident.
Deep down we can feel it, that something isn’t quite “right” with our world anymore and there’s a certain sense of freedom from it all that is calling us from deep within ourselves. Not knowing what that feeling is exactly or what to do, we sometimes will feel anxiety or overwhelm as we look at our lives. How do we deal with these things? There are a number of actions we can take to address the core issue which you can explore here.But I also wanted to share something simple that can aid us while we are making the more long-term adjustments.
Pure lavender oil is an incredible essential oil to use for your own health and wellness. It’s among the gentlest of essential oils, but also one of the most powerful, making it a favorite of households for the healing properties and uses of lavender essential oil. Lavender oil has a chemically complex structure with over 150 active constituents, which explains its effectiveness at helping with a lot of health ailments. Lavender oil possesses amazing anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, antidepressant, antiseptic, antibacterial, antimicrobial, antispasmodic, analgesic, detoxifier, hypotensive, and sedative properties.
Florida researchers have found thatlavender oil benefits include reducing anxiety and lowering pulse ratesin nursing students taking stressful tests. And in hospital settings, lavender aromatherapy has been demonstrated to decrease pre-surgery distress and to be more relaxing than massage or merely resting.(1)
Lavender essential oil has medicinal properties as well. It has been shown toreduce depression, improve insomnia and ease labor pains. And anecdotal evidence suggests that lavender oil benefits those with headaches, hangovers, sinus congestion and pain relief.
“Much prior research on lavender has focused on the administration of lavender via an olfactory route. The anxiolytic activity of lavender olfaction has been demonstrated in several small and medium-sized clinical trials.46-53 The efficacy of aromatherapy of lavender is thought to be due to the psychological effects of the fragrance combined with physiological effects of volatile oils in the limbic system.54 These calming effects of lavender oil and single constituents may be the origin of the traditional use of lavender. Lavender oil olfaction has been shown to decrease anxiety, as measured by the Hamilton rating scale,51 and can increase mood scores.
* Dunn and colleagues demonstrated anxiolytic activity of lavender oil aromatherapy in patients in intensive care units. Subjects received at least 1 session of aromatherapy with 1% lavender essential oil. Significant anxiolytic effects were noted in the 1st treatment, though 2nd and 3rd treatments did not appear to be as effective.47
* Alaoui-Ismaili and colleagues found that the aroma of lavender is considered by subjects to be very pleasant and is correlated with changes in the autonomic nervous system.56
* Tysoe and colleagues conducted a study of lavender oil in burner use on staff mood and stress in a hospital setting. A significant number of respondents (85%) believed that lavender aroma improved the work environment following the use of the lavender oil burners.57
* Diego and colleagues demonstrated that people receiving lavender oil (10%) olfaction for 3 minutes felt significantly more relaxed and had decreased anxiety scores, improved mood and increased scores of alpha power on EEG (an indicator of alertness), and increased speed of mathematical calculations.58
* Lewith and colleagues investigated the effects of lavender aromatherapy on depressed mood and anxiety in female patients being treated with chronic hemodialysis.59 The effects of aromatherapy were measured using the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD) and the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety (HAMA). Lavender aroma significantly decreased the mean scores of HAMA, suggesting an effective, noninvasive means for the treatment of anxiety in hemodialysis patients.
* Lavender aromatherapy, with or without massage, may also reduce the perception of pain and the need for conventional analgesics in adults and children, though more rigorously controlled trials are needed.60″ (2)
Mix all ingredients together and chill. Add more water or raw honey if needed.
Mix 5 to 6 drops of Lavender essential oil to your bath water if you have dry skin.
Diffuse 10 to 12 drops of Lavender into the air during your workday for natural stress relief.
Add 2 drops of Lavender per ounce of your favorite lightly scented, unrefined organic oil (like almond oil or olive oil) for a body oil with all the benefits of lavender for improving your skin, relaxing your mind, warding off insects or helping you sleep.

"Out of all the years that I’ve been writing about prepping, this has been the year of the wake-up call. If one good thing has come from all the disasters, it’s the fact that many people have seen the light and learned a hard, firsthand lessons and want to start prepping.
* Hurricane Harveytaught people that places which didn’t normally flood were still not exempt from Mother Nature and that the aftermath was rife with danger.
* Thewildfires in Californiataught people that they needed a rapid evacuation plan for themselves and their pets.
* Hurricane Mariataught us that life could completely and utterly change for millions of people whose homes were destroyed and who may not have the grid back anytime in the near future.
* Hurricane Irmawas one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the state in many years. Millions of people were warned to evacuate. Residentsfaced destruction and lengthy interruptionsin power and the availability of supplies.
* Throughout all these disasters, we got confirmation that all hell DOES indeed break loose and that we won’t be able to rely on 911, no matter how stringentlythe “everything is okay” mythis reinforced by the media.
All of these horrible things have one silver lining…more people than ever realize that the government won’t be rushing to save them anytime soon and that they must be prepared to be completely on their own.
So if this is you, welcome to the prepped side. I have put together a little primer for you. It isn’t over the top. You don’t need a bunker and an AK47 for each family member. You just need food, water, shelter, and an evacuation plan. No tinfoil required.
There are links in each section where you can go to learn more about that topic. At the end is a resource list with some shortcuts and some useful books. You don’t have to do every single thing RIGHT NOW. This is just a preparedness overview and if you have recently been through an emergency, you will probably recognize what your priorities should be.
If you never buy a single canned good or bag of pasta for long-term food storage, please store water. Every time there’s a pending emergency, the shelves at stores are completely cleared of water within a matter of hours (if not sooner.)
If you went out and bought it, a full month’s supply of drinking water for a family of 4 would cost approximately $150, depending on the prices in your area. I recommend the refillable 5-gallon water jugs for this. This is a small investment to make for your family’s security and well-being in the event of an emergency.
As well, fill empty containers with tap water. Every container that comes into your house can be used for these purposes. When you empty a jar or bottle, wash it, fill it up, and stash it somewhere. Even if these containers aren’t food safe, you can use them for flushing, cleaning, and hygiene.
Once you have water stored, consider adding filtration devices, secondary water sources, and water harvesting to your preparedness endeavors. You can learn more about water preparedness inmy book on the topic, andHERE,HERE, andHERE.
Lots of preppers like to keep ayear’s supply of foodon hand. If you’re just getting started out, that can bein incredibly overwhelming. Start out smaller than that – focus first on an extra two weeks, then on a month’s supply. You can always build from there.
Keep in mind when building your emergency food supply that you might not have electricity during some disasters. In that case, you’ll want to have food that doesn’t require lengthy (or any) cooking times. Look for just-add-water dehydrated foods, or better yet, foods that don’t need to be cooked at all. Search for an off-grid cooking method that will work for your home.
Do not make the mistake of loading your pantry with nutritionless processed foods. In a crisis event, you want your body to work optimally, and junk in means junk out. Focus on nutrient-dense foods for good health and energy no matter what’s going on in the world around you.
* Get an emergency stove that can be used indoorsHERE.
A great starting point for someone who is just getting started on a preparedness journey isprepping specifically for a two-week power outage. If you can comfortably survive for two weeks without electricity, you will be in a far better position than most of the people in North America.
Lighting is absolutely vital, especially if there are children in the house. Nothing is more frightening than being completely in the dark during a stressful situation. Fortunately, it’s one of the easiest things to plan for, as well as one of the least expensive.
Learn about prepping for a two-week power outage in more detailHERE.
A common cause of illness, and even death, during a down-grid situation is lack of sanitation. We’ve discussed the importance of clean drinking water, but you won’t want to use your drinking water to keep things clean or to flush the toilet.
For cleaning, reduce your need to wash things.
* Stock up on paper plates, paper towels, and disposable cups and flatware.
* Keep some disinfecting cleaning wipes and sprays (I don’t recommend using antibacterial products on a regular basis, however, in the event of an emergency they can help to keep you healthy.)
* Use hand sanitizer after using the bathroom and before handling food or beverages – there may be a lot more germs afoot in a disaster.
Look at your options for sanitation. Does your toilet still flush when the electricity is out? Many people discovered the hard way that the toilets didn’t work when the sewage backed up in the highrises in New York City in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. At our cabin, the toilet won’t flush without power because the pump is electric.
If you are on a septic system, with no risk of the toilet backing up into the house, simply store some water for flushing in the bathroom. (At the first sign of a storm, we always filled the bathtub for this purpose when we had a home on septic.) Add the water to the tank so that you can flush.
If this is not an option, another solution is to stock up on extremely heavy duty garbage bags (like the kind that contractors use at construction sites) and kitty litter. Place a bag either in your drained toilet or in a bucket. Sprinkle some kitty litter in the bottom of the bag. Each time someone uses the bathroom, add another handful of litter. Be very careful that the bag doesn’t get too heavy for you to handle it. Tie it up very securely and store it outside until services are restored. Learn how to make a kitty litter toilet in more detailHERE.
If your power outage takes place in the winter and you live in a colder climate, heat is another necessity. During the first 24 hours after a power outage, you can stay fairly warm if you block off one room of the house for everyone to group together in. Keep the door closed and keep a towel or blanket folded along the bottom of the door to conserve warmth. You can safely burn a couple of candles also, and in the enclosed space, your body heat will keep it relatively warm. As well, dress in layers and keep everything covered – wear a hat, gloves (fingerless ones allow you to still function), and a scarf.
* ClickHEREto learn how to stay warm with less heat.
* ClickHEREfor some cozy options to get your home ready for winter.
However, after about 48 hours, that’s not going to be enough in very cold weather. You will require backup heat at this point in certain climates. If you are lucky enough to have a source of heat like a fireplace or woodstove, you’ll be just fine as long as you have a supply of wood.
Consider aportable propane heater(and propane) or an oil heater. You have to be very careful what type of backup heat you plan on using, as many of them can cause carbon monoxide poisoning if used in a poorly ventilated area. Also, invest in aCarbon Monoxide alarm that is not grid-dependent.
It’s important to have a basic first aid kit on hand at all times, but particularly in the event of an emergency. Your kit should include basic wound care items like bandages, antibiotic ointments, and sprays. As well, if you use them, keep on hand a supply of basic over-the-counter medications, like pain relief capsules, cold medicine, cough syrup, anti-nausea pills, and allergy medication.
If you want to put together a more advanced medical kit, you can find a listHERE.
This is something that will be unique to every family. Consider the things that are needed on a daily basis in your household. It might be prescription medications, diapers, or special foods. If you have pets, you’ll need supplies for them too. The best way to figure out what you need is to jot things down as you use them over the course of a week or so.
It’s an unfortunate fact that disaster situations bring out the worst in many people. Because of this, even if you stay safely at home, you could be called upon to defend your property or family. Some people loot for the sheer “fun” of it, others consider chaos a free pass to commit crimes, and still others are frightened and desperate. You can have a 10 year supply of food, water, and medicine, but if you can’t defend it, you don’t own it. The articleThe Anatomy of a Breakdownexplains the predictable patterns of social unrest.
The best way to win a fight is to avoid getting into that fight in the first place.Secure your homeand lay low, butbe prepared if trouble comes to visit.
Here are some tips to make your home less of a target:
* Keep all the doors and windows locked.Secure sliding doors with a metal bar. Consider installing decorativegrid-workover a door with a large window so that it becomes difficult for someone to smash the glass and reach in to unlock the door.
* Keep the curtains closed. There’s no need for people walking past to be able to see what you have or to do reconnaissanceon how many people are present.
* Don’t answer the door.Many home invasions start with an innocent-seeming knock at the door to gain access to your house.
* Keep pets indoors. Sometimes criminals use an animal in distress to get a homeowner to open the door for them. Sometimes people are just mean and hurt animals for “fun”. Either way, it’s safer for your furry friends to be inside with you.
If, despite your best efforts, your property draws the attention of people with ill intent,you must be ready to defend your family and your home.If the odds are against you, devise a way to get your family to safety. Your property is not worth your life.
It’s very important tomake a defense planwell before you need one.This bookcan also help. You want to act, no react.
Not every emergency can be weathered at home. Sometimes there is no option but to evacuate. Some examples of this are the pending collapse of a dam, a volcano, a massive storm, flooding, wildfire, or a chemical spill. In some cases, you’ll have an hour or two to get ready before you have to leave. In other situations, there may barely be enough time to put on your shoes.
Have things set up ahead of time so your evacuation can be quick. Even if you have more time, getting on the road before everyone else gives you the advantage of being less likely to be stuck in a traffic jam while disaster bears down on you. Keep important documents in the cloud so you can access them if your home is destroyed.
Don’t wait for the evacuation order. When officials are trying to cover mismanagement or when an event occurs suddenly, you may not be warned in time.
* Here’s anevacuation checklist. Read over it and organize things well before you need to go.
* Here’san article about making the decisionwhether you should stay or go.
Here is a general list of supplies to have on hand. Rememberthat sometimes power supplies are lost during a variety of situations, so keep the potential for a down-grid situation in mind when preparing. You don’t have to get everything all at once. Just get started and build your supplies as you can. After a quick inventory and re-organization, you may be pleasantly surprised at how many supplies you actually have on hand.
Books to Help You on Your Journey
Welcome to the preparedness community!
I’m always so happy to welcome people who are new to preparedness. Read books,go to websites, and join forums anFacebook groups. While there ARE some curmudgeonly folks out there, most are delighted to answer questions and help you on your way.

"Serve this with a big plate of orange slices and rocket drizzled in lemon juice and olive oil, and with great pride.
To serve 4 shameless or 6 polite guests
chicken thighs 6, with skin and bones (about 800g)
salt 1 tsp, plus 1 tsp
pepper 1 tsp
pitted dates 100g
onions 3, peeled and sliced thinly (about 300g)
cinnamon stick 1
dried red chilli 1 (you can remove the seeds if you prefer milder flavours)
ras el hanout spice mix 2 tbsp
water 240ml
filo pastry 1 packet (about 250-270g)
melted butter 60g (or oil/other fat if avoiding dairy)
Put a large frying pan on a medium heat. Place the chicken thighs skin-side down in it and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt and the pepper. You won’t need to add any oil to cook it in, as the skin will render a lot of fat. Keep it on a medium heat and allow the skin to crisp and colour. This will take about 10–15 minutes. Once the skin is all crisp and golden, flip the thighs and cook on the other side for 5 minutes, then use tongs to remove them to an ovenproof pan that is large enough contain them all in one layer. Add the pitted dates.
Keep the fat in the frying pan and add the sliced onions and the other teaspoon of salt. Cook the onions until they are soft and starting to go golden. Add the cinnamon stick, dried chilli and ras el hanout spice and mix well. Cook for 30 seconds, then add the water and bring to the boil. Once boiling, pour over the chicken thighs in the ovenproof pan. Cover the pan and place in the centre of the oven to cook for 1 hour.
Open the lid carefully and check whether the chicken is fully cooked – it should just fall off the bone. If it is still a little tough, cook for a further 10–15 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle.
Carefully pour the contents of the pan into a sieve over a bowl. Retain the cooking liquid. Pull the chicken from the bones, discarding them along with any cartilage.
Remove the chilli and the cinnamon stick. Mix the chicken meat together with the cooked dates and onions, along with just enough liquid to bind the mixture well – any remaining liquid can be kept to warm through and use as extra sauce when serving. You can prepare this chicken-date-onion mixture up to 2 days in advance. Store in the fridge until you are ready to assemble the pastilla.
Lay the opened packet of filo pastry on the table. Carefully peel off the first sheet and use a brush to butter it, then fold into four and set aside (this folded square will give a thicker base to the pastilla). Peel off the next sheet and butter it, cover with another sheet and set aside. Repeat with two more sheets, so that you have two sheets of double thickness.
Place one doubled sheet lengthways on the table, put the folded square in the centre of it and lay the other doubled sheet on top at 90 degrees to the first sheet, to make a cross shape that is thickest in the middle.
Carefully lift the pastry cross off the table and place in a 22–24cm ovenproof frying pan or cake tin. Let it line the tin or pan with the sides of the pastry hanging over the edge. Fill with the chicken mixture and fold the corners over to cover it. We like to make the top a little crumpled so it looks natural. Brush the top of the pastry with the remaining butter and place in the centre of the oven for 15 minutes. After this time, turn the tin around so that the pastilla cooks evenly, and bake for a further 10-15 minutes or until the pastry is all golden and crisp.
Serve immediately, with a jug of the warm cooking liquid as sauce and a fresh green salad on the side.

Hummus kawarma is the Lebanese name given to freshly made hummus, topped with fried chopped lamb. It is a small meal or a starter in a bowl and one of the most sensational things you can put in your mouth. Have it with fattoush or a similar salad and pitta. Minced lamb can be used instead of chopping the meat by hand, but it won’t have quite the same gratifying texture. This dish also works well without lamb altogether, just the hummus, chickpeas, lemon sauce and pine nuts.
Serves 6
hummus 1 quantity (see recipe below), reserving 4 tbsp of the cooked chickpeas to garnish
pine nuts 2 tbsp, toasted in the oven or fried in a little unsalted butter
For the hummus
dried chickpeas 250g
bicarbonate of soda 1 tsp
light tahini paste 270g
lemon juice 4 tbsp
garlic 4 cloves, crushed
ice cold water 100ml
salt
For the kawarma
neck fillet of lamb 300g, finely chopped by hand
ground black pepper  tsp
ground white pepper  tsp
ground allspice 1 tsp
ground cinnamon  tsp
nutmeg freshly grated, a good pinch
crushed dried za’atar 1 tsp, or oregano leaves
white wine vinegar 1 tbsp
fresh mint 1 tbsp, chopped
flat-leaf parsley 1 tbsp, chopped, plus extra to garnish
salt 1 tsp
unsalted butter or ghee 1 tbsp
olive oil 1 tsp
To make the hummus, start a day before by washing the chickpeas well and placing them in a large bowl. Cover them with cold water, at least twice their volume, and leave to soak overnight.
The next day, drain the chickpeas. Place a medium saucepan on a high heat and add the drained chickpeas and the bicarbonate of soda. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add 1.5 litres of fresh water and bring to a boil. Cook, skimming off any foam and any skins that float to the surface. The chickpeas can cook for anywhere between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the type and freshness, sometimes even longer. Once done, they should be very tender, breaking up easily when pressed between your thumb and finger, almost but not quite mushy.
Drain the chickpeas. You should have roughly 600g now. Place the chickpeas in a food processor bowl. Process until you get a stiff paste; then, with the machine still running, add the tahini paste, lemon juice, garlic and 1 teaspoons of salt. Finally, slowly drizzle in the iced water and allow it to mix until you get a very smooth and creamy paste, about 5 minutes. Transfer the hummus into a bowl, cover the surface with clingfilm and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. If not using straightaway, refrigerate until needed. Make sure to take it out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before serving.
To make the kawarma, place all the ingredients apart from the butter or ghee and oil in a medium bowl. Mix well, cover and allow the mixture to marinate in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Just before you intend on cooking the meat, place all the ingredients for the lemon sauce in a small bowl and stir well.
Heat the butter or ghee and the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium–high heat. Add the meat in 2–3 batches and stir as you fry each batch for 2 minutes. The meat should be slightly pink in the middle.
Divide the hummus between 6 individual shallow serving bowls, leaving a slight hollow in the centre of each. Spoon the warm kawarma into the hollow and scatter with the reserved chickpeas. Drizzle generously with the lemon sauce and garnish with some chopped parsley and the pine nuts.

There are people who go on about plainly roasted quail, but they are far more interesting to eat if you soak them first in olive oil, garlic, something hot like chilli paste and something sharp, like lemon juice. Pomegranate seeds are interesting enough if you leave them to swell in oil and lemon – they add a sour-sweet nubbly quality to poultry or game. They are also utterly beguiling over a dish of parchment-coloured hummus with its pool of verdant oil the colour of grass.
Previously I have used pine kernels instead of pomegranate seeds, and added sultanas. I have used the hard-to-find verjuice instead of lemon, and once included a little honey in the recipe. What are recipes for if not to go with the ebb and flow of our culinary whims?
I can eat two quail, leaving nothing but a pile of well-sucked bones at the end. I have eaten them with rice and flatbread, warmed in the oven, but best of all I like them with a mint and parsley-speckled dish of cracked wheat.
Serves 3, with rice or flatbread
quail 6, oven-ready
For the marinade
garlic 3 large cloves
sea salt flakes  tsp
harissa paste 2 scant tbsp
pomegranate seeds 2 tbsp
olive oil 100ml
lemon juice 1 tbsp
rice or flatbread to serve
Peel the garlic and crush it finely with the sea salt. I use a pestle and mortar. Then scrape into a mixing bowl and stir in the harissa paste, pomegranate seeds, olive oil and lemon juice. Tuck the quail into the marinade, turning them over so that they are coated, then set aside somewhere cool for several hours. They will come to no harm should you decide to leave them overnight.
Set the oven at 190C/gas mark 5. Put the birds in a roasting tin, leaving room around each to breathe. Spoon over any excess marinade. Roast for about 25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and sticky. Serve with rice or flatbread.
Small dried limes (or lemons) are a regular feature in Iranian cooking, adding a sharp tang and sweetish aroma to marinades, stews and salads. They are rock hard and not easy to grind (although you can do so, in a coffee or spice grinder) so puncture them a couple of times and then put them in whole. You can also buy them in powdered form although this isn’t as pungent. Sumac or grated lemon zest can be used as an alternative but if you are passing a Middle Eastern grocer’s or if you shop online, they are well worth seeking out. Serve this sweet and sharp stew with steamed rice – that’s all.
Serves 6
clarified butter 50g
onion 1 large, finely diced (220g)
ground turmeric  tsp
cumin seeds 1 tsp
tomato puree 1 tbsp
coriander 20g
tarragon 10g
dill 10g
charlotte potatoes 1kg (or another waxy variety), peeled and chopped into 4cm chunks
butternut squash 1 medium (760g), peeled, deseeded and chopped into 4cm chunks
Iranian limes 3, pierced 2-3 times
green chilli 1, slit one side from stem to tip
tomatoes 4 medium, quartered (400g)
spinach leaves 150g
barberries 15g
Greek yogurt 300g (optional)
salt
Place a large casserole on a medium heat and sauté the butter, onion, turmeric and cumin for 10 minutes. Add the tomato puree and cook, stirring, for another 2 minutes. Bundle the herbs together and use some string to tie them into a bunch. Add these to the dish along with the potatoes, squash, limes, chilli, 1 teaspoons of salt and 1 litre of water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and boil gently for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are semi-cooked. Stir through the tomatoes, spinach and barberries, crushing the limes gently to release some of the juice inside, and transfer everything to a large roasting tray. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened a little and the vegetables are soft. Remove from the oven and allow to sit for 5 minutes before serving with a dollop of yogurt on the side, if you choose.
From Plenty More by Yotam Ottolenghi (Ebury Press, 27)
Manti is a staple dish in any Turkish household, found at most dinner tables and family meals up and down the country. They come stuffed with minced lamb. We use the neck in this recipe as it has a deeper flavour and becomes meltingly tender after a slow braise. It’s then topped with garlic yogurt and chilli butter.
Serves 4
For the lamb neck filling
white onions 2, whole
carrots 2
celery 1 stick
salt and pepper
lamb neck 1, whole, on the bone
For the yogurt sauce
ginger about  thumb, to taste
yogurt 70g
double cream 20g
pomegranate molasses 1 tbsp
garlic 1 clove
To make the filling, cut all the vegetables up into large chunks, and roast along with the seasoned lamb neck in an oven heated to 200C/gas mark 6 for 30 minutes or till browned.
Once roasted, cover with water and braise in the oven for 10 hours at 100C. If your oven doesn’t go that low, cook at 140C/gas mark 1 for 3 hours. The meat is ready when it falls off the bone.
After braising, pick the meat away from the bone then pull the meat apart. Strain the cooking liquid from the vegetables (discard these or use for soup) and reduce down until it’s a thick glossy glaze, then re-introduce to the meat. Season to taste and let it cool.
To make the dough, sift the flour and salt into a wide bowl and make a well in the middle. Pour in the water and using your hands, draw the flour into the liquid and mix to a dough.
Knead the dough for about 5-8 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic. Manti dough needs to be quite hard; cover the dough with a clingfilm or kitchen towel and leave to rest in a cold place or in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Cut the dough into three pieces. Working one piece of dough at a time (cover the rest of the dough pieces with a damp towel so they don’t dry out), roll the dough as thinly as you can into a sheet, on a lightly floured surface.
Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into small squares (roughly 2cm). Spoon a little of the lamb filling, the size of half a chickpea, into the middle of each square.
Pinch opposite corners to form a little pouch and press the seams together to seal firmly. Repeat with the rest of the dough and place the stuffed dumplings on a flat tray.
Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add a pinch of salt and simmer the manti for about 8-10 minutes, until they are cooked.
Once cooked, drain the water and return the manti to the pan. Drizzle a little oil over them so that they don’t stick together.
To make the chilli butter, heat the butter until it foams. Add the chilli flakes and remove from the heat. To make the yogurt sauce, grate the ginger on a fine grater. Squeeze and collect the juice. Beat the yogurt with the double cream and add in the pomegranate molasses, garlic and ginger juice to your taste. Season.
To serve, place some manti in a flat bowl, and dollop on a generous amount of yogurt sauce and some chilli butter.

"People from the blood type O group can donate blood to every other group. It’s a very unique ability to have, but on the downside, you can only receive blood from people with the same blood type. This is a big problem as blood type O is rare. But the ability of giving blood to all blood type groups is not the only unique ability these people have – according to scientists, blood type O makes you different in character as well.
Scientists say that these people are born leaders and are extremely energetic. They are always focused at their goals, and won’t let anything distract them from what they have in mind. These powerful characteristics can be found in many historic leaders.
People with blood type O are more vulnerable to ulcers and thyroid dysfunction from other people. They are also more prone to iodine deficiency and low levels of thyroid hormones which may cause adverse side-effects such as excess body weight and water retention. In Japan, blood type O has been linked to a unique type of personality – some employers might ask might even ask about your blood type group when you’re on an interview for a job! People with this blood type group are responsible, committed, organized, focused and practical and are great logicians as well. They are also good at orientation, an ability which comes from their hunter ancestors who needed to observe the environment well in order to hunt and survive.
When under a huge amount of stress, people with blood type O are hyperactive and impulsive and can get quite anxious. If this anxiety is combined with an unhealthy diet and inactive lifestyle, it may make you more prone to harmful metabolic processes such as slow thyroid, insulin resistance and weight gain. These people are also more prone to stomach acids and sensitivity, which is why they are constantly affected by ulcers. Experts recommend staying away from nicotine and alcohol if you’re in this group of people, as both compounds can be harmful and raise the level of your adrenaline, which is already high in the blood type O group. Exercising 3-4 times a week is also recommended in order to avoid further health complications.

"Before there was dabbing, there was dapping.
Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton has been nicknamed the “Dab Daddy” after popularizing the dance move this season. And although “dabbing” was developed by the rap group Migos, Newton’s high school coach said he gave a similar name to the boisterous on-field celebrations Newton enjoys.
“Dumb Ass Penalty,’’ said Dallas Allen, who was head football coach at Westlake High School in Atlanta where Newton starred. “Celebrations weren’t allowed. That was one of my rules. We weren’t going to get a 15-yard penalty because of what I called DAPs.”
But even then, there was no stiflingthe Panthers quarterback who is headed for the Super Bowl as one of the NFL’s most polarizing players. Allen recalled Newton bombing teammates with water balloons and turning off the lights when he walked into the crowded gym.
“He was always having fun,” Allen told USA TODAY Sports. “You could find Cam hanging out with the little kids, having a good time. …Everybody on the field might think they’re at work, Cam having fun.”
During the Super Bowl, Allen figures to see yet more demonstrative behavior from Newton that once would have constituted a forbidden DAP.
“Now, it’s a totally different story,’’ Allen said. “They don’t get fined for that. I just think he’s having fun. I don’t see anything wrong with it.”",0

"The Equifax data breach has generated a new, startling buzz: Do we really need to figure out a way to stop using Social Security numbers?
Seriously. Is it possible that so many crooks already have our number that there's no other way to stop the filing of fake federal tax returns or protect our IDs so that fraudsters don't open up credit cards in our names?
Has the Social Security number outlived its usefulness? That was suggested by cybersecurity coordinator Rob Joyce, who spoke this week at a cyber conference organized by The Washington Post.
The White House is looking at ways to phase out the use of Social Security numbers, Joyce said.
Former Equifax CEO Richard Smith testified this week in Washington, too, that another system is needed other than using Social Security numbers following rising numbers of hacks.
There are no details of how this would work. And don't expect any quick changes, either, even as we grapple with the fallout from the Equifax data breach first announced Sept. 7.
More: There's no law they can pass against stupid, House committee tells ex Equifax CEO
More: The Equifax breach just got worse: What to do if you were hit
More: 10 stats that show why Social Security is broken
The Equifax story, of course, just grows more annoying for consumers by the minute.
This week, Equifax bumped up its number and now says hackers may have stolen personal information from up 145.5 million people, or 2.5 million more thaninitially reported.
The Equifax breach involved Social Security numbers, birth dates, names and addresses. Equifax noted that some driver's license numbers may have been stolen, too.
It's not uncommon, of course, for retailers, restaurants and othersto revise their numbers upward after the first announcement of a security breach.
Brian Krebs, who writes the blog KrebsOnSecurity.com, said he'd suspect that one day we'll be told that even more people will turn out to have been compromised as part of the Equifax breach.
""I've been telling people to assume you're compromised,"" he said.
Krebs pointed outin an article this week that Yahoosaid 1 billion accounts were hit by a cyber attack in 2013. But this week, Verizon Communications, which acquired Yahoo in June, disclosed thatall 3 billion of Yahoo’s user accounts were compromised.
With the Yahoobreach, crooks obtained names, birth dates, phone numbers and passwords, as well as security questions used to reset lost passwords.
Krebs — who tracks what's for sale via the many online marketplaces that criminals use — said it's hard to know where some stolen data came from at this point because there have been so many breaches.
He has noticed a lot of scammers this past month who are trying to trick other con artists into thinking they have the ""Equifax"" data for sale online.
More infuriating news: The Internal Revenue Service somehow saw fit to award a multimillion dollar no-bid contract to Equifax to prevent fraud in late September.The service is toverify taxpayer identities.
Krebs said the Equifax verification model, which asks personal questions such asinformation about your past car loans or a mortgage, can be readily found elsewhere online.
Krebs reported in May about another hacking incident involving an Equifax subsidiary, TALX, which provides online payroll and tax services.
Equifax said then that crooks were able to reset a 4-digit PIN given to customer employees as a password and then steal W-2 tax data aftersuccessfully answering personal questionsabout those employees.
ID thieves, of course, can use data from W-2 forms to file fraudulent federal income tax returns to engage in tax refund fraud.
""It's not hard to see why people are getting so cynical about this,"" Krebs said. ""Equifax does not view consumers as their customers — they're the product.""
As for trying to move away from Social Security numbers — developed in 1936 — as an ID, it's a giganticstep for banks, employers and others to totally abandonthe practice.
""We do need to develop a new verification system based on some sort of two-factor authentication that does not include Social Security numbers,"" said Mike Litt, consumer advocate for the Public Interest Research Group.
Litt said the organization's leadership has called for moving away from Social Security numbers for adecade. PIRG experts gave testimony in Washington in 2003 indicating that ""over-use and easy access to Social Security numbers helps drive the identity theft epidemic.""
""Fundamentally, this nation needs to wean the private sector of its over-reliance on Social Security numbers as unique identifiers and database keys,"" saidEdmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director for PIRG.
John Ulzheimer, a credit expert who formerly worked for credit-scoring company FICO, said perhaps Social Security numbers could be restricted to track earnings.
He notedother combinations of data can be used for many financial services.
""Heck, my phone and several of my bank's apps use my fingerprint for authentication,"" Ulzheimer said.
But he acknowledges this might be a tough sell.
""That will be a slow-turning ship, though, given how ingrained Social Security numbers have become,"" he said.

"What You'll Need for the Cake:
knife (for adult use only)
What You'll Need for Decoration:
How to Make the Cake:
Mix cake as directed on the box.
Pour two-thirds of the batter into a greased oven-safe bowl. Pour remainder of batter into prepared muffin pan. Fill each cup about three-quarters full.
Bake as directed. Place in oven side-by-side. The cupcakes will probably finish sooner than the cake. Using a toothpick or knife, check both batters as they cook. The toothpick or knife should come out clean.
Allow cupcakes and cake to cool in the pans for 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove from pans and set on wire baking rack to cool. The cake must be cooledcompletelybefore you ice it, or you'll end up with crumbs in your frosting.
How to Decorate the Cake:
Drawing George's face is actually just a matter of drawing and arranging some simple shapes. Use the instructions below and the picture above to learn how.
Make George's face:Spread the caramel frosting in the shape of a large ""8,"" stretching from top to bottom on the cake.Smooth out the frosting as much as you can by pulling a knife or rubber spatula lightly across the surface.Leave the sides unfrosted.
Make George's ears:Frost one cupcake, using the caramel frosting.Cut the cupcake in half, vertically.Position the cupcake halves symmetrically, close to the top of the cake so they look like ears.Secure the cupcake halves to the sides of the round cake with caramel frosting.Note: You will end up with extra cupcakes that you can frost and save for the party or enjoy for yourself.
Make George's eyes:Using the chocolate sandwich cookies, pull each cookie apart and use the side with the filling on it.Scrape away at the filling until you have what looks like a large black pupil.Place on George's face.For the eyebrows, use the black icing to draw a line above each eye.
Make George's nose:Using the black icing, draw a small arc below George's eyes.To make the nostrils, draw two smaller arcs below the larger arc.
Make George's mouth:Using the black icing, draw a shallow ""U"" about 1 1/2 inches below George's nose.Draw a second, slightly deeper and shorter ""U"" below the top ""U.""Connect the two ""U"" shapes with a small ""laugh"" line to complete George's smile.To make George's tongue, sprinkle about a teaspoon of red sugar in the middle of his mouth. Use red icing if you are unable to find red sugar.Note: You can also use black licorice to make George's mouth.",0
"What's For Dinner? The Options For A Fast Answer Multiply : The Salt   As many as 80 percent of Americans don't know what's for dinner by 4 p.m. that same day. From in-grocery store restaurants to local, organic cafeteria fare, new options for fast meals are cropping up.

What's For Dinner? The Options For A Fast Answer Multiply
Here in Washington, it's getting late in the day. Do you know what you're having for dinner? According to the food data company Food Genius, as many as 80 percent of you don't. Answering that question is a growing business. In collaboration with Youth Radio, NPR's Sonari Glinton asked the age-old question, what's for dinner?
SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Let's face it. Knowing what you're going to have for dinner ahead of time isn't nearly as important as it used to be. Increasingly, we're calling audibles. I'm standing in the parking lot at the new Shake Shack in West Hollywood, and it's just one of hundreds of choices I have in this neighborhood. Now, answering the question what's for dinner, it's pretty easy here. And that's true for a good part of the U. S. But that wasn't the case, say, I don't know, 30 years ago.
DOROTHY GLINTON: I knew what we were going to eat when I come out the grocery store on a Saturday all week.
S. GLINTON: Look, once in a career you can put your own mom on the radio. And I'm doing it now because if there ever was an expert in putting food on the table, I telling you, it's Dorothy Glinton.
D. GLINTON: And cooking wasn't a big deal for me. And it wasn't - it was easy stuff. Put a pot roast in the oven while we did homework at night so the next day all I had to do was heat it up. And I always knew what I was going to cook. I didn't come in running.
S. GLINTON: Now, back then, I never ate fast food because I grew up with a mom who wouldn't allow it. Now, though, even she eats out on weeknights.
D. GLINTON: But I don't go to a restaurant when I - you know, in the evening. I do most of my eating in a grocery store now, picking up a hot soup, going to a salad bar.
S. GLINTON: That's Bonnie Riggs. She's a restaurant industry analyst for the NPD Group.
RIGGS: A groceraunt is a grocery store like a Mariano's that offers prepared meals for immediate consumption.
S. GLINTON: Riggs says grocery stores offering prepared meals are just one example. The point is how we answer that question, what's for dinner, it's changing.
RIGGS: I don't know if I'm going out to dinner or if I'm going to go home and cook. And I just have not been cooking as much lately as I have historically.
S. GLINTON: Well, that's because she doesn't have to. As she drives home from work, Riggs will pass hundreds of places offering high-quality, fresh food at reasonable prices - grocery stores, food trucks, takeout, drive-thrus. Even Uber delivers food. And old restaurant concepts, like the automat and the cafeteria, are making a comeback.
I'm at Picnic LA with Elliott Silver and Noah Ellis and - the two restaurant guys who used to own a fancy pants restaurant in Beverly Hills. What was the name of it?
S. GLINTON: What made you go from wanting to, like, open a high-end restaurant to opening what is a - what I have to - no offense - I have to call a high-end cafeteria?
SILVER: Same reason we opened Red Medicine. We wanted to open a restaurant we wanted to eat at.
S. GLINTON: For 15 bucks at Picnic LA in Culver City, you can get an entree like poached salmon and two sides. Think cafeteria but really nice - local, organic and a little hipster.
NOAH ELLIS: So we try to display the produce, right? We've got Weiser Farm potatoes, par-cooked, the little gems just came in, the asparagus from Zuckerman's, fennel from JF Organics.
S. GLINTON: One reason Silver and Ellis did not start another full-service restaurant is labor costs. The minimum wage is going up. Picnic LA might serve, say, 150 people tonight. They will need just six employees to do that.
ELLIS: We were eating in sort of higher end restaurants and just wanted to make it more accessible.
S. GLINTON: Now, Picnic LA is a new type of restaurant that didn't exist a few years ago. But it too faces competition.
MATT SALZBERG: My name is Matt Salzberg, and I am a co-founder and CEO of Blue Apron.
S. GLINTON: Blue Apron is an online service that delivers the ingredients and recipes, everything you need to make your dinner.
SALZBERG: Interest in food is higher than it's ever been, but culinary skills are ironically lower than they've ever been.
S. GLINTON: The Food Channel, Martha Stewart and even Rachael Ray have helped give us more knowledge about food and culinary culture. But our schedules are keeping us from practicing our cooking skills in our own kitchens.
SALZBERG: We like to cook but we found it expensive. We found it difficult to assemble ingredients. And we found it inaccessible.
S. GLINTON: Blue apron isn't the only new food delivery service. GrubHub, AmazonFresh, even Uber is getting in on the dinner game says Bonnie Riggs.
RIGGS: A restaurant operator can get into the delivery business now without having to have the - all of the liability, all the things associated with it 'cause they can partner with one of these companies that deliver. So it is a growth area, both in-home and away from home.
S. GLINTON: Riggs points out that visits to traditional fast-food chains are down while fast-casual is up. Prepared foods at big-box stores, convenience stores and grocery stores are bigger and bigger portions of those companies' profit. If a few short years ago the hipsters were opening farm-to-table restaurants, now it's all fast-casual and high-end cafeterias. Again, Elliot Silver.
SILVER: I think it's cyclical, but it's evolutionary too. Like, I think people wanting better quality food, that's a forever thing. I think how they have that and the kind of dining experiences they want to have, that's cyclical.
S. GLINTON: Silver and Ellis say they see about 10 years left in the fast-casual boom before we all turn to the next thing. I asked them if they thought the more mature players - you know, McDonald's and Chipotle, et cetera - should be afraid of the competition.
ELLIS: If they're willing to really look at what's going on, they can certainly come up with anything that's competitive in a heartbeat. You know, it'd be really arrogant to say, you know, these multi-multi-multibillion-dollar companies need to worry about something like us.
S. GLINTON: In Los Angeles, there are dozens of these restaurants based on some mix of farm to table and quick service. Ellis and Silver say it's a new space where the small guy can compete and maybe be the one that comes up with the next big thing because now that consumers can see the choices, they'll keep asking for more. Sonari Glinton, NPR News, West Hollywood.

"Read the article to see how to write the best conclusion in your life if you’re creating an essay, a book, a novel, an academic paper or any other type of the text.
A good ending can turn a terrible story into a fantastic one. No matter what you’re writing, a great conclusion can make the readers fall in love with your style of writing and become your fans forever. How’s that possible? What are the tricks that most of the successful writers use in their books? Let’s try to break the spell of the best sellers and figure out what you can add to your book or essay ending to make it the best.
If you make your readers think of your essay after they finish reading it, it will be great. And the more complicated the question is the better impression you will provide. If you’re writing an argumentative essay, you can ask about personal opinion of the readers and their attitude to the problem. If you discuss a controversial topic, you can ask a question that will evoke some emotions that will make the readers think of your essay for a long time.
Another type of the question might be the one that you used in the introduction or the body of your essay. You can start the text with the question and finish it with the same phrase. We mean the last sentence of the conclusion here. In short, you will need to write a standard concluding paragraph and put the question at the end of it.
You could notice it in some of the books where the author describes every event and character in so much detail that the ending looks weird and interesting at once. This will only work if you love describing every single detail of a person or a thing. Every paragraph should be written this way but the concluding ones will greatly differ from the rest. You can use a heading for it or surprise the readers if you don’t do it.
The main goal here is:
* To make them focus on reading more;
* To make them think of your book for a long time.
The time lapse means describing events and people with no detail. It means that you completely change your narrative style at the end of the book. You can make readers think that they start reading a new book. You will surely achieve the goal to make people remember your book for a long time as they won’t see it in most of other books. And they will recommend your book for their friends and colleagues.
Use the word “Conclusion” to make the readers see what the next section of the novel is about. Don’t worry, you won’t make the ending too obvious for your readers as they will pay more attention to your novel. A few authors use this trick, but they succeed if they really do it. We’ve never seen the authors that wrote bad conclusions and used this heading for it. So why don’t you try and see the result?
But you should pay more attention to writing such a concluding part of your novel as you cannot present any new things or factions in this part. You can only write about the results or the outcomes of the things that happened in the main part of the text. Of course, you can use any language style that you prefer as it’s not an academic paper. Your goal is to make a good ending that will look like crossing the finish line when running a marathon, so do it well.
If you’re writing an academic paper, using a lot of descriptive adjectives or plague words is not the best idea to use. You can remove all unnecessary words from the text and leave only bare facts about the research that you have conducted. It doesn’t mean that you need to make the conclusion boring or dull. You can play with the words and the succession of the sentences in the part of the paper.
You can use bare facts and make up a poem out of them. To do this, you will only need to find the figures or the words that can be rhymed and put them into the right position. If you can read the conclusion without stops, it will mean that you have chosen the right rhythm for it. You can put your sentences in a chronological order or any other that you like. Don’t make it boring and spend enough time on writing it.
Here we’ll make our own conclusion where we will sum everything up. You should choose the type of the ending that will match the overall style of your paper, novel or book. You should also consider the preferences and requirements of your readers especially if their meaning is valuable for you. Or you can fully rely on your talent and your inspiration that will push you hard to create a unique piece of writing that will impress the readers.
Don’t worry if someone doesn’t like your conclusion. You don’t like all the books in the world, do you? So every human has own taste about the books and any papers that they read in their lives. If you want to make your book a bestseller, you should always consider the tastes of your audiences and meet their expectations. Writing conclusions is a hard job, so do your best not to fail it.",1

GOP readies what may be its final attempt to repeal Obamacare
Senators Lindsey Graham (pictured) and Bill Cassidy have proposed a healthcare plan in a potentially final effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)
Republicans vowed to replace ObamaCare. With premiums rising, insurance providers wavering, and leading Democrats laying the groundworkforthe federal government to become the sole provider of healthcare, some GOP senators are taking one final, high-stakes shot at repealing the Affordable Care Act.
Senators Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) have a plan (read a detailed summary here).
Give federal money to states to set up their own healthcare systems, rather than being bound by ObamaCare
Why is it now or never?
Between now and Sept. 30, Republicans can pass a healthcare bill through the Senate with only 51 votes through budget reconciliation. After that, due to a procedural ruling, it would take 60 votes.
Why is that important? Because Republicans obviously aren’t getting 60 votes since Democrats universally oppose a repeal of Obamacare. But they could at least feasibly get to 50, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote in favor of the measure.
Congress is only in session three days this week, so this will likely come down to the final week of the month, which is open only because the government funding bill was passed earlier than normal. GOP leadership prefers to use the extra time on tax reform, but some Republican senators aren’t willing to let Obamacare repeal go.
Cassidy estimates that they have 49 votes in favor of the bill. A
What happens if these Republican senators fail?
Democrats don’t have much power in government these days, but that hasn’t stopped them from coming up with grand plans for the future.
As detailed in this piece by Leon Wolf, the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are stepping over one anotherto get furtherleft on healthcare, coming out in support of a single-payer system.
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders dropped his “Medicare for All” planon the world last week, proposing a plan for the federal government to become the only healthcare provider over the course of a four-year transition period (although he neglected to detail how that plan would be paid for).
Sanders’ plan has 16 co-sponsors, some of whom will likely be together on a primary debate stage in a few years, such as Senators Kamala Harris (California), Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), Cory Booker (New Jersey) and Kirsten Gillibrand (New York).
Regardless of the chances of this specific plan becoming a reality, to set the bar so far left signals that if Republicans can’t get something done on healthcare, the momentum that began in 2009 with Obamacare couldsnowball into an even more liberal, big-government healthcare system in America in the coming years.

"Headaches are common, especially nowadays, but before you reach for the nearest drug you have at home, you should consider a rather healthier, natural alternative, that will avoid the adverse effects of pharmaceuticals.
Namely, there is a trick which includes a banana and water and provides miraculous effects. Yet, it is not as effective in all types of headaches.
Hence, there are hundreds of different types of headaches, and billions of people annually are misdiagnosed when they seek medical help for the symptoms they experience. All headache types are not still not précised, and thus, the proper treatment of a headache varies.
Often, your headaches may be a result of a simple cause, like fatigue or dehydration, but at times, they may indicate a serious health issue.
Dr. Sakib Qureshi MD, an experienced neurologist, provides an explanation of the “red light warning signals” that are experienced along headaches, and how to make the difference between a temporary headache and a more severe headache type.
Therefore, it is of high importance to take some time and follow the symptoms you experience before you reach for medication, as they will tell a lot about your health.
There are four major and most common types of headaches, and all of them indicate an issue that you need to treat. Therefore, a suitable treatment is needed in order to treat the symptoms and the root cause of them.
Especially if you use them often, painkillers may fail to alleviate the pain, so we offer you some effective natural treatments to stop the pain. These are the 4 most common headache types:
Tension Headache
This is the most common headache type, and it causes pressure and a constant pain around the head, especially at the back of the head, neck, or the temples. Also, it can lead to a radiating pain below and above the eye area.
It is not a severe issue like a migraine, and it is not accompanied by vomiting and nausea. According to experts, it is a result of the contraction of neck and scalp muscles, due to stress.
Treatment: You will benefit a lot from the use of ginger tea, which will soothe inflammation. Moreover, you can add peppermint oil to the hairline, which will cause a cooling sensation which will soothe the pain in the neck and head. This combination will definitely treat the pain due to a tension headache.

2. Sinus Headache
This type of a headache occurs due to a sinus inflammation and causes great pain. The reasons are infections, often accompanied by a pressure around the eyes, forehead, and cheeks, and a fever.
Treatment: You should make sure your body is properly hydrated, so you should drink lots of fluids. Moreover, you can try to treat it with some warm soup, hot and cold compresses, or fresh ginger, which has potent pain-killing and anti-inflammatory properties.
Namely, warm water opens your sinuses and treats inflammation. Vitamin C is high in antioxidants and fights against, so you should consume foods and drinks rich in this vitamin, like oranges, lemon, or lemon green tea.
Migraine
This type of a headache affects over 38 million men, women, and children in the U.S. only. They usually occur between the ages of 25 and 55, but this does not mean that people from all ages can feel them.
This is not just a painful headache, but it is actually an extremely debilitating collection of neurological symptoms.
It causes a severe recurring and intense throbbing pain on one side of the head, as well as other signs, like dizziness, nausea, tingling or numbness in the face, visual disturbances, vomiting, extreme sensitivity to sound, touch, light, and smell.
The pain radiates from the top of the face downward.
Treatment: You will effectively treat the pain due to a migraine by using vitamin B12 (riboflavin), magnesium and omega-3 fatty acids. In order to prevent these attacks, you should maintain them on a healthy level in the body.
Furthermore, one study conducted in 2011 showed that aerobic exercise was as effective at preventing migraines as the preventative migraine medication topiramate, therefore, indicating that the regular exercise can replace medication and treat a migraine.
Cluster Headache
These headaches usually occur over one eye, and men are more susceptible to them than women. It is recurring, and can attack in a group or cycle.
It causes a severe, unbearable pain on one head side, and at times, even a runny nose, nasal congestion, and a watery eye. Its reason is still not known, but it occurs when an activation of a nerve pathway in the base of a brain takes place.
Treatment: The main ingredient of capsaicin cream is cayenne pepper, so you should apply a bit to the nostril, in order to block the nerve pain signals and thus treat pain.

"One of the major complaints about Snapchat over the years has been that it's too hard to use. As it struggles to grow its user base, CEO Evan Spiegel says he is finally acknowledging its detractors, and will redesign the app.
During the company's third-quarter earnings call to investors on Tuesday, Spiegel made the bombshell announcement, after detailing feedback that the app has been a tough nut to crack for a number of people.
“One thing that we have heard over the years is that Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use, and our team has been working on responding to this feedback,” Spiegel said on the call. “As a result, we are currently redesigning our application to make it easier to use.”
Spiegel added that Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, does not yet know what effects the changes will have on its user base.
""We don't yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application,"" he stated. ""We're willing to take that risk for what we believe are substantial long-term benefits to our business.""
Last quarter, Snapchat added just 4.5 million daily active users to bring its total to 178 million. By comparison, Facebook has 2.07 billion monthly active users and 1.37 billion daily active users. Instagram, which implemented some of Snapchat's most popular features including Stories, recently announced it surpassed 800 million monthly active users.
Spiegel's comments came on a conference call with industry analysts after the company posted the lackluster user-growth numbers and revenue that fell well short of Wall Street expectations. Snap's stock was bludgeoned Wednesday, falling 16 percent to $12.70 in early morning trading. The Venice, California, company went public in March at $17 a share.
Snapchat needs to grow its user base beyond 13 to 34 year olds in the U. S., France the U.K. and Australia, Spiegel said. This, he said, includes Android users, people older than 34 and what he called ""rest of world"" markets.
Meanwhile, Snap said Wednesday that Chinese internet company Tencent has acquired a 10 percent stake in the company. Tencent runs the WeChat messaging app, as well as online payment platforms and games. Earlier this year, Tencent bought a 5 percent stake in Tesla Inc.
MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN RAPE THAT VICTIM POSTED TO SNAPCHAT
Analysts are wary that the changes may cause some disruption to Snapchat's business, at least in the interim. In a note to investors, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said these changes ""may cause some short-term disruption to the business when consummated but we believe a long-term positive for the platform.""
Spiegel did not go into detail when the changes would be forthcoming, adding that it would be a ""surprise,"" but did add some context on how the app would look after the changes were implemented.
""As part of the redesign I mentioned earlier, we are going to make it easier to discover the vast quantity of content on our platform that goes undiscovered or unseen every day,"" Spiegel said. ""We think that there is a big opportunity to surface some of this content in a personalized and more relevant way, while still maintaining the exploratory nature of our service.""

Every person faces skin problems. However, the causes of their appearance are very difficult to define. They can be the result of a hormonal imbalance, nutrition or changes in lifestyle. You can find many medicines at the drugstore but these are full of chemicals which may harm your skin. Fortunately, traditional medicine contains a lot of recipes to get rid of moles, skin tags, warts, blackheads and age spots.
 Moles
Most of them are harmless. Moles appear through a natural process from the impact of the sun or genetics. How to make them less visible? Mix Baking soda and Castor Oil and apply it to the mole. Repeat it every night.  Warts Their appearance on the skin is usually associated with papilloma virus. Usually they point to certain problems with the immune system. How to get rid of them? Try apple cider vinegar, because it is very effective. All you have to do is to take a piece of cotton wool, steep it with vinegar and cover the wart in it the whole day using a plaster. If the vinegar does not suit you, do the same thing, but with garlic slices.
 Blackhead
The key to a pure skin is cleaning pores. How to get rid of them? The most effective way to do this is using facial scrub. All ingredients for a scrub you can find in your kitchen. Mix a tablespoon of sugar, a teaspoon of water and the juice of half a lemon together. It must look like wet sand. Use this as a scrub on your skin and rinse with warm water.  Skin tags These are a soft growth on the skin. How to get rid of them? The easiest way to get rid from them is to cut freeze or burn them off. A natural method is less painful. Tea tree oil and a few drops of water remove skin tags easily. Use this mixture on a cotton ball and put it on the skin tahg 3-4 times a day. You will notice the result in a month.  Age spots These appear due to direct sunlight, or simply due to the ageing of the skin. How to get rid of them? Rub them with lemon juice several times a day and they will disappear by themselves. Alternatively an Aloe Vera based cream must be applied for 20 minutes.

"Not even 24 hours has passed since the horrific attack in Las Vegas last night, but already things are on the move in the economy in response. Just like what has happened after many other mass shootings, the stocks of major firearms manufacturers’ is going up in response to the attack.
After the tragic attacks in Newtown, Connecticut, and Orlando, Florida, firearms sales skyrocketed. Especially after Newtown, there was a “panic-buy” where AR-style rifle prices went through the roof as supplies dwindled and manufacturers struggled to keep up with the demand. Americans were afraid of the government banning such long guns, and they want to get them while still feasible.
After this attack, the story is unfortunately the same. While we mourn those who have been killed and wounded, and show compassion on those who lost loved ones, at some point more Americans will begin to fear that the government will make possession or purchase of AR-style rifles either more difficult or more restricted.
Because of that, they buy more, and manufacturers’ stocks go up in value, asMarketWatchreports.
Smith & Wesson parent American Outdoor Brands Corp.’s stock AOBC, +3.48% jumped 3.8% in midday trade toward a three-week high, Sturm, Ruger & Co. Inc. shares RGR, +3.77% climbed 3.9% and Vista Outdoor Inc. shares VSTO, +2.35% ran up 3.0% toward a 6-week high.
Smith & Wesson parent American Outdoor Brands Corp.’s stock AOBC, +3.48% jumped 3.8% in midday trade toward a three-week high, Sturm, Ruger & Co. Inc. shares RGR, +3.77% climbed 3.9% and Vista Outdoor Inc. shares VSTO, +2.35% ran up 3.0% toward a 6-week high.
American Outdoor’s stock had tumbled 46% since the election through Friday, and closed at a 2 -year low of $13.31 as recently as Sept. 11. Sturm, Ruger shares had shed 20% since the election, and had also hit a roughly 2 -year low in September. Vista Outdoor’s stock, which hit a record low in April, had plunged 40% since the election.
For some perspective, the S&P 500 Index has increased 18% since the election last year. What that shows is that the firearms market demand had corrected since the election.
In the months leading up to November 2016, more guns were sold in each month than at any point in history. Each month broke a record in the number of firearms sales right up until November. Then Donald Trump won, and the hype died down. Things started to go back to normal demand levels, and stocks fell accordingly.
But this tragedy will affect the firearms market, especially given the incredibly breathtaking scope of the carnage. It’s truly difficult to comprehend such mass murder and chaos, and in the immediate aftermath people will have all sorts of emotional reactions to it.
The investigation is still ongoing, but already there is a market impact. If anything, that goes to show just how quickly our world moves today. In spite of this, let us not gloss over the horrendous nature of this as time goes on.",1
"For the pastry, put the flour and 5 tablespoons cold water in a freestanding mixer and knead with a dough hook. Alternatively knead by hand until the dough comes together. Add another tablespoon water if necessary. Knead until smooth then set aside to rest.
Place the butter between two pieces of baking paper. Hit it with a rolling pin to flatten, then roll out into a large square and place in the freezer.
On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough as thin and large as you can. Rest for 5 minutes in the fridge, then roll into a rectangle twice the size of the flattened butter.
Take the butter out of the paper and put on the dough. Bring the corners of the dough together to encase the butter. Roll out the pastry envelope on a floured surface to make a rectangle that is approximately three times longer than it is wide. Fold one third into the middle and then the other third on top. Seal the edges lightly using a rolling pin. Turn the dough 90 degrees, roll out and fold over again. Place the dough in the fridge while you make the caramelised onions.
For the caramelised onion, gently fry the onions over a low heat until soft. Add the salt, sugar, mustard and vinegar and cook until very soft. Set aside to cool.
Remove the pastry from the fridge and roll out and fold as before. Return to the fridge while you make the pickled cucumber.
For the pickled cucumber, peel half the cucumber and chop into 1cm/in cubes. Toss these in salt and leave for 20 minutes. Squeeze the cubes and mix with the sugar and vinegar. Chop the remaining cucumber into cubes and set aside.
Remove the pastry from the fridge and roll out and fold one final time. Chill for 10 minutes.
Roll the pastry into a large rectangle and spread with the cooled red onion mixture, reserving a little to serve. Roll up the pastry (like a Swiss roll) starting at a long side and keeping the roll as tight as possible. Slice into 1–2cm/–in-thick swirls.
Transfer to the baking tray, leaving room for the swirls to expand a little. Bake for 25–35 minutes until the pastry is risen and golden-brown.
Meanwhile, slice the goats’ cheese wheel into quarters, then slice the quarters into 5mm-thick slices. Place on a heatproof surface and use a chef’s blowtorch to lightly char them.",0
"Playgrounds and outdoor play equipment can provide your child with fun, fresh air and exercise, but they can also pose some safety hazards. Faulty equipment, improper surfaces, careless behavior and lack of adult supervision are just a few of the dangers that cause children on playgrounds to visit hospital emergency rooms.
You can make the playground a place that’s entertaining and safe for your child by checking equipment for potential hazards and following some simple safety guidelines. In addition, teaching your child how to play safely is important: kids who know the rules of the playground are less likely to get hurt.
A proper playground surface is one of the most important factors in reducing injuries – and the severity of injuries – that occur when kids fall from equipment. The surface under the playground equipment should be soft enough and thick enough to soften the impact of a child’s fall. Here are some things to consider:
* Concrete, asphalt and blacktop are unsafe and unacceptable. Grass, soil and packed-earth surfaces are also unsafe because weather and wear can reduce their capacity to cushion a child’s fall.
* The playground surface should be free of standing water and debris that could cause a child to trip and fall, such as rocks, tree stumps and tree roots.
* The surfaces may be loosely filled with materials like wood chips, mulch, sand, pea gravel or shredded rubber.
* Surfacing mats made of safety-tested rubber or rubber-like materials are also safe.
* Rubber mats and wood chips allow the best access for people in wheelchairs.
Whether your child plays on a home or public playground, it’s important that you take a general look at the equipment to make sure that it is clean and well maintained. All hardware on equipment should be secure, with no loose or broken parts. Plastic and wood should show no signs of weakening, and there should not be any splintered or rusted surfaces.
If the local playground has a sandbox, check for hazardous debris such as sharp sticks or broken glass, and be sure that the sand is free of bugs. Sandboxes should be covered overnight to prevent contamination from animals, such as cats.
Help keep your playground clean and safe by picking up trash, using the equipment properly, and reporting any problems to the city, town, or county parks department, school or other organization that is responsible for the upkeep of the playground. If a part seems broken, loose or in need of other maintenance, designate it off limits immediately and report the problem to the appropriate authorities.
The following types of equipment are not safe for playgrounds:
* glider swings that hold more than one child at a time
* swinging ropes that can fray, unravel or form a noose (any kind of rope attached to play equipment poses a strangulation hazard, so never let your child tie jump ropes or leashes onto the equipment)
* exercise rings (as used in gymnastics) and trapeze bars
Kids should know how to be safe and act responsibly at the playground. Here are some general rules to teach your child:
* Never push or roughhouse while on jungle gyms, slides, seesaws, swings and other equipment.
* Use equipment properly — slide feet first, don’t climb outside guardrails, no standing on swings, etc.
* If you jump off equipment, make sure that you check to make sure that there are no other children are in the way. When you jump, land on both feet with knees slightly bent.
* Leave bikes, backpacks and bags away from the equipment and the area where you’re playing so that no one trips over them and falls.
* Playground equipment should never be used if it is wet, because moisture causes the surface to be slippery.
* During the summertime, playground equipment can become uncomfortably or even dangerously hot, especially metal slides. So use good judgment — if the equipment feels hot to the touch, it’s probably not safe or fun to play on.
* Don’t wear clothes with drawstrings or other strings at the playground. Drawstrings, purses and necklaces could get caught on equipment and accidentally strangle a child.
* Wear sunscreen when playing outside even on cloudy days, so that you don’t get sunburned.
Play is an important part of kids’ physical, social, intellectual and emotional development. Following these safety tips will help your kids play as safely as possible.",0
"For folks who like to grow their own food or eat seasonally, springtime holds the promise of many new beginnings and upcoming harvests. But April and May can be somewhat desolate months when seeds are being put in ground but not many crops are actually ready to eat. Having parsnips overwinter provides a surprisingly luscious, seasonal treat that can be harvested before any other crops are ready to eat.
Spring-dug parsnips are coveted for their unique sweetness and depth of flavour. Instead of being harvested in the fall, these parsnips are left in the ground through the winter months and harvested as soon as the soil fully thaws. While they slumber under a bed of mulch and snow, the cold works its magic, converting their starches to sugar and turning them into a highly sought-after treat.
My friend Ume grows the most beautiful parsnips in her garden and she invited me to take part in her spring harvest last year. It was quite magical to spot the bright, promising roots against the cold dark earth. Ever since, I’ve had parsnips on the brain and have experimented with a whole bunch of parsnip recipes. Parsnip gnocchi has become a favourite. I’ve always loved classic potato gnocchi but when parsnip is added to the dough (I use half parsnip, half potato), the little white pillows take on an enticingly sweet flavour. I like to serve them with a lemony arugula walnut pesto. The tartness of the lemon, the spice of the arugula, and the saltiness of the parmesan all provide a balanced counterpoint to the sweet gnocchi. The whole thing is lip-smacking good.
A few words on gnocchi. It’s one of those things that intimidates people but it’s really not very hard to make. The trick with gnocchi is to avoid the gummy factor. Although I personally have always loved a chewy little gnocchi with some bite to it, once you’ve had a light and tender melt-in-your-mouth-gnocchi, it’s hard to go back.
I read up on how to make the most tender and light gnocchi and I find myself always going back to this article on Serious Eats. It’s incredibly informative and Daniel Gritzer offers up some great tips. Using dry, starchy potatoes such as Russets is key (though there are other equally starchy varieties, for the potato growers and connoisseurs out there). Baking them is recommended to get the maximum moisture out of the potato (though many traditional Italian recipes simply boil them, so  don’t think it actually matters THAT much). He also recommends using minimal flour (starting with 1/4 cup per pound of potato and working your way up if the dough needs it) and not overworking the dough because you don’t want to develop the gluten. He recommends using a pastry cutter to “cut” the flour in and then folding the dough on itself instead of kneading it. You’re supposed to use a “potato ricer” for gnocchi but I have a real aversion to specialized kitchen tools that end up sitting at the back of your drawer unused, so I refuse to buy one. But I had read that you can instead grate the baked potato using a box grater and I found it worked fairly well. Use the large holes, not the small ones as I did in the video (it will go quicker). The trick is that the potatoes should ideally still be hot, but if you’re grating them, just cooled enough to handle will do the trick. As for the parsnip, it isn’t nearly as finicky as the potatoes. I mashed it with a fork and it was fine, but if you can, puree it with a blender for smoother gnocchi dough. In large parsnips, the heart can be tough, so remove it if need be.
The instructions to my recipe are detailed, but don’t worry if you want to do things differently, there are a million ways to make a good gnocchi! Enjoy!

"LendUp, an online startup based in San Francisco, launched in late 2012 with a whole new model for a financial business. Pitching itself as something between a short-term lender and a credit-improvement service for people with bad or no credit history, it offered small-dollar loans on the promise that borrowers could improve their credit scores by paying them back on time and taking online financial education courses. Compliant borrowers would get progressively better terms on their loans, and eventually become eligible for LendUp to send their credit information and payment history to credit agencies.
At least, that’s how it was supposed to work. On Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau required LendUp’s parent company, Flurish, to pay $3.63 million, arguing that, among other infractions, LendUp collected data as borrowers repaid their loans but never delivered that information to agencies until February, 2014. California’s Department of Business Oversight order the company to pay an additional $2.79 million in a separate but concurrent settlement.
The CFPB’s enforcement action was its first against a new breed of lenders, known as financial technology lending startups, that are eager to blow up the stodgy old banking business, forging quick and easy connections with customers, and in the process re-imagining what the financial sector could look like. Consumers are flocking to lenders that promise quick mortgages over an iPhone; banks, intrigued, are looking at technology themselves, and in some cases partnering with the new firms to help them find clients.
As LendUp suggests, this fast-growing industry offers some intriguing new promises—and also poses totally new risks. Mingling credit improvement with small lending is a novel idea that really could work, and provides a service that under-served borrowers don’t get from either their local banks or predatory “payday lenders.” But it also opens the door for new kinds of trouble that you wouldn’t encounter at a bank. (LendUp bills itself as an alternative to payday lending, although its APRs can approach those of traditional payday lenders.) The company, which received a new round of $150 million in venture funding in January, says the CFPB complaint was based on problems from its early days in 2012 and 2013. “In those days we didn't have a fully built out compliance department,” the company said in an apologetic statement. “We should have.”
Online lending is just one corner of a whole new world of tech-driven financial businesses often lumped together under the shorthand term “fintech.” And as fintech grows, transforming lending, payments, and even money management, it's raising a huge question for Washington: how the nation's banking laws, which reach back decades or more, can keep up with a business changing so fast that even people who use it haven’t yet heard its name. “Most of the consumer protection fair credit laws were written in the 1970s, in the age of punch-card computers—and trying to apply them into a world of iPhone and wearable technology and Big Data is very challenging,” said Aaron Klein, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who previously worked in the Treasury Department. “There are serious gaps forming in how our consumer protection laws work.”
The total value of loans financed through online fintech lending range from $20 billion to nearly $40 billion in 2015, up from just a few billion dollars in 2013 and could hit $90 billion by 2020, according to one recent estimate. That would be a 300 percent increase in just five years. On the upside, experts think it has huge potential to make lending quicker and more open, making more money available to more people who need it. Lenders also say they’ll better be able to reach historically underserved borrowers—the type of customers who'd ordinarily turn to high-interest payday lenders. On the downside, consumer advocates and regulators are already warning that the unusual new structures of fintech companies could enable them to skirt the important rules that prevent discriminatory and unfair lending. They worry that algorithms could invisibly “redline” homeowners in the wrong neighborhoods; that small businesses could be hurt; and personal data restricted.
Complicating the problem, the regulators minding this store work in an alphabet soup of at least 10 federal agencies, along with another 50-plus state and territorial regulators and industry self-regulatory bodies. In an era when a man in Maine can quickly receive a $1,000 loan from a website like Lending Club through its bank affiliate in Utah, just determining who has jurisdiction over a transaction is challenging. It’s harder still for the thousands of fintech startups themselves, many of which are small and inexperienced in regulatory compliance and are looking for clarity. “It takes a lot of effort and resources to ensure compliance with a system that does provide that kind of a patchwork approach,” said Daniel Gorfine, associate general counsel at OnDeck, an online small-business lender.
For now, both sides are still in ""learn-and-grow"" mode: fintech itself, though expanding fast, remains just a small component of the overall lending industry. In 2015, the two largest online peer-to-peer lenders together originated just over $10 billion in consumer credit, compared with the $3.5 trillion consumer lending market. Regulators, for their part, are moving slowly and deliberately, asking questions and seeking input from interested parties before creating new rules. Even the most skeptical of consumer advocates remains optimistic that fintech will extend credit to historically underserved communities, ultimately helping minorities and boosting the economy. But those benefits will never develop without the proper safeguards in place. The question is how to structure them without suffocating a young industry in the process.
FOR ANYONE WHO'S been frustrated by the sclerotic banking system, fintech has the potential to be a godsend. People who aren't wealthy often lose valuable money and time on simple transactions like cashing checks; people of means have different headaches with payments and money management. Fintech promises to cut through all of that in different ways, revolutionizing how Americans interact with money and make their financial decisions. It has already made huge strides among the tech-savvy young, who use payment apps to transfer money among friends, and may live their lives without ever visiting a physical bank, or signing a check.
The fintech firms that have emerged in the past few years are basically stripping out the different function of big banks and offering them faster and more easily. The popular money site Mint.com offers users a simple tool to manage their money and set budgets. Payment companies like Venmo allow users to immediately transfer money between accounts instead of waiting days for checks to clear. For investors, so-called robo-advisors like Betterment are now competing with traditional financial advisers, while Digit allows its users to automatically save for retirement.
As they expand and proliferate, fintech companies are hitting a regulatory system built to supervise whole banks, not just their parts—and one that is already notorious for being complex and fragmented. Bank-holding companies are regulated by the Federal Reserve, but banks themselves are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or—in some cases—the Fed itself. Credit unions are yet another matter, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Federal Trade Commission and state regulators all have roles as well. And, since 2011, there's also the CFPB, the agency created to police the entire system on consumers' behalf. (Though the CFPB now sets all rules relating to consumer protection, enforcement is dispersed among numerous agencies.)
The explosion of new ideas plus a tangle of supervisors has left both sides uneasy, and observers are already foreseeing trouble. “The World Bank has a statistic out that by 2025, every adult in the world will have a bank account in their mobile phone,” said Jo Ann Barefoot, a senior fellow at Harvard University who studies fintech and was the deputy comptroller of the currency from 1978 to 1982. “That's a lot of change. The regulatory system is just not prepared for that even in the U. S., not prepared to guide that in a healthy direction and prevent disastrous problems at the same time.”
What are the hot spots? As fintech grows, a handful of areas of concern have emerged—holes where new firms can easily slip through existing safety nets. Three areas in particular have stood out: lending discrimination against consumers; disclosure requirements for small businesses, which tend to be vulnerable and in need of cash; and the sharing of consumer data – which fuels whole swaths of the industry, but is proving hard to manage well.
As Americans began buying billions of dollars worth of goods on credit in the 1950s and 1960s, driving a new and faster consumer economy, Congress realized lending was fraught with discrimination: mortgage lenders would often discount a wife’s earnings by 50 percent or more, for instance. In 1974, it passed the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits lenders from discriminating against borrowers on the basis of race, gender and other specified characteristics. In 1977, lawmakers passed the Community Reinvestment Act in response to rampant ""redlining"" against African-American families by mortgage lenders—the systematic denial of mortgages to certain geographic areas based on ethnicity. The CRA imposes an affirmative obligation on banks to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate.
While the Equal Credit Opportunity Act applies to all lenders, including those solely in the digital space, the CRA is more limited: it applies only to FDIC-insured banks, and looks at lending geographically, neighborhood by neighborhood. Online lenders, which aren’t insured by the FDIC, aren’t covered. They often use computer algorithms to make decisions, lessening the chance for biased case-by-case decisions—but raising the prospect, according to consumer advocates, of a “black box” problem in which de facto redlining occurs without any human intervention. “Just because we think it’s a computer making the decisions, doesn’t mean that there isn’t hidden bias,” said Jennifer Tescher, president of the Center for Financial Services and Innovation. “Because somewhere along the line a human had to write the code.”
Online lenders, for their part, dismiss these fears about data-driven discrimination, and stress that what they are doing isn’t exactly new: Lenders have long used models and different data sources to assess credit risk. Consumer advocates often cite the use of social media data in underwriting decisions as a cause for concern, such as using a person’s Facebook friends in a credit decision. But people at fintech companies say that consumer advocates have this wrong; that data, they said, are generally not used in the underwriting process, but instead are used for identity verification.
Consumer advocates believe there is an easy but politically challenging fix to these issues: Reform the Community Reinvestment Act so it applies to online lenders. In a speech in September, Thomas Curry, head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a key banking regulator, broached the idea. It delighted financial reformers; later this year, the OCC is expected to release its proposal for a special charter that allows fintech companies to operate nationally, without the need to partner with a bank or seek charters in every state, and the industry and advocates are both holding their breaths to see what it might include. As POLITICO’s Colin Wilhelm explains, the lobbying war is on for what types of rules will apply to fintechs under this new charter, and consumer advocates are pushing for that charter to include these strong anti-discrimination statutes. “That could be a game-changer,” said Klein of the Brookings Institution.
Traditionally, small businesses have fallen through the cracks of the financial system: Banks don’t like lending them money, since small commercial loans are just as costly to issue as big ones, but much less lucrative. So for capital, they fall back either on a personal credit card or a home equity line of credit. They may also turn to friends or family, or use their own savings.
Enter online lenders: Through automated underwriting and improved credit models, a new breed of tech-driven small-business lenders has emerged since the financial crisis offering small-dollar loans to small businesses. This development excited nearly everyone I spoke with. But almost everyone also agreed that a real gap exists in borrower protections if the borrower is a small business. Karen Mills, the former administrator of the Small Business Administration, and Brayden McCarthy, a former SBA staffer under Mills, pointed out in a much-discussed 2014 paper that many consumer protections don’t apply to small businesses. That includes the Truth in Lending Act, a 1968 law which requires creditors to disclose certain features of consumer credit.
The online small-business lending industry is clearly pocked with problems: A recent Federal Reserve survey found that online small-business lenders had a dismal satisfaction score, far below customers’ satisfaction with large banks, credit unions and small banks. Loan brokers are also increasingly becoming a problem in the small-business lending industry, McCarthy said; these middlemen find new borrowers, who often pay exorbitant fees, and may steer them to loans that are better for the broker than the cash-strapped small business. “We see them as a significant problem,” said Gina Harman, the head of Accion U. S. Network, a nonprofit focusing on improving financial inclusion that has worked with brokers.
Imposing new regulations on the brokerage industry will require an act of Congress. The same goes with extending the Truth in Lending Act to cover small-business lenders. But the CFPB has signaled it wants to improve our understanding of small business lending through Section 1071 of Dodd-Frank, under which the agency can require small-business lenders to collect loan data on women-owned and minority-owned businesses. The CFPB has yet to begin its formal rule-making process on that, but listed it in the spring as part of its upcoming agenda and already lenders are worried that the CFPB will not only collect the data but also use it for enforcement purposes. (When I mentioned that fear to McCarthy, he looked perplexed and said, “Well, I mean, that's the point of the data.”)
In May, the Treasury Department largely sided with consumer advocates when it proposed in a white paper to regulate small-business loans like consumer loans—treating the borrowers, who are often just single-person businesses, more like vulnerable individual consumers than sophisticated corporate clients. That possibility frightens lenders, who believe that small businesses are far more capable of understanding loan terms than individual consumers. Small-business lenders are also collaborating on private-sector efforts to improve transparency through a Small Business Borrowers’ Bill of Rights and other “disclosure boxes,” which allow consumers to easily compare loan products across online lenders.
In the coming years, the battle over the regulation of small-business lending will shift to Congress, where it’s unclear how things will shake out. McCarthy, now the vice president for strategy at Fundera, an online credit marketplace for small businesses, and Mills are set to release a new paper in early October which will contain policy recommendations for regulating online small-business lenders. Both are optimistic about the possibility for technology to pry open the once-forgotten market of small-business lending and deliver fast-turnaround loans with real transparency. Or, as Mills put it, “small-business utopia.”
One of the great potential benefits of fintech also carries its biggest risks: sharing data. Already, money-management tools like Mint are household names and help millions better track their finances. Others like Digit help consumers automatically save money. The accounting website Xero helps small businesses better manage their books. But all of these new products depend on having access to their customers’ financial data. “I can’t stress enough how important it is for not only Xero but for the industry as a whole,” said Ryan Himmel, who joined Xero earlier this year to establish relationships with financial institutions. But right now, the process for consumers and small businesses to share their data with third parties can be cumbersome and even insecure.
Most fintech companies connect to a user’s bank account to retrieve their real-time financial data. They often do so by a surprisingly crude mechanism called “screen-scraping”—literally logging into the user’s bank account and collecting the data displayed on the screen. Far preferable would be a more direct connection through an application programming interface (API) which allows for real-time data transmission. Everyone agrees screen-scraping is an insecure process for transmitting financial data. However, banks claiming security concerns have been slow to allow consumers to share their data with third parties over APIs. This has angered consumer advocates, who believe that data is rightfully owned by the consumers and that banks should have no authority to act as a gatekeeper. “We definitely think the consumer ought to be in control of their information,” said Gerron Levi, the director for policy and government affairs at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.
However, simply requiring banks to allow consumers to share their data with any third party carries significant liabilities for the bank. If a consumer shares their data with a third party that is hacked and the hacker uses that data in a nefarious way, who is liable? That question has yet to be answered, but everyone I spoke with agreed that banks would likely be at fault. It’s not hard to see why they’d resist opening their systems via an API. “Right now, one could interpret the rules as saying that since these are all third-party providers to banks that banks have the liability all the way through the chain,” said Tescher. Banks are also nervous about sharing their customers’ confidential information.
“First and foremost, the banks’ responsibility is to their customer to keep their funds and personally identifiable information safe,” said Rob Morgan, vice president for emerging technologies at the American Bankers Association. “Any move they do towards this has to be very carefully thought out. If you think of startups, the model is move fast and break things. Frankly, that’s not what I want from my bank.”
There's one agency that does have the authority to force banks to grant consumers access to their financial information: The CFPB, which is empowered by Dodd-Frank to require banks to give consumers access to information on their use of financial products and services, including transaction, account data and usage information. Whether this means the agency can literally force banks to move to an open API system isn't clear: experts I spoke to for the story were uncertain, and the Bureau declined to comment.
If the agency does force banks' hand, the U. S. will still be behind Britain, where financial regulators are already implementing such a policy. It could have wide benefits, ensuring everyone is using the same technology and won't have to negotiate individual agreements between every two firms that want to share data. But experts also said that the U.S. financial system is far more complex than Britain’s and cautioned that a top-down regulatory approach could prove equally, if not more, damaging for the nascent industry.
“The choice that we face is who will be at the table as a standard for access to account-level information is drafted,” said Thomas Brown, a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings. “Will it be drafted in closed sessions by financial institutions for financial institutions? Or will it be developed with additional constituents at the table including developers, consumer groups and regulators?”
THOUGH MANY OF these arguments are taking place behind closed doors, there are signs that Washington is starting to pay more public attention. In March, the OCC put out an 11-page paper on responsible innovation and asked for comments; in May, the Treasury Department published its own 39-page white paper on online lending. The CFPB's Project Catalyst is earning high marks among fintech firms for engaging with the private sector and supporting innovation. The FTC, White House and OCC all held events—some public, some private—on the issue as well, inviting leading experts and innovators to talk about fintech regulation.
In Congress, Rep. Patrick McHenry has been speaking frequently about the industry. And Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jeff Merkley sent a letter in July to the top banking regulators demanding to know how they were addressing the changes in the financial industry—though the letter was chiefly a demand to know what, if anything, was going on.
Few industries welcome the government sniffing around, and indeed some fintech companies are nervous about the potential for new burdensome regulations. But they're also eager for some kind of regulatory clarity. The patchwork nature of financial regulations—a system built over decades to handle big institutional players with a wide mix of banking practices—has been a major challenge to the growth of an industry trying to move at the speed of tech.
“There is a lot of talk to what extent are we going to be regulated,” said Richard Neiman, head of government affairs at Lending Club. “I’d say the current and future regulatory landscape is a net positive for the industry.”
Everyone involved in the fintech world is genuinely excited about its possibilities. Americans can save more money and make more responsible financial decisions. Small businesses can have better access to credit, allowing them to grow and spurring more economic growth. Consumers can get loans quickly without having to go to a high-cost payday lender. The potential benefits are numerous—but they will happen only if policymakers construct the right safeguards to protect consumers and borrowers while not imposing regulations that are too costly for companies. It’s the age-old regulatory problem of finding the right balance. Given the fragmented financial regulatory system that exists right now, many doubt that it is capable of addressing these new challenges in a positive manner.
“We've been trying for decades, for like 40 or 50 years, to promote financial protection and financial inclusion through regulation,” said Barefoot, the senior fellow at Harvard. “And it hasn't worked very well. Suddenly, we have technology that can accomplish both on a scale we never could have imagined — but it will only happen if we regulate it well.”",0
"Fifa is set to lift the ban on displaying the poppy after talks with football associations in the UK.
Last year, football's world governing body fined England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for their use of the poppy to commemorate Armistice day, deeming it to be a political symbol.
England and Scotland wore the emblem on black armbands during their World Cup qualifier at Wembley last November.
Wales and Northern Ireland were fined for displaying it in their stadiums.
The ensuing row drew criticism from the Prime Minister, with Theresa May calling Fifa's stance ""utterly outrageous"".
""Our football players want to recognise and respect those who have given their lives for our safety and security,"" she said. ""I think it is absolutely right that they should be able to do so.""
Last week Fifa is understood to have sent out a draft proposal to its member nations with revised provisions that could see the poppy permitted if opposing teams and the competition organiser for the relevant match both accept its use in advance.
The new law is expected to be passed in time for November's international games, which are to be played between 6 and 14 November - a period that incorporates Remembrance weekend.
England are set to play Germany in a friendly at Wembley during this time and it is understood the German FA has no objections over the use of the poppy.
England players are now expected to either wear armbands with a poppy on them or have the poppy embroidered on their shirts in the same way as Premier League teams.
The match will be given the go-ahead provided both countries avoid the World Cup play-offs. To do so, England need to beat Slovenia at Wembley next month to secure automatic promotion while a draw is enough for Germany against Northern Ireland at Windsor Park.
The FA declined to comment until the decision to change the game's laws has been fully ratified.
Sports Minister Tracey Crouch said she was pleased that ""Fifa is finally going to apply common sense and change its position on poppies"".
Last year, England and Scotland displayed the poppy on a black armband in an unsuccessful attempt to circumvent the regulations.
That echoed similar actions in 2011 when, under now-departed leadership, Fifa permitted England, Scotland and Wales to use armbands.
The new wording of Fifa's law tightens the definition of what is deemed a 'political' symbol prohibiting:
* the commemoration of any living or dead person
* any group whose aims / actions would offend a notable number of people
The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the guardian organisation of the sport's laws, is expected to approve the amendment in early October.
The issue looked likely to be pursued in the courts at one stage after Fifa sanctioned the UK's football associations for using the poppy late last year.
Instead, with the prospect of increased fines being levied for repeat offences, negotiations have taken place to find a solution.
The emphasis will now be on competition organisers, such as Uefa and Fifa, to determine if a particular symbol is 'political' under the new regulation.
It is believed the fines levied against the UK associations last year will not now need to be paid.",0
"Have you ever been pressurised into buying something you didn't want by a highly persuasive salesperson? Perhaps a phone call from someone trying to sell you double glazing, a home visit from a sales representative offering to pave your drive or a letter inviting you to a timeshare presentation.
If so, be sure not to act in haste because you can't usually change your mind once you've signed on the dotted line. The law gives you a cooling off period only in limited circumstances, so a snap decision could be costly and inconvenient leaving you with something you don't really need.
Concerns about aggressive selling techniques used by some timeshare firms led to the introduction of the  Timeshare Act 1992. Under the legislation you have a 14-day cooling off period if you sign a timeshare contract in the UK, which means you can cancel the contract at any time within that period and get your money back.
Moreover, you must be told of your right to cancel and receive a cancellation form before you enter into the deal. If the salesperson doesn't notify you of your right to cancel, the cancellation period is extended indefinitely.
If you are duped into buying a timeshare while on holiday you would normally get a 10-day cooling off period. But as a general rule, if you are unsure about anything it is best not to sign a contract while on holiday - wait until you get home so you can seek legal advice.
You should also be wary of huge discounts and bear in mind that promotions that are available ""today only"" are likely to be available every day. You may also be offered a prize or gift to persuade you to attend a timeshare presentation where you may be placed under a lot of pressure to sign on the spot. Unless you've looked into what is on offer and are seriously considering buying from that company, don't even attend in the first place.
Also beware of a new product similar to timeshares known as Holiday Clubs. They are not covered by the Timeshare Act so you do not have an automatic right to a cooling off period. The Office of Fair Trading has warned consumers against signing a Holiday Club deal unless they are sure it is exactly what they want.
Doorstepper stress
Doorstep salespeople have a reputation for using high pressure selling techniques to persuade people to buy things they don't want and can't afford. If you get such a call from someone selling double glazing windows, for example, don't sign a contract or part with any money. It's best to take a copy of the agreement and study the small print before you proceed.
The  Doorstep Selling Regulations 1987 give you the right to a seven day cooling off period if you sign a contract to buy goods or services for 35 or more after an unsolicited visit to your home from a salesperson.
The same rights also apply if the sales visit follows an unsolicited phone call from a trader.
Doorstep sellers must inform you of your right to a cooling off period or they are committing a criminal offence. You must exercise your right to cancel in writing within seven days. If this is sent by post it will take effect on posting. Once you've cancelled you are entitled to get back any money you have paid, and the cancelled contract is treated as if it was never made.
The government is so concerned about dubious selling tactics that it is proposing to provide consumers with a seven day cooling off period if they sign agreements at home after receiving a solicited visit from a trader.
These proposals are enshrined in the consumers, estate agents and redress bill, which is currently at the committee stage and expected to become law soon.
Don't call, don't write
In general, telephone cold calling is not illegal so traders can make unsolicited calls without breaking any laws. But if you register with the  Telephone Preference Service you can prevent unsolicited sales calls.
Once you have done this it is unlawful for a trader to contact you without your permission. Similarly, if you get a lot of junk mail you avoid much of it by registering with the  Mailing Preference Service. However, this service applies only to personally addressed mail - you may still get mail addressed to the occupier.
When you receive goods you have not ordered they are known as unsolicited goods. If a trader demands payment for them they are commiting a criminal offence under the  Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971.
You are entitled to keep the goods as your own. If you received the goods before November 1 2000, however, you must give notice to the sender to collect them within 30 days, or otherwise wait for six months before they become yours to keep.",0
"Written by Allyssia Alleyne, CNN
Italian luxury brand Gucci is officially going fur-free, president and CEO Marco Bizzarri announced on Wednesday.
""Being socially responsible is one of Gucci's core values, and we will continue to strive to do better for the environment and animals,"" Bizzari said at a London College of Fashion event.
""With the help of HSUS (Humane Society of the United States) and LAV (an Italian animal rights organization), Gucci is excited to take this next step and hopes it will help inspire innovation and raise awareness, changing the luxury fashion industry for the better.""
Under the new policy, Gucci will not use mink, coyote, raccoon dog, fox or any other animal bred or caught for their fur. The brand's Spring-Summer 2018 collection, which was shown at Milan Fashion Week in September and will go on sale next year, will be its first without fur. Remaining fur items will be sold in a charity auction.

""Gucci going fur-free is a huge game-changer. For this Italian powerhouse to end the use of fur because of the cruelty involved will have a huge ripple effect throughout the world of fashion,"" Humane Society International president Kitty Block said in a statement.
""We commend Gucci's compassionate decision, and for helping to ensure that the future of fashion is fur-free.""

Gucci is not the only brand to forgo the use of fur. In 2016, Italian designer Giorgio Armani announced his brands would end their use of fur, ""reflecting our attention to the critical issues of protecting and caring for the environment and animals."" Vivienne Westwood, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren are also fur-free.
In recent seasons, many brands have embraced fake fur, with the real deal increasingly seen as unfashionable.
""Real fur is extraordinarily old-fashioned,"" Stella McCartney, whose own brand is fully vegetarian, told CNN in 2015. ""Even if you're 20 and you've got a real fur coat, you just look like an old, unaware, unconscious being on the planet.
""It's not relevant, it's not sexy, it's not fashionable, and it's not cool.""",0
"In the middle of 2014, the world finally got a look at how brokers and hedge funds manipulate the stock markets through High Frequency Trading (HFT) computers that see every trade before it happens, and can submit billions of trades before the regular investor’s request is filled. The outlay of this fraud was described in the fictional novel by Michael Lewis titled, Flash Boys, and led to a full blown propaganda campaign by brokers and the mainstream media to discredit Lewis’s assertion that the entire market is rigged.
But within all of this were the traders who actually knew for a long time that computer algorithms were at the top of the market food chain, and one trader in particular,Nav Sarao, not only learned how to analyze these algo’s but he also discovered how to use them to profit on his own by following their trends and patterns.
Which of course is why the CFTC on April 21 decided to indict the foreign national who dared profit from their own fraudulent mechanisms and attempt to make him the scapegoat to turn the public’s eye away from the real wizard behind the curtain.
As we first observed yesterday, the real reason Nav was picked as a scapegoat is because he threatened to expose the “mass manipulation of high frequency nerds.” This was validated last night when Bloomberg reported that “the sleuth who pieced together Navinder Singh Sarao’s pattern of spoofing isn’t an FBI agent or regulator. He’s an academic whose research has taken the view that high-frequency trading is good for markets.” Hence, Sarao is bad for the HFTs and should be “eliminated.”
Today, we find precisely how and why Sarao was singled out: he not only exposed out the parasitic trading strategies of the real culprits behind the broken market, the massive HFT firms (such as Virtu which went public 24 hours before the Sarao charges were filed) which gave the “regulators” no choice: one of them had to be put away for good, but found a way to capitalize on the algos’ stupidity, and actually make money by beating them at their own game. – Zerohedge
Wall Street has evolved into a market for the elite, where commercial brokers now bet as much against their clients and customers as they do for them. And the advent of HFT systems has made it where markets can not only be easily manipulated up or down dependent upon the whims of the algorithms, but the new phenomenon of ‘flash crashes’ can wipe out retail investors when these computer programs get out of control, and send billions of trades in one direction in less than a second.
Like with Bernie Madoff and his long time ponzi scheme, the Department of Justice and other U. S. financial regulators always look for individual scapegoats to indict, arrest, and make into a public spectacle to mask the fact that the real criminals and perpetrators work at institutions like J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and HSBC. And while no banker from any of these firms has been indicted, arrested, or held beyond bread and circus’s hearings on the floors of Congress, if you are not part of the elite cabal, traders like Nav Sarao are not allowed to make money in the markets doing the same thing the big boys do.

"Although I’ve been aware of the recent positive feedback of cannabis oil to various serious diseases, I was still skeptical to consider this as a viable solution for certain health disorders. After all, so many people these days are looking for the perfect miracle pill to solve their health issues!
Was this another panacea? Was this another way of buying into the one size fits all treatments that come into the bottle, without being necessary to make any dietary and life style changes? Well, in the end, it all depends on how we really make use of these extracts that Nature provided us and how clearly we see the “big picture” of true healing. So it was time to find out more! I interviewed one of my colleagues with extensive knowledge on the matter –Steven Sinay, a fellow Metabolic Typing practitioner, as well as VP of Nutritional Science for Empower Genetics,and below is what he kindly shared with me regarding this interesting topic:
Raluca Schachter: What is cannabis oil more specifically and how does it work?
Steven Sinay: Cannabis Oil is a thick, sticky, resinous substance that is extracted from the cannabis plant (Cannabis sativaor Cannabis indica). Cannabis oil is a base product that is prepared by separating the resins from the cannabis flowers (buds) using a solvent extraction process. Cannabis oil contains several Cannabinoids including Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component, and Cannabidiol (CBD), the medicinal component of cannabis.
For legal purposes becoming more commonly used over Cannabis oil, is Hemp oil which is being grown in Europe to have higher levels of CBD and with no THC. In 2001, the DEAissueda rule banning all import and cultivation of industrial grade hemp. In 2003, theHemp Industries Associationfiled anUrgent Motion for Stayin theNinth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court sided with the Hemp Industries Association.
In the decision, Judge Betty Fletcherwrote,“[T]hey (DEA) cannot regulate naturally occurring THC not contained within or derived from marijuana-i.e., non-psychoactive hemp is not included in Schedule I. The DEA has no authority to regulate drugs that are not scheduled, and it has not followed procedures required to schedule a substance. The DEA’s definition of “THC” contravenes the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and cannot be upheld.”
Judge Fletcher is essentially saying that the DEA cannot regulate hemp or the chemicals within it because hemp contains no THC, is not marijuana, and is therefore not covered underthe controlled substances act; and the DEA cannot regulate substances that have not been scheduled. This is why you can purchase and sell CBD hemp oil.
Over the last 20 years Cannabis has been at the center of one of the most exciting and underreported developments in recent modern science. Research on marijuana’s effects led directly to the discovery of an unknown biochemical communication system in the human body, the Endocannabinoid System, which plays a crucial role in regulating our physiology, mood, and everyday experience.
The discovery of receptors in the brain that respond pharmacologically to Cannabis and the subsequent identification of endogenous cannabinoid compounds in our own bodies that bind to these receptors has significantly advanced our understanding of human biology, health, and disease.
It is an established scientific fact that cannabinoids and other components of cannabis can modulate many physiological systems in the human brain and body. Cannabinoids are chemical compounds that trigger cannabinoid and other receptors. More than 100 cannabinoids have been identified in the marijuana plant. Of these, THC and CBD have been studied most extensively. In addition to cannabinoids produced by the plant, there are endogenous cannabinoids (anandamide and 2AG) that occur naturally in the body, as well as synthetic cannabinoids created by pharmaceutical researchers.
Cannabinoids promote homeostasis at every level of biological life, from the sub-cellular, to the organism, and perhaps to the community and beyond. Here’s one example: autophagy, a process in which a cell sequesters part of its contents to be self-digested and recycled, is mediated by the cannabinoid system. While this process keeps normal cells alive, allowing them to maintain a balance between the synthesis, degradation, and subsequent recycling of cellular products, it has a deadly effect on malignant tumor cells, causing them to consume themselves in a programmed cellular suicide. The death of cancer cells, of course, promotes homeostasis and survival at the level of the entire organism.
Scientists associated with the International Cannabinoid Research Society (ICRS) have elucidated a number of molecular pathways whereby CBD exerts a therapeutic impact. A preclinical study by Dr. Sean McAllister and his colleagues at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco reports on how CBD kills breast cancer by down regulating a gene called ID-1, which is implicated in several types of aggressive cancer. Silencing the ID-1 gene is thus is an excellent strategy for a cancer treatment.
Extensive preclinical research much of it sponsored by the U. S. Government (see U.S. Patent below) indicates that CBD has potent anti-tumoral, antioxidant, anti-spasmodic, anti-psychotic, anti-convulsive, and neuroprotective properties. CBD directly activates serotonin receptors, causing an anti-depressant effect, as well.
The United States Government holds U. S. Patent 6,630,507 (filed 1999) on Cannabinoids stating in their patent: “Cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties, unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found property makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and HIV dementia. Nonpsychoactive cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, are particularly advantageous to use because they avoid toxicity that is encountered with psychoactive cannabinoids at high doses useful in the method of the present invention.”
Raluca Schachter: With what conditions has cannabis oil proved to be most successful?
Steven Sinay:According to many CBD Researchers the following are a list of conditions that the use of CBD has been shown to improve: Acne, ADD/ADHD, Addiction, AIDS, ALS, Alzheimer’s Disease, Anorexia, Antibiotic Resistance, Anxiety, Atherosclerosis, Arthritis, Asthma, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Cancer, Colitis/Crohn’s, Depression, Diabetes, Endocrine Disorders, Epilepsy/Seizure, Fibromyalgia, Glaucoma, Heart Disease, Huntington’s Disease, Inflammatory Disorders, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, Metabolic Syndrome, Migraines, Mood Disorders, Motion Sickness, Multiple Sclerosis, Nausea, Neurodegeneration, Neuropathic Pain, Obesity, OCD, Osteoporosis, Parkinson’s Disease, Prion/Mad Cow Disease, PTSD, Rheumatism, Schizophrenia, Sickle Cell Anemia, Skin Conditions, Sleep Disorders, Spinal Cord Injury, and Stress Stroke/TBI.
Raluca Schachter: What should we look for in terms of quality when we choose cannabis oil?
Steven Sinay:Since cannabis oil products have only been in the market place for a short period of time, it is important to source these products just as you would your produce, meat, fish, etc. As far as I can tell there are not a lot of regulatory organizations monitoring the quality and purity of these sources. Be sure to look for a product that has gone through some sort of third party lab testing that detect contaminants like pesticides, fungicides, mycotoxins, microbes, etc. Equally as important consumers need to be aware of the concentration of their medicinal cannabis. It is fundamental in allowing the consumer to choose the correct medicine for their symptoms, as well as determining the proper dose. It’s good practice to find a manufacturer that is not afraid to allow access to each Certificate of Analysis on every batch they produce.
Raluca Schachter: In what countries can cannabis oil be bought, legally speaking?
Steven Sinay:As long as the CBD oil product is purchased from a non THC Hemp oil source it should be legal in all countries. Here in the United States a non THC CBD product is classified as a dietary supplement and is legal in all 50 states.
Raluca Schachter: The nutritional world is quite flooded with hypes these days. But as we know through Metabolic Typing, there is no nutrient, remedy or food that can be beneficial for everybody. Any nutrient has different effects in different metabolisms, biochemically speaking. So there are no one size fits all remedies, really. From your experience, have you had the chance to observe how this remedy had different effects in different metabolisms?
Steven Sinay: As previously mentioned, at the right dosage, CBD has been shown to significantly help with anxiety, pain, neurodegeneration, inflammation, etc. An appropriately high dosage of CBD will give you all the desired effects you need, and there is really no risk of overdose as CBD is harmless even in high concentrations. However, most people will feel little effect if they take too low a dosage, effectively wasting CBD’s powerful beneficial properties.
With the above in mind, the importance of correct CBD dosage becomes obvious. People with different requirements and different metabolisms will need accordingly different CBD dosages to experience CBD’s positive effects, and dosages can vary dramatically because there is no one-size-fits-all “typical CBD dosage.” While there is no such thing as “too much CBD,” you can in fact take too little to feel a difference. Dosage can range anywhere from 2-3 mg, up to 100 mg, 200 mg, or 500 mg to 1000 mg on the super high end. Remember, you cannot overdose and there are no reported side effects from taking high concentrations of CBD. Most people only need around 2-3 mg per day to start feeling a difference. Yet people with stronger needs may need to start at a lower dose and work their way up until they find the right dose for their body.
Raluca Schachter: What are your thoughts regarding the future of cannabis in the medical field?
Steven Sinay:This is the $64,000 Dollar Question! With our government holding a patent on several Cannabinoids, it leads one to be a little skeptical. Why? The forces that would keep cannabis illegal are vocal and very well-funded, but they are not impervious to persistent effort. The lynch pin in the War on Drugs has always been cannabis. Without the suppression and interdiction of this popular and widely used substance, there simply would not be enough “illegal drug use” going on to justify the huge amount of money and resources spent on “fighting drugs.” Once again all based on the all mighty dollar!
I feel CBD and other Cannabinoids with the persistence from those who can, and are truly benefiting from its medicinal properties, along with natural healers promoting its use, will find its place in future modern medicine. Time will tell.",1

Hillary Clinton goes on the record about Harvey Weinstein - and his donations to Democrats
Liberal actress Meryl Streep used her time at the podium after winning the Golden Globes Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award to rip Republican President-elect Donald Trump — though she never mentioned his name in her speech.
“There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good. There was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter,” Streep said Sunday night, presumably in reference to Trump’s apparent mocking ofSerge Kovaleski, who has a congenital condition that affects joint movement. “Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it. I still can’t get it out of my head because it wasn’t in a movie. It was real life.”
Streep added that “this instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, ’cause it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.”
Interestingly, while Streep dedicated a major portion of her time behind the mic to call out Trump, she also said “an actor’s only job is to enter the lives of people who are different from us and let you feel what that feels like.”
Streep also asked the media “to hold power to account, to call them on the carpet for every outrage. That’s why our founders enshrined the press and its freedoms in our Constitution.”
Here’s the full transcript of Streep’s speech, via Consequence of Sound:
Thank you very much. Thank you. Please sit down. Please sit down. Thank you. I love you all. You’ll have to forgive me. I’ve lost my voice in screaming and lamentation this weekend. And I have lost my mind sometime earlier this year. So I have to read.
Thank you, Hollywood foreign press. Just to pick up on what Hugh Laurie said. You and all of us in this room, really, belong to the most vilified segments in American society right now. Think about it. Hollywood, foreigners and the press. But who are we, and what is Hollywood, anyway? It’s just a bunch of people from other places. I was born and raised and educated in the public schools of New Jersey. Viola was born in a sharecropper’s cabin in South Carolina, came up in Central Falls, Rhode Island. Sarah Paulson was born in Florida and raised by a single mom in Brooklyn.
Sarah Jessica Parker was one of seven or eight kids from Ohio. Amy Adams was born in Vicenza, Italy, and Natalie Portman was born in Jerusalem — where are their birth certificates? And the beautiful Ruth Negga was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, raised in — no, in Ireland, I do believe, and she’s here, nominated for playing a small-town girl from Virginia. Ryan Gosling, like all the nicest people, is Canadian. And Dev Patel was born in Kenya, raised in London, is here for playing an Indian raised in Tasmania. So Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners. And if we kick ’em all out, you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.
They gave me three seconds to say this, so. An actor’s only job is to enter the lives of people who are different from us and let you feel what that feels like. And there were many, many, many powerful performances this year that did exactly that, breathtaking, compassionate work. There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good. There was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it. I still can’t get it out of my head because it wasn’t in a movie. It was real life.
And this instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, ’cause it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing.
Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose. Okay. Go on with that thing.
This brings me to the press. We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call them on the carpet for every outrage. That’s why our founders enshrined the press and its freedoms in our Constitution. So I only ask the famously well-heeled Hollywood foreign press and all of us in our community to join me in supporting the Committee to Protect Journalists, because we’re going to need them going forward, and they’ll need us to safeguard the truth.
One more thing. Once when I was standing around on the set one day whining about something, we were going to work through supper, or the long hours or whatever, Tommy Lee Jones said to me, “Isn’t it such a privilege, Meryl, just to be an actor?” Yeah, it is. And we have to remind each other of the privilege and the responsibility of the act of empathy. We should all be very proud of the work Hollywood honors here tonight. As my friend the dear departed Princess Leia said to me once, “Take your broken heart, make it into art.”

"Unveiled at Art Basel in Miami in November, it was tearing up the track in Daytona in January: The BMW M6 painted by renowned artist John Baldessari is a high-performance racing machine. As BMW Motorsport's director put it, ""On the outside, it's a piece of art. But on the inside it wants to go out today and wants to win.""
It's the 19th in BMW's Art Car series. Inaugurated in 1975, it was the idea of Herve Poulain, a racing enthusiast and art lover, who persuaded Alexander Calder to paint the German automaker's entry at Le Mans that year.
Then, says BMW's Thomas Girst, it just took off: ""It was supposed to be a one-off at the very beginning with Alexander Calder. But the moment this car left the pit stop, with the kids were screaming, it became the immediate darling of the crowd that was watching.""
The next year, Frank Stella created his ""graph paper"" BMW. In 1977, Roy Lichtenstein's car looked like a comic strip.
The fourth Art Car is the most famous. Painted by Andy Warhol in 1979, it's now considered the most valuable car in BMW history.
African artist Esther Mahlangu was the first woman to paint a BMW in 1991.
British artist David Hockney painted a dachshund on the back panel, because his own dogs always rode with him.
Jeff Koons was the last to paint a car, in 2010 -- until John Baldessari got the commission.
He'd never painted a car before: ""No, that was the challenge,"" he said.
At 85, Baldessari is a towering figure in the art world , and not just because he's 6'7"". The celebrated California conceptual artist has been called ""a surrealist for the digital age."" Baldessari once instructed a class to write ""I will not make any more boring art"" over and over.
""I always said, art is what you can get away with,"" he told Mason.
""Sunday Morning"" visited Baldessari at his Los Angeles studio, where he displays a fan letter from Scarlett Johansson. (He's a fan of hers, too.)
Baldessari started turning old film stills to art in the 1970s. ""I could get 'em very cheap … 10 cents a piece. Yeah, you can't go wrong with 10 cents a piece.""
Then one day he put pricing stickers over the faces, and painted them primary colors, to make them ""ordinary.""
Baldessari built it into his design for the BMW, putting a giant red dot on the roof. ""That's so you could be seen from the air. That's my ego!""
He put an image of the M6 on one side, and the word ""Fast"" on the other.
And, said BMW's Thomas Girst, ""It will go fast, we promise you that.""
But John Baldessari hasn't driven in his signature BMW. ""I can't even fit in it,"" he said. ""I'm just too big.""
Mason asked, ""How do you feel the car turned out?""
""I'm very proud of it,"" he replied.
He should be: Art that travels 130 mph is anything but boring.",0
"Q. My new iPhone does not have a little globe key on the keyboard like I’ve seen on other people’s Apple phones. Mine just has the “happy face” key. Why is this?
A. Along with the smiling face and other emoji pictographs, the iPhone can display keyboard layouts for dozens of languages. When you add a new international keyboard, the “happy face” key used to insert emoji characters into text changes to the globe key. When you press and hold the globe key, a menu pops up to display your alternate keyboard choices — including emoji.
If you would like to add a keyboard designed for use with another language, you can do so in the iPhone’s keyboard settings. Tap open the Settings icon on the home screen, select General and then go to Keyboard. Then go to Keyboards and select Add New Keyboard. On the Add New Keyboard screen, scroll through the list and tap the language you want to use. (If you are using the keyboard in an app, you can also go right to the settings by pressing and holding the emoji key for a few seconds until a menu pops up with an option for Keyboard Settings.)
When you return to using the iPhone keyboard in the Mail, the Notes or another text-heavy app, you should now see the globe key on the keyboard. Press and hold the globe icon for a second or two until the list of keyboards appears — like the emoji set or the international keyboard you just added.
In addition to the Keyboard Settings shortcut (where you can adjust your preferences for auto-correction, predictive text and other typing-related tools), the pop-up menu includes icons you can use to switch to the “one-handed” keyboard that is part of iOS 11. When you select either the left- or the right-handed layout, the essential keys slide over to your chosen side of the screen to make typing with your thumb easier.

"Q. I’ve switched to using my phone’s mobile hotspot to connect my laptop to the Internet. How do I make sure I don’t exceed the 10-gigabyte cap on that feature?
A. Four years ago, this would have been courting disaster. But now that the four big nationwide carriers all sell “unlimited” plans with much more generous quotas on mobile-hotspot use, sharing your phone’s connection with a laptop or desktop won’t necessarily doom you.
But you can still find yourself limited to painfully slow connections that may force you to trek to the nearest open WiFi hotspot.
At AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile, their unlimited plans—more accurately called unmetered plans—limit hotspot use to 10 gigabytes. Exceed that cap, and “tethering” slows, sometimes to a painful degree.
AT&T caps hotspot use past 10 GB to 128 kbps, while Sprint chokes it to 32 kbps (or you can buy extra full-speed use at $15 a gig). T-Mobile and Verizon only say you’ll be throttled back to 3G speeds, which the research firm OpenSignal reported earlier this year averaged 4 Mbps at T-Mo and 0.85 Mbps at VzW.
Note that in T-Mobile’s normal unlimited plan, hotspot use never exceeds 3G speeds. To get LTE tethering, you need to pay $5 a month more for its T-Mobile One Plus add-on.
Your phone will report how much data you’ve sacrificed for hotspot use in its Settings app: In iOS, tap the Cellular heading; in Android, tap Data Usage and then “Cellular data usage.” But this information is more useful on the tethered computer, where you’re actually using that data.
Windows includes a feature in Windows 8 and 10 for this exact scenario: a “Metered Connection” option you can set for specific WiFi networks. To use this in Win 10, open the Settings app, select Network & Internet, choose Wi-Fi, choose “Manage known networks,” pick your phone’s hotspot, select Properties and enable “Set as metered connection.”
After you set your carrier’s hotspot limit, Windows will download only priority system updates over that WiFi connection while holding up less vital downloads. It may also let app updates wait and pause online file-synchronization tasks.
Apple’s macOS doesn’t ship with any built-in options to regulate data usage on a particular WiFi network, but a third-party app can help. The free Bandwidth+, available on the Mac App Store, puts an estimate of your consumption on a designated WiFi network in a Mac’s menu bar.
You can add your wireless plan’s hotspot cap to the app, but it won’t flash a warning when you near it. The app also doesn’t currently discount data flowing only across your home network—for instance, to a networked backup drive—although its developers say they’re working to fix that.
Neither of these solutions will break down your data usage by app, so it’s up to you to avoid the biggest data hogs. You’re going to have to lay off the Netflix and other streaming-media apps, which shouldn’t cause too much pain if you pair your phone with a Chromecast or an Apple TV, and avoid cloud-sync options for your files.
And when Apple or Microsoft ship their major operating-system updates, which can total hundreds of gigabytes, you’ll definitely have to walk or drive to somebody else’s wireless network. If you can, use one in the stores of those two companies, where you can also summon help if anything goes amiss.

"Research revealing the broad spectrum toxicity of statin drugs continues to accumulate unabated. A study reveals that these cholesterol-lowering drugs may be contributing to an epidemic of arthritis and autoimmunity in exposed populations, adding to a growing body of clinical evidence that they may cause over 300 adverse health effects.
Published this month in the journal Arthritis Research & Therapy, and titled “Statins accelerate the onset of collagen type II-induced arthritis in mice,” researchers found that 100% of the animals given statin drugs developed arthritis and markers of autoimmunity versus 58% in the control population who did not receive them.[1]
The study was performed in the wake of an observational study showing that statin drug use was associated with an increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.[2] The researchers hypothesized that statin drug use may eventually lead to dysregulation of immune responses, possibly resulting in autoimmunity. This finding does not come as a great surprise considering that statins have already been linked to lupus-like syndrome,[3] as well as immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy.[4]
Because atherosclerosis is known to have an autoimmune component, the emerging connection between statins and autoimmunity may undermine the justification for their continued use in the primary prevention of heart disease. Lesions form in an artery only after the body’s immune system snowballs out of control. White blood cells (macrophages and T-lymphoctyles) infiltrate the damaged area in an attempt to heal it, absorbing oxidized-LDL in the process, and eventually depositing in the artery wall as foam cells, triggering more white blood cells to infiltrate in a vicious cycle.
The blood work of heart disease patients has also shown elevations of a well-known marker of autoimmunity in the blood, namely, antinuclear antibodies.[5] What is more concerning is that statin drugs have been shown to induce elevations of these same antibodies,[6]not only calling into question their utility in preventing heart disease, but implicating them as potentially cardiotoxic agents.
Indeed, the cardiotoxicity of statin drugs was demonstrated back in 2009 when the journal of Clinical Cardiology showed that statin drugs actually weaken the heart muscle.[7] In addition, the GreenMedInfo.com statin drugs research page now contains 76 studies indicating the myotoxicity (muscle-damaging) effect of statins and 53 studies indicating their neurotoxicity (nerve-damaging). Since the heart is a highly innervated muscle, using them for “protecting” the heart is an insurmountable contradiction.

"Safe Space Protection recently wrote this informative report: “Power lines and electrical poles have become so common on the landscape, they are virtually invisible. But it’s worth taking a hard look at them. Are you living near power lines? What is that barrel-shaped device on the electric pole and is it harmful? Did you grow up near a high-voltage power line?
Experts say as far as possible … Hundreds of studies worldwide have shown that living next to high voltage power lines and other parts of the power transmission network increases your risk of cancer and other health problems. We’ll examine those risks below, and the recommended SafeSpace solutions designed to minimize and eliminate the health risks.
Absolutely possible. It depends on how powerful are the EMFs coming from your neighborhood power lines? The electrical power grid uses a “step down” system of distribution, highest near the generating station and substations, lowest at the end. The closer you are the more you are bombarded with dangerous EMFs.
High voltage transmission lines (those towering metal power lines you often see usually along highways and across rural landscapes. Some folks, unfortunately are under them.):
Use high voltage direct current (HVDC) to transmit large amounts of power from the generating station over long distances
Voltage varies from 138kV to 765kV
Radiate powerful electromagnetic fields (EMFs)
Linked to diseases in animals and humans
There is growing speculation that the values of homes near major power lines will soon begin to decrease because of this threat
Transmission substations, (which often look like a fenced-in thicket of metal structures. Maybe you see one near your home, school or office.):
Contain circuit breakers, switches and transformers
Decrease the voltage coming from high voltage transmission lines
Connect to local, lower voltage distribution lines.
Reroute power to lines that serve local markets
Suspected cause of cancer clusters for nearby residents
Lower voltage distribution lines, (or local power poles, which are everywhere):
Are smaller than the huge high voltage lines
More likely to be seen in residential areas
Sometimes buried
Risk varies with strength of voltage
Transformers, (those barrel-like metal trashcans mounted on power poles are EMF factories.):
Reduces the voltage to the 120-/240 current needed by the nearby homes
The typical power line feeding the transformer is carrying 4000 to 13,000 volts
Creates a strong field extending up to a 1/4 of a mile
The strength of this field decreases significantly with distance (the further away you are the better, even if you are still within a quarter mile)
Health risk depends on strength of incoming power line
Buried lines and transformers (Recognizable by a metal box located on the ground near the street.):
Some people contend that burying power lines can mitigate EMF dangers. Other experts note that while burying power lines will shield the electric component of the electromagnetic field (EMF), the magnetic component can still pass through the earth—and walls and human bodies.
Electrical field: the part of the EMF that can easily be shielded.
Magnetic field: part of the EMF that can penetrate stone, steel and human flesh. In fact, when it comes to magnetic fields, human flesh and bone has the same penetrability as air!
Both fields are invisible and perfectly silent: if you live in an area with electric power, cell phone service, water pipes and more, some level of artificial EMF is surrounding you.
Your body acts like an energy wave broadcaster and receiver, incorporating and responding to EMFs. In fact, scientific research has demonstrated that every cell in your body may have its own EMF, helping to regulate important functions and keep you healthy. Strong, artificial EMFs like those from power lines can scramble and interfere with your body’s natural EMF, harming everything from your sleep cycles and stress levels to your immune response and DNA!
After hundreds of international studies, the evidence linking EMFs to cancers and other health problems is loud and clear. High Voltage power lines are the most obvious and dangerous culprits, but the same EMFs exist in gradually decreasing levels all along the grid, from substations to transformers to homes.
From the British Medical Journal, June, 2005:
Researchers found that children living within 650 feet of power lines had a 70% greater risk for leukemia than children living 2,000 feet away or more.
From Epidemiology, 2003 Jul;14(4):413-9:
“Several studies have identified occupational exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) as a potential risk factor for neurodegenerative disease.”
From Epidemiology, 2002 Jan;13(1):9-20
There is “strong prospective evidence that prenatal maximum magnetic field exposure above a certain level (possibly around 16 mG) may be associated with miscarriage risk.”
From the Internal Medicine Journal, 2007
In a study of 850 lymphoma, leukemia and related conditions, researchers from the University of Tasmania and Britain’s Bristol University found that living for a prolonged period near high-voltage power lines increased the risk for these conditions later in life.
People who lived within 328 yards of a power line up to age 5 were five times more likely to develop cancer as an adult.
People who lived within 328 yards of a power line at any point up to age 15 years were three times more likely to develop cancer as an adult.
Dr. David Carpenter, Dean of the School of Public Health (SUNY), believes that up to 30% of all childhood cancers come from exposure to high voltage power lines.
Even the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cautions citizens that “There is reason for concern” and advises “prudent avoidance” of high voltage power lines.
The California Department of Health concluded that EMFs were responsible for an increase in childhood leukemia, adult brain cancer, Lou Gehrig’s disease and miscarriage in the 2002 report, “An Evaluation of the Possible Risks From Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMFs) From Power Lines, Internal Wiring, Electrical Occupations and Appliances.”
The studies cited above and dozens of other epidemiological studies specifically link high voltage power lines with:
Brain tumors
Leukemia
Birth defects
Lymphoma
Electromagnetic Radiation and Power Lines. It‘s a Problem.
According to research and publications put out by the World Health Organization (WHO), EMF such as those from power lines, can also cause:
High voltage power lines, and radiation are something that can affect urban and rural communities alike. In truth, few residential areas escape this threat. For now, it’s critical to understand your risk of liivng close to power lines and how protect the area around you.",1
"When it comes to wine, sometimes it’s a guessing game as to what we’ll see next. There are wine popsicles, a Champagne vending machine and even blue wine. And now there’s a new green wine called Canna Vine that is infused with marijuana.
The idea of mixing pot and wine is nothing new, but the idea of selling it to the masses is. Canna Vine, which is green in color, is made with high-end organically grown marijuana. The creators are continuing to experiment with two new types of marijuana, sativa and indica, to find an equal balance of “uplifting and relaxing sensations.”
But regardless of the strain, it’s reported that the process used to make this weed-infused wine starts with around a pound of marijuana. The weed is then wrapped in cheese cloth and added to a barrel of wine, where it sits for nearly a year to ferment and repose.
The wine is designed to deliver a mellow “body high” without large effects from THC, which is the primary psychoactive compound found within marijuana. THC is responsible for the disoriented mental high many people experience when they smoke or ingest marijuana.
For now, Canna Vine is available only in California to those who hold a medical marijuana license. But even if you are able to get your hands on this new green wine, you’re looking at a price range of anywhere from $120 to $4o0 for just a half of a bottle.
However, the two founders, Lisa Molyneux and Louisa Sawyer Lindquist, said they’ll continue to refine the wine in their desire to position themselves in the market of high-quality cannabis-infused products.
“Cannabis wine has been so effective as a stress reliever, as a mood elevator, and as a medicine,” Lindquist told the LA Times. “I have no idea what the market will be like for it, but whatever I make I want to be safe, made from pure ingredients and, hopefully, delicious.”",1
"A bus has been stoned and torched in Jerusalem in the latest wave of violence to hit the city. The Mayor of Jerusalem Nir Barkat says serious measures are needed to stop young Palestinians from throwing firebombs and rocks in the capital. He has called on the police to use live ammunition if they are to counter escalating attacks against themselves and Jewish civilians.
READ MORE: Israel approves use of police sniper fire against Palestinian rock-throwers – reports
RT:Jerusalem’s Mayor is saying police must use live ammunition if they are to counter escalating attacks. Isn’t that a step too far?
James Petras:It’s an extreme measure; it’s in line with Israeli policy toward protests in the occupied territories. Israel has been using live ammunition – if you look at the human rights record of the Israeli state – every single day there is a violent entry into housing and Palestinian communities. There is violent intervention into the holy places, the sacred grounds of the Islamic groups in Jerusalem. So I think this is an extreme measure taken by Israel essentially in line with its violent occupation of the Palestinians and violation of human rights. I think most of the human rights organizations in Israel now have condemned Israel’s use of live ammunition and now the use of snipers to shoot protesters is an escalation of an ongoing policy.
RT:It’s surely going to increase tensions, isn’t it?
JP:It certainly will, and I think that’s the purpose of Israel is to try to inflame the Palestinians into a major uprising so they can slaughter them wholesale instead of retail.
RT:Is it even legal to use firearms against those not even armed? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the attorney general to authorize sniper fire against stone-throwers too.
JP:It’s certainly illegal. I don’t know any government in the world except Israel which takes this position. Most governments, especially democratic governments, resort to non-lethal types of assaults on protesters and they usually use tear gas, water cannons and occasionally tasers. But Israel’s use of armed weapons is something you find in African dictatorships or in countries that resort out of force and violence as their first principle. It’s certainly not an expression of a democratic government which Israel claims to be.
RT:There has been recent unrest at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which is a sacred site for both Muslims and Jews. Do you think Israel’s actions will just prompt further violence and more bloodshed?
JP:There have been deaths and killings by Israeli forces that invade the West Bank. We saw during the war against Gaza the disproportion of casualties: 2,000 Palestinians were killed including 500 children and I think two Israelis were killed, and it’s not clear whether they died because of their own side shooting each other. So the disproportionate casualties, the disproportionate killings, the ongoing violence against the West Bank speaks ill of Netanyahu’s current pronouncements.",1
"Why You Should Uninstall The Facebook Messenger App IMMEDIATELY!
Facebook Is Spying On You, BIGGER THAN EVER! Facebook may be the new ‘Big Brother’ in town with its mandatory Messenger App. This new app is getting terrible reviews. It has received only 1star out of 5 at the iPhone app store and similar ratings with android.
What the messenger basically does is requires you to give away all of your privacy and allows Facebook to look at your call list, contacts, text messages and even use your recording device and your camera on your phone without even telling you.
So when active, Facebook is able to spy on you with your device – Your front camera, or your back camera. Legally you are giving them access to those cameras when you download the application.
So yes, some creepy guy that works for Facebook can be looking at all the photos on your phone – those risqué pictures of your wife or your bikini selfies. Or even worse, child molesters have jobs, maybe some work at Facebook – what about the pictures you have of your children on your phone? They are all legally accessible by Facebook and their team of people.
Most people are downloading this because they want to message their friends through Facebook and are not even realizing that they are giving up their privacy. Most people just click ‘Yes’ when it prompts you to download the app, and never give it a second thought. We already have text messaging on our phones, why do we need the Facebook Messenger App?

"High blood pressure is an epidemic that is currently sweeping across America. The fast lifestyle of fast food, soda and stress is starting to catch up on the average American, so much so that an estimated one in every three Americans has high blood pressure. This puts them at risk of heart disease, stroke and even kidney disease. Moreover, this condition is costing the country 93.5 billion dollars in health care services.
Putting too much faith in the medical establishment to find a cure for your high blood pressure may no longer be advisable in the least. The number of prescription drugs on the market and the cascade of variations suggest that a cure for blood pressure is not in the offing anytime soon.
Despite all the consequences associated with high blood pressure, it is still a condition that is preventable and easily managed. Observing a healthy balanced diet and enjoying an active, healthy lifestyle can help avoid the risk of high blood pressure as well as reduce one that is already elevated.
There is no one identifiable cause for high blood pressure. A combination of factors like stress, alcohol, smoking, weight and lack of physical activity seem to have to come together to produce this problem, which is further compounded by family history and age.
Although it is a condition that if left unattended could gravitate to something worse, high blood pressure is not a disease. Taking proactive measures in preventing heart diseases, stroke and even kidney disease by managing your blood pressure may be the best decision you can make today.
While the idea of drug-free high blood pressure management through the use of herbs and spices has slowly been gaining ground, it is still treated with skepticism by the medical establishment. The reliance on prescription drugs, however, has not in any way shown that high blood pressure could be cured through this manner. There are still reports by patients who are currently using drugs to manage their high blood pressure that their condition has not shown any improvement, nor their quality of life. Instead, they have to deal with side effects and drugs that are expensive to maintain.
In a published study featured in theJournal of Medicine, it was revealed that common spices can protect from heart disease and the deterioration brought about by aging. In the said study, researchers discovered a connection between the phenol content of certain herbs and spices and their capacity to prevent glycation and formation of AGE compounds that are responsible for premature aging and heart disease.
As a way to manage your blood pressure, herbs and spices are a fantastic way to increase the medicinal value of your food. Below are some herbs and spices you may have been enjoying with no idea as to their value:
1.Garlic– Garlic contains allicin, a substance which has antibacterial, antioxidant, lipid lowering and anti-hypertension properties. In a pilot study made atClinical Research Center of New Orleanson whether garlic could lower blood pressure, nine patients with severe hypertension were given a garlic preparation containing 1.3 % allicin. Sitting blood pressure fell with a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure only five to 14 hours after the dose. Moreover, it was proven in a 2009 study that fresh garlic has more potent cardio-protective properties than processed garlic.
2. Cinnamon– Cinnamon not only prevents heart disease, it can also prevent diabetes.The Center for Applied Health Sciencesin Ohio conducted a study of 22 subjects, half of which were given a 250mg of water soluble cinnamon daily while the other half were given placebo. It was discovered that those who drank cinnamon had a 13 to 23 percent increase in antioxidants connected with lowering blood sugar levels.
3.Onions– Onions contain quercetin, an antioxidant flavonol found to prevent heart disease and stroke. In a research study published in theJournal of Nutrition, subjects with hypertension experienced a decrease in their blood pressure by 7mmHg systolic and 5 mmHg diastolic as opposed to those who were taking placebo.
4.Olives– This herb is a significant part of the Mediterranean diet, recognized to be one of the healthiest in the world. Oil made from olives has been found to reduce blood pressure. In a study conducted on the importance of olive oil, Dr. L. Aldo Ferrara, Associate Professor at theFrederico II University of Naplesin Italy discovered that the daily use of 40 grams of olive oil reduced the dosage of blood pressure medication in hypertensive patients by about 50 percent. Polyphenols in extra-virgin olive oil was credited for the significant reduction of blood pressure.
5. Oregano– This herb contains the compound carvacrol which has been proven to be effective against blood pressure. In a study conducted on animal subjects, by researchers fromEskisehir Osmangazi Universityin Turkey, carvacrol was found to reduce heart rate, mean arterial pressure as well as the systolic and diastolic blood pressures.
6.Hawthorn– This herb has been traditionally used to treat high blood pressure. In one study conducted in Reading, UK, 79 type-2 diabetic patients were randomized to receive 1200 mg of hawthorn extract while another group received medication for high blood pressure. Results revealed that patients taking hawthorn by the end of the 16th week showed a reduction in their mean diastolic pressure.
7.Cardamom– In one study published in theIndian Journal of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 20 subjects newly diagnosed with primary hypertension were administered 3 g of cardamom powder. After the end of the 3 months, all the subjects experienced feelings of well-being without any side effects. Moreover, the study was able to demonstrate that blood pressure was effectively reduced. It also improved antioxidant status while breaking down blood clots without significantly altering blood lipids and fibrinogen levels.
Taking advantage of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of spices and herbs is an excellent way to boost your body’s health. Herbs have low calorie content, increase the medicinal value of your food and allow you to use natural forms of lowering blood pressure. Mix them up with your soups, salads, fish and meat and vegetable dishes. It’s a healthier and cheaper alternative to keeping bottles of prescription drugs and synthetic supplements.",1

The US Army and General Motors have teamed up to explore a new method of power for Army vehicles that could deliver near silent operation and hard-to-detect heat signatures.
The new vehicle, known as the Chevrolet Colorado ZH2, was displayed at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) exhibition yesterday. The truck, which uses hydrogen fuel-cells, immediately drew a crowd filled with active duty military personnel.
Based on the existing Chevrolet Colorado truck, the ZH2 has a lot of modifications for military purposes. For starters, it is reinforced inside and out. To tackle the extreme terrain the military faces, it also has a specially modified suspension.
The fuel-cell-powered electric vehicle is more than six and a half feet tall and more than seven feet wide. It has 37-inch tires and based on a stretched midsize pickup chassis. If chosen to go downrange, then it would be the very first combat vehicle powered with a hydrogen fuel-cell.
GM has worked closely with the U. S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) on the vehicle. Testing this fuel-cell vehicle for potential military uses began in January of this year and is expected to last a year.
PODCAST: LEARN TO DRIVE YOUR CAR LIKE JAMES BOND WITH THIS SPECIAL FORCES EXPERT
Beating the heat and the noise
With wide potential, hydrogen fuel-cells could mean significantly reduced heat signatures and near silent power-train systems.
Heat signatures are a big challenge for combat. Normally, a vehicle with an internal combustion engine is going to give off a lot of heat. This heat can be detected to reveal location and compromise a team’s location.
But if the enemy is hunting for Army vehicles with infrared cameras and they scan the ZH2 while it is running, the heat this new vehicle gives off is so low that it makes the vehicle almost invisible.
Humvees give off approximately 750 degrees of heat, so they can be detected from more than three miles away. The ZH2’s fuel-cell electric drivetrain, on the other hand, only gives off approximately 140 degrees making it harder to detect and allowing the vehicle to get closer to a target before detection. Some estimates place detection at about one mile away.
Why does that matter? For starters, it means that an enemy has far less warning American forces are about to arrive and far less time to react.
PODCAST: DISCOVER THE SECRETS TO WORKING OUT LIKE SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES
Hydrogen fuel cell tech is advancing rapidly – but is it stable enough and safe enough for Army use?
Performance and safety are two key issues that must be proven for the military to even consider adopting a new vehicle.
Chevrolet’s view is that hydrogen fuel stored at pressure is no more dangerous than conventional fuel. The ZH2 tanks store hydrogen at 10,000 psi. So far in the military testing, it seems to be safe enough for use in ground vehicles.
To evaluate the safety of the hydrogen fuel storage, the ZH2 tank has reportedly been shot with 7.62 mm standard, incendiary and armor piercing rounds. It has also been shot with .50 caliber rounds. Buzz at AUSA suggests that a rocket-propelled grenade round penetrated, but failed to explode.
Based on testing so far, the tanks seem almost bulletproof. But if the tank does become breached, then the ZH2 is designed to vent the volatile hydrogen.
WOMEN, ARE YOU READY FOR DANGER? 7 MUST HAVE THINGS TO CARRY EVERYDAY
In the bed of the ZH2, there is also a portable generator (known as a Exportable Power Take Off unit) that can provide power. If a military team arrives in an area without electricity, then they just have to pull the generator out of the vehicle and they’re good to go.
It could be particularly handy for teams working in remote forward operating base to power essentials like communications and surveillance tech. Or a reconnaissance team could use the generator to enable staying in place for longer, for example.
This fuel-cell-powered military vehicle also produces water as a byproduct. Eventually, the water could be captured and used by teams as well.
Providing a generator is handy, but hydrogen to power that vehicle and generator in the battlespace is currently not exactly easy to come by.
Jet Propellant 8 (otherwise known asJP8) is, however, easy to come by and is used for common things like tanks and trucks. TARDEC has a reformer that converts JP8 to hydrogen.
So if military vehicles use this sort of revolutionary fuel cell power in the future, then the H2 tanks could be filled using this reformer device.
This story has been updated to reflect the ZH2 was displayed at AUSA 2017 and not revealed.

"Almost as soon as news broke of a fatal crash involving Tesla's Autopilot last year, fans and detractors of the electric-car manufacturer have been clear on the tragedy's causes. Tesla's supporters and investors have never doubted that the system improves safety, so the driver must have failed to heed Tesla's warnings and remain attentive. Detractors and short investors, on the other hand, have been all but certain that Autopilot somehow failed to protect the car's driver, allowing him to drive directly into a semi at 74 miles per hour.
After more than a year of debate a conclusive answer is finally at hand, courtesy of a National Transportation Safety Boardinvestigationwhose final results were presentedthis week. Butthe board's findingsaren't likely to leave either side happy: Rather than blaming man or machine alone, it seems that both human drivers and the Autopilot system -- specifically the complex relationship between the two -- contributed to the deadly event.
At the heart of the matter is a dangerous dynamic: With billions at stake in the frantic race to develop self-driving car technology, there are huge incentives for carmakers to create the impression that vehicles for sale today are ""autonomous."" But as the NTSB made clear, no vehicle now on the market is capable of safe autonomous driving. When consumers take high-tech hype at face value, a lethal gap between perception and reality can open.
Tesla reaped months of laudatory coverage and billions worth of market cap by presenting its Autopilot system as being more autonomous than any other advanced driver assist systems, even as it warned owners they must remain attentive and in control at all times. ThoughAutopilot did offer better performance than other advanced driver assistance systems, the key to its success was the lack of limitations Tesla put on its use. Because Autopilot allows owners to drive hands-free anywhere, even on roads where Tesla has warned that such use would not be safe,the company has been able to profit off the perception that its system was more autonomous than others.
But Autopilot was actually designed for use on well-marked, protected highways with no chance of cross-traffic. So when the tractor-trailer turned across Florida's Highway 27 last May, and the Tesla slammed directly into it without triggering any safety systems, Autopilot was working exactly as designed. The problem was that it was being used on a road with conditions it wasn't designed to cope with, and the driver had apparently been lulled into complacency. Far from failing, Autopilot was actually so good that it led the driver to believe it was more capable than it really was.
This complex failure, which both man and machine contributed to, sounds an important warning about autonomous-drive technology: until the systems are so good they need no human input, the human driver must remain at the center of ""semi-autonomous"" drive system design. Engineers must assume that if there's a way for people to misuse these systems, they will. Just as important, companies need to understand that if they over-promote a semi-autonomous drive system's capabilities in hopes of pulling ahead in the race to autonomy, they run the risk of making the technology less safe than an unassisted human driver.
There'sa lesson to be learned here from aviation. As computers and sensors improved in the 1980s, aircraft manufacturers began to automate more and more of the controls simply because they could. Only later did the industry realize that adding automation for the sake of automation actually made aircraft less safe, so they re-oriented autopilot development around the principle of ""human-centric"" automation. Only when automation is deployed in ways that are designed to improve pilot performance does safety actually improve.
If anything, this dynamic will be more pronounced with automobiles, which that are used in much higher numbers than planes by people with much less training. But unlike aircraft companies, which join forces to improve safety across the industry, automakers and tech startups are in intense competition for the real or perceived lead in the race to autonomy.
As long as consumers care more about the futuristic cool factor of hands-free operation than using technology to become safer drivers, the potential for a dangerous gap between the perception and reality of autonomous-drive technology remains. And what a shame it would be if this technology, whichhas the potential to someday save tens of thousands of lives every year, actually made cars less safe in the short term.

"The cellphone footage is jarring: An apparently high motorist is slumped behind the wheel of a van stopped in the middle of an Ohio street.
His face is ashy white. His eyes are dead to the world. His vehicle is still in gear but not moving because his foot, unaccountably, is still on the brake.
“Hey dude! Hey! Hey! Hey!” Jennifer Dillon, the motorist who shot the footage, yells. “You gotta wake up man! You gotta wake up! You cannot die!”
Thanks to the overdose antidote Narcan, the man did indeed survive, said Lt. Don Grossmyer of the Maple Heights, Ohio police department.
“I could tell you he was released before we could get to the hospital to talk to him,” he said.
But for Grossmyer, this was just the latest example of a troubling trend that law enforcement is seeing elsewhere in Ohio and in other states that are struggling to contain an epidemic of opioid overdoses — motorists driving while drugged.
“I don’t know the numbers for that, but I can tell you it’s a newer upcoming occurrence,” Grossmyer told NBC News. “Just recently, within the last year, we’ve being seeing this.”
J. T. Griffin, chief government affairs officer for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said ""opioids and heroin are not traditionally something that is abused while people are driving.""
""But we're definitely keeping an eye on it,"" he said. ""The stories you hear are horrible. You hear of parents getting high in cars and just passing out.""
Perhaps the best known example of that happened last September in East Liverpool, Ohio, where police posted a photo of a couple passed out from a drug overdose in a van while a young child looks on helplessly from a back seat.
""Alcohol is still the biggest drug drivers are abusing, marijuana is the other,"" said Griffin.
And those numbers are staggering.
The 2014 National Survey of Drug Use and Health found that 10 million people ages 12 or older admitted driving under the influence of “illicit drugs,” a category that includes marijuana, heroin, cocaine, tranquilizers and “misuse of prescription medications.”
The feds also appear to share Grossmyer’s concerns.
The National Highway Safety Administration reported last year that the percentage of drivers who tested positive for drugs in a 2014 survey was a whopping 20 percent. The agency also cited a 2011 study which concluded “the prevalence of drugged driving is similar to drunk driving among college students.”
Also, a report on the NHTSA site under the heading “Dangers of Drugged Driving,” showed a “steep” 9.3 percent increase in traffic deaths for the first nine months of 2015.
Among the biggest jumps in deaths were in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Michigan and Indiana, where local officials are grappling with drug overdoses. Even bigger increases were seen in the Pacific Northwest and South (including Florida), which have also been dealing with an upsurge in heroin and methamphetamine abuse.
One reason why there are more reports of driving while on drugs may be because the addicts aren't waiting to get home to get high. And heroin addicts, in particular, have to keep to a fixed schedule.
""Addicts know that if they get high at 2 p.m., they know they’re going to want to high again at 6 p.m. because they won’t want to go through withdrawal,” Sue Marchese-Debiak, coordinator of the Bergen County Office of Addiction Services in New Jersey, told The Patch.com. “They know the timing.”",0
"The Taste Of Wine Isn't All In Your Head, But Your Brain Sure Helps : The Salt   Savoring the flavor of wine activates more gray matter than solving a complex math problem, according to neuroscientist Gordon Shepherd. His new book, Neurenology, explores your brain on wine.
The Taste Of Wine Isn't All In Your Head, But Your Brain Sure Helps
What's On Your Plate
The Taste Of Wine Isn't All In Your Head, But Your Brain Sure Helps
Molecules in wine stimulate thousands of taste and odor receptors, sending a flavor signal to the brain that triggers massive cognitive computation involving pattern recognition, memory, value judgment, emotion and, of course, pleasure.
What do listening to music, hitting a baseball and solving a complex math problem have in common? They all activate less gray matter than drinking wine.   According to Yale neuroscientist Gordon Shepherd, the flavor of wine ""engages more of our brain than any other human behavior."" The apparently simple act of sipping Merlot involves a complex interplay of air and liquid controlled by coordinated movements of the the tongue, jaw, diaphragm and throat. Inside the mouth, molecules in wine stimulate thousands of taste and odor receptors, sending a flavor signal to the brain that triggers massive cognitive computation involving pattern recognition, memory, value judgment, emotion and of course, pleasure.   Whereas most wine writers tend to focus on the various elements that go into the wine itself — the grape, the oak, terroir, the winemaker — Shepherd's subject is the drinker. He explores biomechanics, physiology and neuroscience to describe a journey that begins as wine passes the lips and ends with a lingering ""finish"" that can last for minutes.
How the Brain Creates the Taste of Wine
If you've ever wondered how many muscles there are in the tongue (eight), if a high-fat diet can affect the perception of wine (it can), or if it's possible to experience the full flavor of a wine that's been spat out (it is not), Shepherd has answers — extraordinarily detailed, scientifically rigorous answers. I spoke to Shepherd about his new book, Neuroenology: How the Brain Creates the Taste of Wine. Our interview has been condensed and edited.   The subtitle of your book is ""How the Brain Creates the Taste of Wine."" Can you explain what that means?   The analogy one can use is color. The objects we see don't have color themselves — light hits them and bounces off. It's when light strikes our eyes that it activates systems in the brain that create color from those different wavelengths. Similarly, the molecules in wine don't have taste or flavor, but when they stimulate our brains, the brain creates flavor the same way it creates color.   Chapter one is on fluid dynamics, a subject you almost never hear mentioned by wine connoisseurs. How does fluid dynamics inform our understanding of wine?   You don't just put wine in your mouth and leave it there. You move it about and then swallow it, which is a very complex motor act. If you search on YouTube for anyone doing serious wine tasting, they are working it with their mouths. It's a very active process. So to understand the physiology of tasting wine, it's necessary to give people a whole new context of how wine sensing and wine tasting takes place.   You talk about a ""hidden force"" in wine tasting. What is it?   When you sniff wine in the glass, you appreciate the bouquet. That's called ""orthonasal"" smell — the external smelling we're all familiar with. But what most people are unaware of is that when you take wine in your mouth and experience the flavor, most of that flavor is due to a kind of internal smelling. The air comes in from the throat, not your nostrils. That's called ""retronasal"" smell. The molecules are carried to the same receptor cells in the nose, but from the opposite direction. This is very important when it comes to wine flavor. An example is the famous jelly bean test. If you put a jelly bean in your mouth and plug your nose and sense it with your tongue, all you sense is sweet from the sugar. But if you then unplug your nose, suddenly you're flooded with the full flavor experience, and it's because you're smelling through the back of your nose.   One thing you write about that I've never read elsewhere is the effect saliva has on wine.
Fruity With A Hint Of Bologna: A Slacker's Guide To Wine Tasting
Our bodies produce saliva all the time, and saliva has stuff in it — stuff that both dilutes the wine and interacts with it. So as soon as the wine enters your mouth, it immediately begins to change. For example, saliva contains enzymes that break down the molecules in the wine to create compounds that effervesce into the air to stimulate the smell receptors in your nose. This produces new compounds that were not originally in the wine — they were created by this interaction.   The amount of saliva a person produces can affect their perception of wine. So can things like age, gender, or even the amount of acetone — a byproduct of energy metabolism — in a person's breath.   And the time of day. And whether or not they're depressed. If we're talking about smell, we have about 350 different kinds of olfactory receptors. They are not the same between individuals — yours will be different than mine. And they're not always the same over the course of months or years. As the cells turn over, they can change.   Given all these subjective variables, and the fact that the brain ""creates"" the taste of wine, is it possible for two people to experience the same wine in the same way?   There is still a commonality. We all know it's a liquid, after all. We all know it comes from fruit. We all know it contains alcohol. And we all have saliva that is more or less the same. So probably 90 percent is the same and 10 percent is different. That's part of the pleasure of wine —comparing your pleasure.   Does your research suggest wine drinkers are doing anything wrong?   Within a few sips or drinks, people are just downing the stuff. There needs to be more to it than that. If you take too large a sip, you've saturated your system.      My wife and I have a sit-down meal every night. We used to use modest stemware, but we would occasionally knock it over and it would break, so now we use plain water glasses. But if we're having a proper sort of dinner, we use some kind of glass with a bowl so you can capture the aroma. Just fill the bottom few cubic centimeters, because if you fill up a glass you don't get much aroma. The reason for having a large bowl is that it amplifies the headspace for sniffing in the bouquet and you take small sips. But once you understand the flow dynamics that I describe, you can make your own choice as to how important the glass will be.   I will end with what may be the most enduring question in science. What's the best value in wine for under $20?   For table wine, we stick to around $10 or $12 per bottle, and it's a fun challenge to find a wine in that range. I don't want to mention any names, because that would give someone a commercial advantage. For more interesting wines, we like Sancerre because it seems to have an edge to it. [Editor's note: Sancerre is a designated wine district in the eastern Loire Valley known mostly for wines made from Sauvignon Blanc.] One of the reasons I prefer European wines is they have a slightly lower alcoholic content. There is research that shows people prefer wines with less alcohol. This is important, because global warming is driving alcohol content up, not down.

"Outlined below are all the parts we recommend for a full liver cleanse including herbs, foods, and further steps.
One of the key products in any liver cleanse program is a combination of specially selected herbs that encourage your body to heal damaged liver cells, strengthen your liver’s ability to provide vital functions and stimulate flushing of wastes from your liver and gallbladder.
Milk Thistle seed, Dandelion root, Burdock root, Gentian root, Parsley root are some of the traditional herbs proven to enhance liver function. Different properties are extracted from herbs depending on if they are concentrated in alcohol, or in water infusions. We recommend using both in formulas that are alcohol extracted and made into a hot herbal tea thereby getting the full spectrum of benefits.
Our Liver Cleanse Concentrate comes in liquid tincture form and is taken throughout the day while cleansing your liver to target areas that need support for healthier liver function. We recommend putting the concentrate in the Liver Cleanse Tea to get the full effect from the herbs. The herbs in this tea stimulate, cleanse and protect your liver and gallbladder while making an unfriendly environment for any parasites that might be living in those systems. Plus, this tea smells and tastes great, and can be used as a wonderful coffee or black tea replacement!
There are certain foods with a well-earned reputation for supporting and cleansing the liver. Adding any of these to your daily diet will provide extra nutritional support for this cleansing program.
LemonsFresh lemon juice is the best food for helping your liver make more enzymes. The fresh juice has a chemical structure very similar to many of the body’s own digestive enzymes so it is great in providing raw materials for the creation of liver enzymes. As an antioxidant, lemon juice can work on and stabilize free radicals that are released into the bloodstream during digestion. An antiseptic, it also helps neutralize harmful bacteria. Fresh lemon juice squeezed into water is easy to take and is the top daily diet addition for cleansing and stimulating the liver.

* ApplesGallstones can form from too much cholesterol in your bile which causes it to solidifiy. The pectin in apples is high in soluable fiber which binds with fats and cholesterol. Pectin also helps bind heavy metals thus lightening the load on the liver for their detoxification.
As part of the10 Day Complete Liver Cleanse Program, we provide you with a recipe for a simple to makeLiver Flush Drinkthat is consumed each morning for 5 days. The citrus juices in the Liver Flush drink provides your body with electrolytes, flush out mucus, are diuretic, alkalize the blood and help dissolve gallstones. It also contains garlic olive oil and ginger. A traditional home remedy for removing fat-soluble toxins such as pesticide residues from the body. The liver flush has also a reputation for expeling gallstones.
Keep in mind you are trying to clean your body of toxins and wastes so it doesn’t make sense to consume heavy unhealthy foods and drinks while cleansing. We advise eating light, raw fruits and vegetables, especially those above, the first and last day of cleansing with fresh juice and tea during the middle 3-5 days. Just by consuming all the liquid we recommend with the program including the tea, potassium broth and fresh juices, you will literally flush the liver out.
The more you lighten your diet and replace heavy processed foods with fresh whole foods the more benefits you’ll feel. Increased energy, better sleep, and a clearer head are all effects of a healthier liver.
Chemicals in certain foods and medications can affect the liver’s ability to detox, slowing down the process. For example, grapefruit juice is metabolized by the same enzyme in the liver that breaks down many drugs, so it can keep the liver busy, blocking the breakdown of the drugs. These then can remain in the blood at unhealthy levels, so many older people on medications are instructed to avoid grapefruit. Lemon juice, on the other hand, helps to produce liver enzymes, aiding detoxification.",1
"No doubt if you’re a product of a parochial education (Catholic school), then this little story will surly bring a smile to your face, especially in knowing that today’s bubble wrapped generation hasn’t filtered into this all boys Catholic high school in Little Rock, Arkansas.
And although for the most part many of the educators in the parochial school system within many parishes are no longer priests or nuns, the strict discipline that is however synonymous with a Catholic education, at least at this particular high school seems intact.
As demonstrated by a sign posted at the main entrance of the school which alerts parents who bring items that their sons forgot, with this little greeting:
“If you are dropping off your son’s forgotten lunch, books, homework, equipment, etc., please TURN AROUND and exit the building, your son will learn to problem-solve in your absence.”
However in all likelihood the majority of these students have already experienced the consequences of not being responsible and perhaps the sign is more in response to those over protective parents who attempt to run interference rather than allow junior to accept the fallout.
However one parent Margaret Barsocchi Willis was grateful writing;
“This is all about teaching young men (high schoolers are not children) to become responsible adult men and spouses and fathers through allowing ‘soft failures.”
Moreover a day or two without lunch or doubling up on a missing homework assignment is the quickest motivator of all, and a far cry from those days of corporeal punishment of a steel ruler smacked across your knuckles administered by an unsmiling and stern nun…”OUCH!”",1
"ATWATER, Calif. - Google's self-driving car spin-off is accelerating efforts to convince the public that its technology is almost ready to safely transport people without any human assistance at all.
Waymo, hatched from a Google (GOOG) project started eight years ago, showed off its progress Monday during a rare peek at a closely guarded testing facility located 120 miles southeast of San Francisco. That's where its robots complete their equivalent of driver's education.
The tour included giving more than three dozen reporters rides in Chrysler Pacifica minivans traveling through faux neighborhoods and expressways that Waymo has built on a former Air Force base located in the Californian Central Valley city of Atwater.
The minivans smoothly cruised the roads -- driver's seat empty and passengers in the back -- at speeds of up to 35 mph. By contrast, the Waymo-powered minivans that have been driving volunteer riders in the Phoenix area still use safety drivers to take over control if something goes wrong.
But Waymo's real goal is to get to the point where people in cars are nothing but passengers.
Waymo CEO John Krafcik told reporters the company will be making some cars and freight trucks totally driverless fairly soon, though he didn't provide a specific timetable. ""We are really close,"" he said. ""We are going to do it when we feel like we are ready.""
Since Google began working on self-driving cars in 2009, dozens of established automakers such as General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) have entered the race, along with other big technology companies, including Apple (APPL) and ride-hailing service Uber.
The competition is so fierce and the stakes so high thatWaymo is currently suing Uber, alleging that one of its former managers stole its trade secrets and took them with him when he joined Uber in 2016 as part of an elaborate scheme. The trial in that high-profile case is scheduled to begin in early December.
Waymo is hoping to infuse its technology into ride-hailing services such as its current partner, Lyft, and big-rig trucking companies. It also intends to license its automated system to automakers such as Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), which is already using it in 100 Pacifica minivans.",0
"Does that mean a mechanical dive watch is nothing but a retro affectation?
I always wear a dive watch on the wrist opposite a computer. First off, should the battery in the computer fail, you have a backup. Secondly, there are things an analog watch does better than a digital dive computer, such as helping time swim distances for navigation. At worst, it’s ornamental. When you’re back at work, you can always look down on your wrist and smile and think, “I just took this down to the wreck of the Hermes two weeks ago.”
That does not stop watch brands from pushing the engineering frontier. Several high-end dive watches, for example, come with a “helium escape valve.” Sounds cool, but what is it?
Saturation divers — like guys welding oil pipelines in the North Sea — live in a habitat pressurized to the same depth as the seawater in which they’re working, and the gas they’re breathing is high in helium content, which seeps into watches. The valve helps the gas escape. But those valves are utterly worthless to 99.9 percent of the people who buy them.
What about all the watches with crazy depth ratings? Citizen just came out with an Eco-Drive Professional Diver 1000M rated to go an insane 1,000 meters. Who needs that?
The fact is, most recreational divers don’t go deeper than 50 or 60 feet. A high-water resistance is a badge of honor, like a 200-mile-per-hour sports car.
What is a good example of a forward-looking dive watch done right?
The Tudor Pelagos. They really thought it through with the ceramic bezel, the titanium case and bracelet, and the spring-loaded clasp on the bracelet that compensates for the compression of a wet-suit sleeve. It’s very sleek, very modern — sort of the analog dive watch for the 21st century.
In the end, is a dive watch just a fantasy object for most guys, like an aviator watch?
Pilot watches feel even more aspirational to me. You put on this big Breitling Navitimer, and no one even knows how to use the slide-rule function. I’m sort of an aviation geek as well, but if it’s one or the other, I’m reaching for a dive watch nine out of 10 times. Water resistance just trumps all other functions. You never know when you’ll have to jump in a pool to save a drunken party guest.

"Canada’s highest court has given developers the green light to build a 6,250-bed ski resort on land considered sacred by an indigenous community in British Columbia, in a landmark court case that pitted religious rights against the controversial project.
The case centred around a proposal for a year-round ski resort on the site of an abandoned sawmill in south-eastern British Columbia. Plans for the Jumbo Glacier Resort include as many as 23 ski lifts, a gondola to ferry visitors into the soaring mountain peaks as well as accommodation for thousands of overnight guests.
The project met with stiff resistance from the Ktunaxa Nation, whose traditional connection to the land stretches back millennia. For hundreds of generations they have revered the area, which they call Qat’muk, as home of the Grizzly Bear Spirit.
The community worried that development would drive away the spirit – who figures prominently in their religious beliefs – turning their prayers and ceremonies into empty gestures. They pursued the issue in court, arguing that the destruction of their sacred site was a violation of their religious freedom.
Some in the community drew parallels with manmade places of worship such as churches or temples. “I wouldn’t even get through the gates if I was to show up at the Vatican with plans for a resort,” Joe Pierre said in an interview for a 2015 documentary against the backdrop of the region’s rugged, snow-capped mountain peaks. “It’s preposterous, right?”
The case was dismissed by several courts in British Columbia before arriving at the supreme court of Canada.
In a decision released on Thursday, the supreme court ruled that the project could proceed on the grounds of public interest. The majority of the judges found that the community’s freedom of religion had not been breached and noted that it is not the state’s duty to protect the Grizzly Bear Spirit.
“Rather, the state’s duty is to protect everyone’s freedom to hold such beliefs and to manifest them in worship and practice or by teaching and dissemination. In short, the Charter protects the freedom to worship, but does not protect the spiritual focal point of worship,” the ruling noted.
While two judges agreed that the project interferes with the Ktunaxa’s religious beliefs and practices in a way that is “more than trivial or insubstantial”, the court said that if it were to side with the Ktunaxa, it would “effectively transfer the public’s control of the use of over fifty square kilometres of land to the Ktunaxa.”
Doing so would enable the community to dictate the use of the land, setting a precedent that could run counter to public interest. “A religious group would therefore be able to regulate the use of a vast expanse of public land so that it conforms to its religious belief.”
The developers had made efforts to accommodate the Ktunaxa’s concerns, the court added, noting that plans for a recreational area and ski lifts in areas frequented by grizzly bears were removed from the project.
The Ktunaxa Nation said on Thursday that they were disappointed by the decision. “With this decision, the supreme court of Canada is telling every indigenous person in Canada that your culture, history and spirituality, all deeply linked to the land, are not worthy of legal protection from the constant threat of destruction,” said Kathryn Teneese, the Ktunaxa Nation council chair.
“We’re not opposed to people experiencing that place, we’re not opposed to people going there,” she added. “And I want to make that very clear – we’re not saying it’s off limits, we’re just saying it’s off limits to development.”
Those managing the project said they welcomed the decision but were not overly surprised, given the previous rulings by lower courts. “In our view it would have required a significant change of thought in order to overturn the lower court rulings,” said Tom Oberti, vice-president of the Pheidias Group.
While the government of British Columbia gave its approval to the project in 2012, he was unsure of what the timeline of the project would be. “Basically we’ve been on standby and now that there’s a decision, the board of Glacier Resorts needs to take steps forward.”
The decision comes amid Canada’s fledgling efforts to confront its historical mistreatment of the country’s indigenous population, a reality acknowledged by the country’s highest court on Thursday. “We arrive at these conclusions cognizant of the importance of protecting Indigenous religious beliefs and practices, and the place of such protection in achieving reconciliation between Indigenous peoples and non-Indigenous communities,” it noted in its ruling.
Teneese of the Ktunaxa Nation said the court’s actions failed to lived up to this promise. “Reconciliation is more than words, it is actions,” she said.
Lawyers for the Ktunaxa noted that the ruling made no mention of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which highlights the obligation of states to protect places of spiritual importance. Canada signed on to the declaration last year.
She pointed go the court’s argument that their decision was grounded in the public interest. “Are we not part of the public? Are we something so separate that our views need to be in another box? I would hope not. I would hope that’s not what this country is about.”

"Chicago gun control activist Camiella Williams justifies her concealed weapons permit and gun ownership by stating that her South Side Chicago neighborhood is too dangerous to live without one.
Camiella documents a long history of violence in her neighborhood that affected her starting at age nine. It was at nine that she was assaulted in her neighborhood with a brick. By age 12 she had become involved in gang activity and acquired her first gun. The cycle of violence continued as she grew up until the age of 18 when she gave birth to her son.
After the birth of her child she left the South Side neighborhood, she grew up in and became an advocate for gun control policies lobbying as far as Washington D. C. Not only does she continue to possess her gun and concealed weapons permit, but she also seems to be more than willing to use it if necessary. She was quoted as saying, “I mean I just know that I would probably retaliate.”
While she advocates others not to retaliate or to not bring a weapon to a hostile situation, she admits that she had considered grabbing her weapon when she went to confront the mother of an 18-year-old who had shot her 11-year-old child with a BB gun.
When asked about the inconsistency in her message and actions, she claimed that people don’t understand how dangerous the neighborhood is and how she needs the gun for protection. But isn’t that what many gun owners who are against gun control laws want as well?
Unfortunately, Williams is not the first in the line of activists who preach, lobby and support control, while enjoying the protections that gun ownership present. Another example was the recent women’s march which showed gun control activists funded by Michael Bloomberg flanked by armed security for protection.
Bloomberg was called out by Fox News’ Tucker Carlson who called the fact that gun controllers who wish to remove the rights of the common man to bear arms yet arm themselves with armed security details, hypocritical. He claims that they are utilizing the same rights and protections that everyone should have. He was quoted as saying, “If guns are so bad, then why does he surround himself with them. And again, people who are at real risk — like delivery guys — can’t have them?” So why should those who lobby against the right to bear arms enjoy the freedoms and protections that they allow?
Even Gun Control Activists See the Value of Gun Ownership
As this case and many others have shown, the use of gun ownership as a means for self-defense, or the protection of others seems to be a valid ideal across most groups. Do activists realize that they are fighting to remove the right to protect themselves that they are claiming to need?
Unfortunately as many neighborhoods have shown, that even with gun control laws, the violence and crime do not recede when we remove guns from the hands of law-abiding citizens who obtain their weapons legally. No matter whether you live in a peaceful, safe neighborhood, or a neighborhood that is considered dangerous, all citizens should be able to exercise the right to arm themselves for personal protection or as a crime deterrent.
If Williams feels that her neighborhood is too dangerous to travel without a weapon, maybe her efforts could be put to better use through support of other Chicago South Side women, who are saying yes to the right to protect themselves and exercising their right to carry by obtaining concealed weapon permits and training in gun safety and use.
Will Cases Like This Show Activists the Importance of the Right to Carry
While situations like this can prove the importance of the right to carry for all citizens, it is not likely to change many gun activists views overnight. By showing the value of protective weapons even to the point that active anti-gun enthusiasts begin to carry them should help the public realize that without the protection of the second amendment right to carry, citizens may not have the means to protect themselves in high crime or dangerous areas.",1

The man felt the heat in his pocket but when he reached out to check, his shirt caught fire.
The administration has got the CCTV footage of Yulianto burning due to its Samsung smartphone in Semarang Indonesia.
He is standing in a store when he feels the heat on his chest and naturally reaches out to check. But as his hand touches the front pocket the smartphone inside gets fire causing an alarming situation for the man who throws his shirt away with the help of another man and saves himself.
Yulianto’s Samsung Grand Duos caught fire but he doesn’t know the exact reason besides he activated WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS all together.
His video went viral shortly after going online but people have double-sided stories to share. Some are sharing their bad experiences with the Samsung saying:
“I’ll stick to my LG. This happened to my father with his Samsung but it was in his pocket and he doesn’t use WiFi and GPS and all that on his phone. Just simply uses it for calls not even texts. He had it in his front pocket and next thing you know it started getting hot and he went quickly to take it out and threw it down and it started melting. I refuse to use another Samsung phone.”
While others are supporting the brand stating that it has the latest technology and we can forgive it for happening with S7.
To no one’s amazement, there are people who have started the Samsung vs iPhone controversy from nothing.
“I won’t fall for this. And someone had a camera handy waiting for the explosion? Samsung all the way. I won’t be caged like an animal by iPhone who thinks the world should be in a box and they must possess the keys. With Samsung, the world is yours to discover. There is so much more. The stars are the limits,” one says.
Humbly, all we care about is safety whether it is Samsung or iPhone if users are happy and safe; you have a broad market to go. Samsung lovers hope that this explosion experience would never happen again or they will have to think otherwise.
Which smartphone do you use?

There are faith elements in ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" beyond Linus' famous Bible recitation. (Image source: YouTube screenshot)
“A Charlie Brown Christmas” remains as popular today as ever. The iconic TV cartoon has been aired continually since its debut in December 1965.
It’s famously known for Linus’ reading of Luke 2:8-14 (i.e., “what Christmas is all about”):
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
Indeed such a plainspoken Bible reference was an eye-opener even in the 1960s — and certainly these days it’s not everyone’s cup of tea.
You might recall in 2015 that a school district decided to cut Linus’ Bible recitation from an elementary school’s stage version of “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” after which parents in the audience took it upon themselves to recite the passage instead.
But there’s actually much more in Charles M. Schulz’s classic animated creation with regard to faith than Linus’ reading of Scripture — they’re just not nearly as overt.
Here’s a look at some of them.
Did you catch what Linus does with his security blanket?
Pastor and author Jason Soroski noted on his blog a couple of years ago something quite interesting about Linus’ recitation of Luke 2:8-14.
His fellow characters — particularly his imposing sister Lucy — had been prodding Linus to give up his blanket for some time to no avail.
But sure enough, right after he utters the words “fear not,” down falls Linus’ blanket.
It’s not blindingly obvious because the zooming-in camera cuts out almost all of that moment — but seconds later, Linus’ blanket is indeed shown out of his hands and in a pile onstage.
“Looking at it now, it is pretty clear what Charles Schulz was saying through this, and it’s so simple it’s brilliant,” Soroski writes. “The birth of Jesus separates us from our fears. The birth of Jesus frees us from the habits we are unable (or unwilling) to break ourselves. The birth of Jesus allows us to simply drop the false security we have been grasping so tightly, and learn to trust and cling to Him instead.”
While Charlie is directing his friends in a Christmas play, he and Linus depart to get a Christmas tree to liven up the atmosphere.
But before they leave, Lucy not surprisingly offers her two cents — and not surprisingly she reveals her penchant for “a great, big, shiny aluminum Christmas tree … the biggest you can find.”
But that’s not what Charlie settles on.
In the middle of a lot full of big, gorgeous selections is a tiny, bare tree with hardly any green upon it.
Yet Charlie chooses it, saying the tree “seems to need a home.”
Linus isn’t convinced, recalling Lucy’s command: “This one doesn’t seem to fit the modern spirit,” he says.
But nevertheless Charlie Brown marches back to his friends with his chosen tree in hand — and gets hammered for it. They call Charlie “stupid” and “completely hopeless” for not getting a “good tree.”
Here’s what the prophet Isaiah wrote about the coming Messiah (53:2-3):
For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of parched ground; He has no stately form or majesty that we should look upon Him, nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him. He was despised and forsaken of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and like one from whom men hide their face He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.
Yet Charlie is undeterred by his peers’ vicious criticism. With the tree unwelcome in the auditorium, Charlies looks at it, smiles and takes it back outside. Curious, his friends follow him.
But when Charlie places an ornament atop his tree, it droops all the way down to the snow-covered ground: “I’ve killed it!” Charlie laments, adding that “everything I touch gets ruined.”
Charlie’s declaration can be viewed as akin to an acknowledgement of sin and falling short of God — and the tree’s “death” symbolic of Christ’s death for our sins, the argument adds.
But Linus steps up again, letting go of his security blanket once more and wrapping the base of the tree with it.
Then what happens? The tree Charlie “killed” is alive again and shines under the night sky. The argument follows that it’s essentially a symbol of Christ rising from the grave and his ascension into glory.
The Peanuts gang finishes up by shouting “Merry Christmas Charlie Brown!” and singing the classic carol, “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.”
Charles Schulz made no secret of his Christian faith
An Atlantic piece on the spirituality of Schulz’s cartoon creations notes:
Schulz converted to Christianity shortly after returning from a deployment in World War II, and the experience sparked a love inside of him for sacred literature. He became a voracious reader of theological commentaries, and the margins of his personal Bible were filled with hand-written notes. He was a long-time Sunday School teacher at churches in the Midwest and California, even leading one group through a study of the entire Old Testament.
So on this day, as Linus said in his reading of Luke: “Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.”

"The Seattle police officers say they chose one of the safest tools in their arsenal when they used a Taser gun against a pregnant woman resisting arrest.
Before using the device one officer asked, ""Well where do you want to do it?"" according to court papers. Another counseled, ""Well, don't do it in her stomach, do it in her thigh.""
The woman, who was 60 days from her due date, was tased three times in less than a minute.
A lawyer for the woman says the officers used excessive force.
""The officers put thousands of volts of electricity through my client causing her tremendous pain,"" says Michael F. Williams of Kirkland and Ellis. ""The concept that officers can cause tremendous pain on a suspect over a trivial offense is completely alien to our Constitution.""
On Thursday, the Supreme Court will meet behind closed doors and discuss whether to take up the issue.
The case stems from a 2004 traffic stop. Malaika Brooks was pulled over by Officer Juan Ornelas who informed her that she was going 32 miles per hour in a 20 miles per hour school zone. He issued a speeding violation.
Brooks denied that she had been speeding and said she would not sign the citation because she believed that her signature would amount to an admission of guilt. Ornelas told her that she was mistaken, but that her failure to sign would subject her to arrest under state law. She continued to refuse to sign. Eventually two other officers came to the scene, Brooks was told she was under arrest, and she was ordered out of the car. Again, she refused to get out of the car.
""I have to go to the bathroom, I am pregnant, I'm less than 60 days from having my baby,"" she told the officers. The officers told her if she did not obey orders, she would be subject to the taser device. They then conferred about using the taser on a pregnant woman.
In court papers the officers say they knew from training and experience that the use of the taser in drive-stun mode (where a charge is delivered through two blunt contact probes) would provide localized pain without risk of lasting physical injury and that it would have no adverse effect on a pregnant woman.
Eventually Officer Ornelas opened the driver's side door, and twisted Brooks' arm up behind her back . Officer Donald Jones applied the taser to Brooks' left thigh at which point she shouted and honked the horn, but continued to refuse to get out. Thirty-six seconds later he applied it to her left arm, and six seconds later he applied it to her neck.
Finally, the officers managed to drag her out and handcuff her. She was seen by a doctor before she was taken to King County Jail. Brooks was eventually convicted for failing to sign a speeding ticket.
Her healthy baby girl was born in January 2005 and she sued the police officers for excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable search and seizure.
Last year a federal appeals court sided with Brooks in ruling that her claims constituted a constitutional violation.
""A reasonable fact-finder could conclude, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Brooks, that the officers' use of force was unreasonable and therefore constitutionally excessive,"" the majority of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held. The court said her alleged offenses were minor, she did not pose an immediate threat to the safety of the officers and that the officers inflicted extreme pain on her while she was seven months pregnant.
Although the court found a constitutional violation on the facts presented to it, it ruled that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity from Brooks' constitutional claim because the law was ""not sufficiently clear at the time of the incident.""
Chief Judge Alex Kozinski disagreed strongly with the majority's conclusion that the use of the Taser gun qualified as excessive force.
""Bull Pucky!"" Kozinski wrote in his 2011 partial dissent. He pointed out that Brooks had been resisting arrest and that the officers had chosen the safest tool in their arsenal to deal with the woman's defiance.
""Having already warned Brooks that he'd tase her if she wouldn't comply, Jones tried the lightest possible application of the device, pressing it against her clothed thigh for five seconds,"" Kozinski wrote. He said the final result was ""utterly positive,"" the officers had defused the situation, Brooks suffered only minor scars, and her daughter was born healthy.
He chastised the majority for counting the seconds between tasings and finding that the rapid succession provided no time for her to recover. ""Although Brooks claims she was 'scared' and 'in shock"" after the initial tasing, she also admits that she began yelling for help and honking her horn"" with a ""deliberate decision to continue her defiance,"" Kozinski wrote.
Both Brooks and the officers have appealed the case to the Supreme Court. Brooks wants the court to find that the officers should not be immune from her suit, and the officers want the justices to overrule the lower court on the constitutional violation.
The officers say they need guidance from the Supreme Court. In court papers their lawyers write that the appeals court ""abolished application of a useful pain compliance technique without describing why the technique was unreasonable and without evaluating or even discussing alternatives that the officers could have used to reasonable effect their lawful duties.""
Each side cites a 1989 Supreme Court decision regarding the use of excessive force that said such cases should be analyzed using an ""objective reasonableness standard."" The court held that ""the 'reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.""
But experts think the court might be reluctant to take up the taser case.
""This case looks very dramatic on its facts,"" says Robert Weisberg of Stanford Law School. ""But that doesn't mean it's a very good case for the court to take."" Weisberg notes that both parties have filed petitions asking for the court to step in and that there is no decision below imposing damages.
""The Supreme Court might say 'This is procedurally too weird a situation to be the right vehicle for us to say something about Tasers,' "" Weisberg says. ""I think the court is likely to view Tasers as a legitimate means of inflicting non lethal force. If so, it may find it impractical to declare a constitutional rule about when Taser use is okay and when it isn't because the legitimacy of Taser use may just depend on the situation. If so, the court's view might be, 'we don't want to treat Tasers differently from other non lethal means of force' therefore it's not desirable to have a rule for Tasers. The rules governing Tasers will be the general rules governing excessive force and therefore we don't want to make a constitutional doctrine out of Tasers. ""
He says in general that lower courts have tended to defer to police on the use of Tasers, but there have been a few cases where a person has won a lawsuit against police, where the Taser use was arguably unnecessary and where it happened to inflict serious harm.
Lisa Kern Griffin of Duke Law agrees that the court may not step in to take this case.
""The issue is not presented well in this particular case, if they wanted to engage with new technologies for both the apprehension of suspects and crowd control, both of which have been in the news and in the courts lately, they will look for a case that presents the issue at a higher level of generality and has significance beyond the particular facts of the tasering that happened in this case, "" she says.",0
"When hurricanes or rivers swollen by heavy rains send floodwaters into businesses, many owners are left with steep financial losses because they didn't have flood insurance.
Standard business insurance doesn't cover flood damage, something many owners may not realize when they buy a policy. Flood insurance, which is regulated by the federal government, must be purchased separately through a broker or an insurance company.
Many owners don't buy flood insurance because of its cost or the belief that they don't need it. In high-risk areas, annual premiums can run into the thousands of dollars and rise by double-digit percentages each year. Owners in low-lying areas or near oceans and rivers often know they're at risk, but many can't afford the premiums.
Just because a company is located far from the coast or a body of water doesn't mean it's immune from the possibility of flooding. Heavy rains like those that fell on Houston following Hurricane Harvey last month can also cause flooding that can be covered by flood insurance. So can melting snow and blocked storm drains. Businesses without flood insurance won't be covered.

During a hurricane, damage caused by water pouring into a hole in a wind-torn roof is covered, but not the destruction caused by floodwaters that come in through a window or door. More than half the businesses and homes in the Houston flooded during and after Harvey were estimated to be uninsured for flood losses, according to CoreLogic, a research company.
Flood insurance is mandatory for some companies, those that are in high-risk areas and that have mortgages from lenders regulated or insured by the federal government.
You can find information online about flood insurance, including maps showing an area's flood risk, at the National Flood Insurance Program website. The Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, also has information here. Some state and local governments, particularly those in high-risk areas, also have information on their websites.

"Data breaches. Identity theft. Bank fraud. Every week, we read a fearsome new headline about cybercrime. Reputable services fall victim to anonymous hackers. Ransomware holds random computer user’s files hostage. And what about those websites that track your every move, targeting you with personalized advertisements?
Maybe you’ve considered the unthinkable: removing yourself from the Internet.
Well, there’s bad news and good news. You can’t erase yourself completely from the digital universe. Courts and government agencies have been posting public records online since the mid-1990s. Your motor vehicle records, voter files, property tax assessments, professional licenses, and court files are all on the digital books, and they’re not going anywhere.
Tip in a Tip: If you’d like to see what’s online about you or someone you know,read more on how to do a free background check.
The good news: You can remove a lot of online information, significantly reducing your digital footprint. How can you do it? Here are several ways to effectively delete yourself from the Internet.
You probably have more online accounts than you realize – most of us do. We sign up for all sorts of services, from Netflix and Amazon to Groupon and Twitter. Even if you haven’t downloaded an app in years, Apple, Facebook or Google still possesses a lot of private information, along with so many other virtual services.
If you really want to terminate your Internet presence, you’ll want to eliminate these accounts, especially the ones you don’t use anymore.
This may sound like an uphill battle since each service has its own policies and deactivation process. But the easiest method is Account Killer, a website that provides direct links to your most popular accounts and instructions how to wipe the slate clean.
Maybe you just want to clean up your digital tracks. Does the idea of Google knowing your every search creep you out? There's a way to erase everything you’ve ever searched for on Google.
If you’re not careful, you’re probably exposing more of your life than you want to on Facebook. Certainly, you can delete your Facebook account. But if all you need is a Facebook break, there is the option to deactivate your account.

You’ll probably find this creepy. Are you sitting down? Okay: Almost anyone can learn your phone number, home address, and criminal record in a matter of minutes. All they have to do is pay a little money to a “data broker,” also known as a “people-search site.” Often, the information is free.
Primary data brokers like Intelius collect information from public records. Secondary data brokers, like Spokeo, aggregate information from primary brokers and usually add data collected from social networks and other online sources.
Letting this information float around on the internet can be dangerous, especially if you attract internet ""trolls."" A troll might nab your name, phone number, address, or online accounts, and the resulting harassment could go on for years.
If you want to have your information removed from data broker sites, you need to contact them and request to opt out. How to remove yourself from people search sites.
This is a very big step. Most people will turn back at this point, deciding that Internet abstinence is not for them. Email is still the most popular method of communication in the world, and email addresses are used for all kinds digital transactions, including online banking.
It’s not enough to just stop using email. If you leave an account open and fail to monitor it, your account could get hacked without you even realizing. At the same time, each email server is different, and closing your account varies from system to system. I’ll focus on the two biggest companies out there.
Gmail is the most popular service out there, with more than 1 billion users. Before you close your account, make sure you’ve downloaded and saved all of your old data, because you never know when this archive of old correspondences might become important.
Login and visit the ""Account Preferences"" page, then Delete Products >> Gmail. Follow the instructions, and finally hit ""Delete Gmail.” Read more details and instructions.
If you deleted your Gmail and later feel weird about it, you still have a chance to reactivate your account. According to Google, if you deleted your account ""recently,"" you ""might be able to recover your old emails."" However, it does not state how long this option is available, so be sure before deleting this account.
Yahoo is still a popular choice, despite widespread data breaches. Go to the ""Terminating your Yahoo account"" page. Read the information under ""Before continuing, please consider the following information."" Confirm your password. If you forgot your password, you can recover it with the Yahoo Sign-in Helper.

But remember, if you do close your Yahoo account, you will not be able to use services associated with it, such as Flickr and Tumblr. So be sure this is what you want before closing it.
Giving up the Internet also means giving up online banking, online shopping, and online photo-sharing. Most of us are accustomed to web-based conveniences. It has become so intertwined in our three-dimensional lives that we can’t actually imagine living without it.

Roy Moore’s first accuser details events that led to public accusation: ‘Didn’t go looking for this’
Leigh Corfman, Roy Moore's first accuser,
details how she arrived at coming out publicly with allegations of sexual misconduct. ""The Washington Post sought me out. I didn't go looking for this. It fell in my lap,"" she said. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
Leigh Corfman, first accuser of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, spoke out about the events that led up to her coming out publicly with claims of sexual misconduct against Moore.
Corfman revealed that she didn’t “go looking for this” during the Monday airing of NBC’s “Today,” and detailedwhy and how she decided to go publicabout her alleged encounter with Moore in 1979.Corfman said that Moore took her to his house when she was 14 years old, where he undressed her, groped her, and placed her hand on his underwear.
What did she say?
Corfman said that she had previously decided several times not to go public with her story, but she was convinced when The Washington Post approached her with what appeared to be an investigative story. Corfman said that she only agreed to speak with the Post ifthe newspaper wasable to locate other alleged victims.
“The Washington Post sought me out. I didn’t go looking for this. It fell in my lap,” she told host Savannah Guthrie. “It literally fell in my lap.”
She added, “I had to make a decision and I told them that at that time — the reporters who were all just wonderful to me — that if they found additional people, that I would tell my story.”
Corfman, 53, revealed that she had told other people about the allegations —namely family and friends.
“I did tell people,” Corfman admitted. “My family knew, family friends knew, my friends knew. I spent a lot of time every time he came up railing against, you know, him and what he had done to me when I was 14 years old.”
Corfman revealed that on one occasion, she planned to confront Moore over the reported misconduct.
“I was a single parent and when you’re in that situation you do everything you can to protect your own,” Corfman explained. “And I sat in the courthouse parking lot and thought, you know, ‘I’m going in. I’m going to confront him.’ And this is about 2000, 2001. And I wanted to walk into his office and say, ‘Hey remember me. You need to knock this stuff off. You need to go public.’ My children were small so I didn’t do it.”
Corfman on a second occasion said that she decided not to go public when her children —who, by this point, were aware of their mother’s circumstance —were “afraid” for their story to come out.
“The second time, I actually sat down with my children who were then junior high and elementary school, and I told them a high overview and gave them the ability to make the decision,” Corfman said. “They were afraid that with all their social connections they would be castigated in their groups. And we decided together that we wouldn’t do it at that time.”
What did she say about going public with these allegations?
Corfman expressed her pleasure at being able to inspire others to come out with their own similar stories.
Corfman explained, “Here’s the beauty of what has happened: The support has been amazing. Women and men have come forward to tell their stories that have never had the ability to do so because of my courageous actions.”
When Guthrie showed a photo of Corfman when she was 14 years old, Corfman said, “She sure did have a lot of promise ahead of her. And she didn’t deserve to have a 32-year-old man prey upon her.”
Moore, now 70, and his campaign haveclaimedthat the allegations are fabricated.

"December 1965– While working on an ulcer drug, James Schlatter, a chemist at G. D. Searle, accidentally discovers aspartame, a substance that is 180 times sweeter than sugar yet has no calories.
Spring 1967– Searle begins the safety tests on aspartame that are necessary for applying for FDA approval of food additives.
Fall 1967– Dr. Harold Waisman, a biochemist at the University of Wisconsin, conducts aspartame safety tests on infant monkeys on behalf of the Searle Company. Of the seven monkeys that were being fed aspartame mixed with milk, one dies and five others have grand mal seizures.
November 1970– Cyclamate, the reigning low-calorie artificial sweetener — is pulled off the market after some scientists associate it with cancer. Questions are also raised about safety of saccharin, the only other artificial sweetener on the market, leaving the field wide open for aspartame.
December 18, 1970– Searle Company executives lay out a “Food and Drug Sweetener Strategy’ that they feel will put the FDA into a positive frame of mind about aspartame. An internal policy memo describes psychological tactics the company should use to bring the FDA into a subconscious spirit of participation” with them on aspartame and get FDA regulators into the “habit of saying, “Yes”.”
Spring 1971– Neuroscientist Dr. John Olney (whose pioneering work with monosodium glutamate was responsible for having it removed from baby foods) informs Searle that his studies show that aspartic acid (one of the ingredients of aspartame) caused holes in the brains of infant mice. One of Searle’s own researchers confirmed Dr. Olney’s findings in a similar study.
February 1973– After spending tens of millions of dollars conducting safety tests, the G. D. Searle Company applies for FDA approval and submits over 100 studies they claim support aspartame’s safety.
March 5, 1973– One of the first FDA scientists to review the aspartame safety data states that “the information provided (by Searle) is inadequate to permit an evaluation of the potential toxicity of aspartame”. She says in her report that in order to be certain that aspartame is safe, further clinical tests are needed.
May 1974– Attorney, Jim Turner (consumer advocate who was instrumental in getting cyclamate taken off the market) meets with Searle representatives to discuss Dr. Olney’s 1971 study which showed that aspartic acid caused holes in the brains of infant mice.
July 26, 1974– The FDA grants aspartame its first approval for restricted use in dry foods.
August 1974– Jim Turner and Dr. John Olney file the first objections against aspartame’s approval.
March 24, 1976– Turner and Olney’s petition triggers an FDA investigation of the laboratory practices of aspartame’s manufacturer, G. D. Searle. The investigation finds Searle’s testing procedures shoddy, full of inaccuracies and “manipulated” test data. The investigators report they “had never seen anything as bad as Searle’s testing.”
January 10, 1977– The FDA formally requests the U. S. Attorney’s office to begin grand jury proceedings to investigate whether indictments should be filed against Searle for knowingly misrepresenting findings and “concealing material facts and making false statements” in aspartame safety tests. This is the first time in the FDA’s history that they request a criminal investigation of a manufacturer.
January 26, 1977– While the grand jury probe is underway, Sidley & Austin, the law firm representing Searle, begins job negotiations with the U. S. Attorney in charge of the investigation, Samuel Skinner.
March 8, 1977– G. D. Searle hires prominent Washington insider Donald Rumsfeld as the new CEO to try to turn the beleaguered company around. A former Member of Congress and Secretary of Defense in the Ford Administration, Rumsfeld brings in several of his Washington cronies as top management.
July 1, 1977– Samuel Skinner leaves the U. S. Attorney’s office and takes a job with Searle’s law firm. (see Jan. 26th)
August 1, 1977– The Bressler Report, compiled by FDA investigators and headed by Jerome Bressler, is released. The report finds that 98 of the 196 animals died during one of Searle’s studies and weren’t autopsied until later dates, in some cases over one year after death. Many other errors and inconsistencies are noted. For example, a rat was reported alive, then dead, then alive, then dead again; a mass, a uterine polyp, and ovarian neoplasms were found in animals but not reported or diagnosed in Searle’s reports.
December 8, 1977– U. S. Attorney Skinner’s withdrawal and resignation stalls the Searle grand jury investigation for so long that the statue of limitations on the aspartame charges runs out. The grand jury investigation is dropped.
June 1, 1979– The FDA established a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) to rule on safety issues surrounding NutraSweet.
September 30, 1980– The Public Board of Inquiry concludes NutraSweet should not be approved pending further investigations of brain tumors in animals. The board states it “has not been presented with proof of reasonable certainty that aspartame is safe for use as a food additive.”
January 1981– Donald Rumsfeld, CEO of Searle, states in a sales meeting that he is going to make a big push to get aspartame approved within the year. Rumsfeld says he will use his political pull in Washington, rather than scientific means, to make sure it gets approved.
January 21, 1981– Ronald Reagan is sworn in as President of the United States. Reagan’s transition team, which includes Donald Rumsfeld, CEO of G. D. Searle, hand picks Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes Jr. to be the new FDA Commissioner.
March, 1981– An FDA commissioner’s panel is established to review issues raised by the Public Board of Inquiry.
May 19, 1981– Three of six in-house FDA scientists who were responsible for reviewing the brain tumor issues, Dr. Robert Condon, Dr. Satya Dubey, and Dr. Douglas Park, advise against approval of NutraSweet, stating on the record that the Searle tests are unreliable and not adequate to determine the safety of aspartame.
July 15, 1981– In one of his first official acts, Dr. Arthur Hayes Jr., the new FDA commissioner, overrules the Public Board of Inquiry, ignores the recommendations of his own internal FDA team and approves NutraSweet for dry products. Hayes says that aspartame has been shown to be safe for its’ proposed uses and says few compounds have withstood such detailed testing and repeated close scrutiny.
October 15, 1982– The FDA announces that Searle has filed a petition that aspartame be approved as a sweetener in carbonated beverages and other liquids.
July 1, 1983– The National Soft Drink Association (NSDA) urges the FDA to delay approval of aspartame for carbonated beverages pending further testing because aspartame is very unstable in liquid form. When liquid aspartame is stored in temperatures above 85 degrees Fahrenheit, it breaks down into DKP and formaldehyde, both of which are known toxins.
July 8, 1983– The National Soft Drink Association drafts an objection to the final ruling which permits the use of aspartame in carbonated beverages and syrup bases and requests a hearing on the objections. The association says that Searle has not provided responsible certainty that aspartame and its’ degradation products are safe for use in soft drinks.
August 8, 1983– Consumer Attorney, Jim Turner of the Community Nutrition Institute and Dr. Woodrow Monte, Arizona State University’s Director of Food Science and Nutritional Laboratories, file suit with the FDA objecting to aspartame approval based on unresolved safety issues.
September, 1983– FDA Commissioner Hayes resigns under a cloud of controversy about his taking unauthorized rides aboard a General Foods jet. (General foods is a major customer of NutraSweet) Burson-Marsteller, Searle’s public relation firm (which also represented several of NutraSweet’s major users), immediately hires Hayes as senior scientific consultant.

"Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.
Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.
Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.
By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.
Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.
Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.
Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.
Turn the lights down. If you’ve got absolutely no time to get ready for guests, you can try this last-ditch technique: Turn the lights down low, or close the blinds. The darker the room, the less dirt your guests will see. The darkness will hide many of your sins.",0
"Forget spraying pesticidesonyour food, now they’ll be genetically engineered to beinyour food, thanks to Monsanto’s latest quiet approval via the US Environmental Protection Agency.
The EPA just told Monsanto they could go ahead and bypass spraying our crops with carcinogenic chemicals like Round Up and just go ahead and breed them right into the crops themselves. Using a process called RNA interference, Monsanto’s RNAi plant will supposedly kill pesky rootworms when they come along to chomp on them- but what else will these genetically modified crops do to beneficial bugs, the soil, and human health? The EPA has no idea, because they haven’t done a single trial on RNAi-altered crops.
Nonetheless, the EPAquietlygave Monsanto a Get-Out-of-Jail-Free card by allowing them to move forward with their genetically modified corn strain. Some are calling this a genetic weapon, in its infancy. Others are concerned that RNAi will have ramifications for the biosphere that – just like all of Monsanto’s other products – don’t come to light for years to come.
For instance,the National Honey Bee Advisory Boardsaidin comments submitted to the E. P.A. before a “meeting” in which this controversial genetic technology was to be reviewed,
To attempt to use this technology at this current stage of understanding would be more nave than our use of DDT in the 1950s.
While the corn rootworm is one of the most expensive pests in agriculture it is having a hey day because corn – the genetically modified kind – is thenumber one crop in the U. S.
GM corn has taken over thousands of other possible crops we could be growing, in field after field of mono-cropped, industrial agriculturally influenced support of the Standard American Diet –up to 70 percentof whichcontain corn products(high fructose corn syrup, corn solids, etc.)
We alsoheavily subsidize genetically modified cornto be used not as food, but as agasoline additive. Ethanol accounts for a few thousand acres of those GM corn crops we’re growing, too.
Another big problem with Monsanto getting a green light on this crop is that RNAi is a form ofgene silencing. What is true for petunias isn’t necessarily true for people. If we were to silence the gene that makes a pigment in a flower so it can attract bees, for example, this could end up in our own bodies, silencing our own genetic make-up in ways we don’t expect.
Regalado, one researcher who helped discover RNAi describes it this way,
The cells of plants and animals carry their instructions in the form of DNA. To make a protein, the sequence of genetic letters in each gene gets copied into matching strands of RNA, which then float out of the nucleus to guide the protein-making machinery of the cell. RNA interference, or gene silencing, is a way to destroy specific RNA messages so that a particular protein is not made.
Might not an alteration to the foods we eat, also have the possibility ofaffecting our own DNA? We know now that proteins are even more important than some scientists previously assumed for signaling certain instructions for genes to carry out their intended purpose.
The very sameinstitutions studying RNAiwill admit that protein alteration can epigeneticallycreateor destroydisease.
If Big Ag Giants Monsanto, and Dow (cooperating to make this RNAi corn a reality) continue in their successful attempts to getDvSnf7 corn (to be called SmartStax Pro) into our food supply, we have no idea what mayhem might ensue.

"America is facing a big problem within the NFL; namely, the increasing and seemingly constant protests of our national anthem that’s leaving many fans furious and creating controversy. Football Sunday has turned into a day of political discord instead of a moment to break from the weekly hustle and stress. Everyone seems to have something to say about it if you take a look at social media, but few are offering solutions, so we got one for you.
First and foremost, most of us grew up being told there were two things you should never enter a discussion about at work— religion and politics. Apparently, this isn’t something the entitled brats of the NFL who are taking a knee or cowardly hiding in the locker room as a form of protest were taught. Let’s be clear here, those overpaid players are on the job during their protest, representing their company and employer.
Your place of employment isn’t where you should be staging any protest, especially a political one. You can protest all you want on your own time, but if any of us common folk pulled a political stunt while on the job, during our workday, we’d be fired. If we’re being honest, most of us would be fired for so much less. Every American is free to protest, but when you are paid to work, you should do your job. That applies to the overpaid man-child who gets to play games for a living.
Although this seems to be common sense to those of us who are basically paying their salaries with our support of their teams, the owners and coaches don’t seem to get it or hear our message. You know what? As much as we hate it, that’s their right. A business owner in America has every right to run their business how they see fit. And, the owners within the NFL are letting us know where they stand— or in this case, sit. So, it’s time to stop talking about it and do something about it instead.
They have the right to run their business according to their beliefs, just like those of us on the right said Christian bakers should. So, what’s the solution? Well, in the case of Christian bakers, what did we suggest? We told those who didn’t like it to take their business elsewhere. I know what you’re thinking; namely, where’s that when it’s becoming nearly the entire NFL and every team? Well, we have the perfect solution not just for you but for another population within our country that deserves our support.
Like we said, every individual has the right to decide whether they will stand for the anthem. Unfortunately for those who don’t seem to mind infuriating their fans, those fans also have the right not to watch this “glorified, watered down kids game that’s played for millions of dollars,” as a dear friend so eloquently put it. So, let’s quit watching, quit buying their merchandise and tickets, and quit supporting their sponsors, but more importantly, let’s put that money to better use.
It’s time to support our future and our communities, and guess what, I bet your community has its own football team. Go watch your high school sports. Support your local athletics clubs. These kids play with heart and a true love for the game rather than for a paycheck. They are our future. Let’s get involved there, show our support there, and teach them the values that the whiny NFL brats with their big salaries don’t seem to get.
At our public school, parents and teachers do a “tailgate” party for the kids, bringing good food and giving us a chance to connect. Parents, students, and teachers come together and get to know one another. It creates a sense of community that you aren’t going to get sitting in front of your television watching the big game on Sunday. No blood boiling and Monday morningmoaning about the unwanted agendas shoved down our throats.Doesn’t that seem like time better spent?
Or, we can just keep complaining about it as yet another snickering sports-star decides to join the ranks of the endless list of protesters within the NFL. That’s really changed things for us thus far, hasn’t it? Actions speak louder than words, and it’s time to act or stop complaining. They’ve shown us where they sit. Let’s show them where we stand. The bleachers of our local high school on Friday night sounds like the perfect place to start.",1
"The Capital Weather Gang blog provides the most insightful and entertaining weather coverage available for the metropolitan Washington, D. C. region. Our team of forecasters and writers not only tells you what’s going on with local weather, but why it’s happening, and what you can expect for specific upcoming events and locations of interest. We’ll explain what causes various weather phenomena, warn you about bad (and good) weather on the horizon, and during severe weather or emergencies our blog will be an up-to-the-minute resource. And we’ll give you facts and figures you won’t get from the average weather report.
The blog is designed to be interactive, and we hope you’ll join the conversation by posting comments, telling storm stories, asking questions or reporting observations in real-time. In addition, the site features:
To learn more, read the FAQ below and check out our Meet the Gang page. And don’t hesitate to Ask the Gang those weather questions you’ve always thought about but never asked.
Where did Capital Weather Gang come from?
In 2002, with a passion for weather and a master’s degree in meteorology under his belt, Jason Samenow developed the idea of a weather Web site focused on the DC area. Launched in 2003, CapitalWeather.com was a set of useful weather links and occasional forecast commentary before, during and after significant weather events. The site quickly attracted a small following of family, friends and weather enthusiasts.
At the same time, blogs were springing up all over the Internet. Blogs (short for weblogs) have taken on various forms and purposes, but at their core they have served as a way to communicate information in a timely manner while providing a mechanism for users to interact with each other and the author. The blog concept fit perfectly with Jason’s vision to create a site where visitors could learn about changing weather conditions and interact with weather experts. With the help of Jamie Jones, an eager computer science major at Jason’s alma mater, the University of Virginia, CapitalWeather.com became what is believed to be the world’s first local weather blog in February 2004.
Since then, Jason has assembled a talented and diverse team of forecasters and photographers, most of whom have degrees in meteorology. In January 2008, CapitalWeather.com moved to washingtonpost.com and became the Capital Weather Gang blog. The blog targets both the general public and weather enthusiasts, providing the most insightful and entertaining weather information available for the metropolitan D. C. area, including news, analysis, local forecasts, features, photographs and data. It also offers lots of interactive opportunities for readers.
You all use the word “team” a lot? Why is that so important?
Capital Weather Gang forecasters work as a team to provide the most accurate weather forecast possible. During routine weather, each forecaster tries to build on the previous forecaster’s prediction, with the goal of honing in closer and closer to the correct forecast. Leading up to and during significant weather events, such as winter storms, Capital Weather Gang forecasters carefully review and discuss all of the data available before presenting a “Team Forecast.” We believe a consensus forecast is often more accurate than that by any one individual.
Can’t I get my weather forecast from the local TV news, the Weather Channel, the radio, or from Web sites like weather.com and AccuWeather.com? What makes Capital Weather Gang different?
To get the weather on TV or radio, you have to do so on that station’s schedule. At Capital Weather Gang, accurate and detailed weather information for the DC area is always at your fingertips, and is updated whenever changing models and weather conditions warrant. Also, TV and radio stations don’t typically offer the kind of access to their forecast team that Capital Weather Gang does. We encourage visitors to comment or ask questions, and those who do usually receive an expert response in a timely manner.
Unlike the computer-generated forecasts found at most traditional weather Web sites, our forecasts are prepared by human beings who know the Washington area and have experience forecasting here. Thanks to our local knowledge and experience, and the flexibility of our format, we’re able to offer more forecast details than other Web sites. We try to paint a picture of the day and describe how the weather will affect your life — whether you’re going to the supermarket, a festival on the Mall or a Nationals game. In addition, different levels of detail allow those who wish to dig deeper into our content to find out why the weather is doing what it’s doing.
Do you make your own forecasts, or are you just repeating what the National Weather Service says?
Yes, we absolutely make our own forecasts (that meteorology training would’ve been quite a waste if we didn’t). As is the case of any weather forecasting outlet, most of the raw data we use to construct the forecast comes from the National Weather Service, which operates several computer weather models. But it’s up to us to interpret the data and leverage our local experience to come up with as accurate and detailed of a forecast as possible.
Nothing at all. We think the National Weather Service does a fantastic job, and is an invaluable asset to the nation’s society and economy. But the forecast it provides for public consumption is limited in nature, in part due to its specific mission as a government agency. At Capital Weather Gang, we strive to include as many forecast details as possible, though still presented in a concise fashion. For example, when model data is conclusive enough, we’ll pinpoint the most likely timing of rain or snow (e.g., not until after the morning commute, or between 4 and 9 p.m.). Also, we focus on communicating the uncertainty associated with a given forecast, and whether there is more than one possible scenario.
Our forecast area includes the District and generally areas within a two-county radius of the District. However, note that for forecast highs and lows, our forecast will tend to mostly capture locations within 10-15 miles of the Beltway because it would be unrealistic for us to try to capture some of the extremes in northern Montgomery, western Loudoun, northern Fauquier and Frederick counties (these areas can be appreciably cooler), for example, in a single forecast.
For major storms affecting the region, we will attempt to expand our coverage to provide general information for central Virginia, Baltimore and northern Maryland, Md./Va./W. Va mountains, and/or Maryland and Delaware beaches.
Not every forecast is a sure bet. Sometimes the various computer models that we look at when making a forecast are in complete agreement, allowing us to predict with high confidence. Sometimes they differ widely from each other, in which case our confidence may be low. Still other times, guidance from the models combined with our experience and even gut instinct warrant a confidence somewhere in-between. Rather than pretend we know exactly what’s going to happen when we really don’t, the forecast confidence indicators are an easy way for us to communicate the uncertainty of a forecast.
Generally speaking, here’s how you should interpret the different levels:
* Medium-High: Overall forecast is sound, but minor variations are possible.
* Medium: We think we’re on the right track, but the forecast details are still taking shape.
* Low-Medium: This is our best guess, but don’t hold us to it.
We have developed a rating system for classifying the impact of winter storms that affect the D. C. area.

What do the SchoolCast apples and FedCast Capitol Domesmean?The following impact forecasts are issued leading up to and during winter storms:
Do your homework. You’re probably having school.
50/50 chance for school. Good chance of at least a delay or early dismissal. Do your homework now, so you don’t have to sweat it later.
It’s probably safe to blow off the homework, but your day off will be more enjoyable if you do it now.
Most or all area schools are officially closed.
Expect to report to work on time
Greater than 90% chance of unscheduled leave policy, delay, or early closing. 50% or less chance of shutdown.
Greater than 75% chance of shutdown. Near certainty of unscheduled leave policy.
What is the Storm Threat Level?
Our Storm Threat Level graphic is aimed at promoting storm preparedness on days when thunderstorms are possible. The three levels are:
When does the Snow Lover’s Crystal Ball appear?
The Snow Lover’s Crystal Ball appears when the potential exists for accumulating snow beyond 24 to 36 hours. It includes the predicted timing, probability and potential impact of the snow, as well as commentary that examines the various scenarios that might occur.
What does the Nice Day Sun mean?
The Nice Day Sun is awarded for days that are expected to meet the following criteria:
* Probability of rain less than 20%
A confidence of at least “Medium-High” is required for those days awarded the Nice Day Sun. Thus, it is rarely given for forecasts beyond 48 hours.
What’s the difference between partly sunny and partly cloudy?
Different forecasters and forecast outlets have different answers to this question. Here’s what we think makes the most sense: They both mean the same thing — a mix of sun and clouds. We tend to use partly sunny for daytime forecasts and, obviously, partly cloudy for nighttime. Sometimes we’ll use partly cloudy during the day to highlight a change from sunnier to cloudier skies.
What does a 40% chance of rain really mean?
Simply put, it means that any location in the forecast area has a 40% chance of receiving measurable rain during the forecast period. In other words, statistically, for every 10 times we forecast a 40% chance of rain where you live, you should receive measurable rain four times.
Does Capital Weather Gang post on climate change and other politically charged issues? Is Capital Weather Gang a partisan blog?
The weather, and how it affects the daily lives of those living in and visiting the DC area, will always be our main focus. But we would be remiss to not comment from time to time on climate change and other politically charged issues related to the environment (this is Washington, after all). Capital Weather Gang is officially non-partisan. However, its writers may offer opinions on policies adopted or championed by a particular public figure or political party. These opinions are those held expressly by the writer and do not represent an official position of Capital Weather Gang.
What’s the difference between a watch, warning and advisory?
The National Weather Service issues watches, warnings and advisories, which we report here at Capital Weather Gang, for significant and hazardous weather including winter storms, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods and excessive heat.
A watch means that the potential exists for significant and hazardous weather, while a warning means that significant and hazardous weather is imminent or already occurring. An advisory indicates that inclement weather is expected to cause a significant inconvenience, but not serious enough to warrant a warning.
The criteria required to issue a watch, warning or advisory is different for different parts of the country. Definitions for the D. C. metro area can be found here.
Where can I get past weather data for the D. C. area?
Past weather data for the D. C. area is available at the National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington Web site. Also, at Weather Underground, past weather data can be obtained for the nearest reporting station through zip code, airport or city queries — enter your location of interest at the top of the page and scroll down to “History and Almanac.” Weather data for official purposes can be obtained from the National Climatic Data Center.",0
"Remember when we used to think that dietary fat was bad? We believed that “fat makes you fat,” but now know that obesity is more complex than just overeating a single nutrient. It’s amazing how much research now exists on the benefits of fat. It can help quell inflammation, assist with weight control and protect against heart disease, diabetes and cognitive decline.
But before you dive headfirst into a vat of lard, recognize that the type of fat you choose matters. Your best bets are foods that are high in monounsaturated and omega-3 polyunsaturated fats — especially when these foods replace items that are high in trans fat or sugar.
You can get more of these beneficial fats in your diet by adding fish, nuts, seeds, oil and avocado to your meals. Here are four of my favorite fat-rich foods:
A one-ounce serving of almonds ( cup) has six grams of protein, 13 grams of “good” monounsaturated fat, and is a source of fiber, vitamin E and magnesium. Almonds are a perfect snack, especially when they replace less nutritious alternatives like chips or pastries. This was highlighted in a recent study published in the Journal of Nutrition.
In a randomized controlled trial, researchers compared adults who snacked daily on 1.5 ounces of almonds or one banana muffin (both snacks had the same number of calories).
[Confused by the many yogurt options? We can help you sort them out.]
“The group that snacked on almonds had lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, but elevated levels of good alpha-1 HDL cholesterol,” explains Penny Kris-Etherton, one of the researchers. Alpha-1 HDL is the form of cholesterol that’s known to be most protective against heart disease. So snack on a handful of almonds, or sprinkle them on salad, soup or yogurt.
I’m head over heels for this unctuous, silky fruit (yup, technically it’s a very large berry). In addition to being high in fiber and monounsaturated fat, avocados also contain lutein, a plant pigment that provides their greenish-yellow hue.
In a recent study, Elizabeth Johnson and colleagues at Tufts University looked at how lutein in avocado can positively affect cognition in older adults. They compared adults aged 50+ whose diets included one avocado per day vs. a control group, and learned that avocado eaters had increased lutein levels, significantly improved memory and better problem-solving skills.
“Higher levels of lutein are related to better visual and cognitive function,” Johnson says.
And while there’s lutein in leafy greens too, it isn’t as well-absorbed by the body because greens contain little fat. “The monounsaturated fat in avocados increases absorption of fat-soluble lutein, and it positively influences lutein’s transport into tissue,” explains Johnson.
Add cubed avocado to salad or atop chili; blend it into soups and smoothies; or dip into some guacamole. Avocado oil is great too.
This liquid gold is a staple in most kitchens, and for good reason. Filled with monounsaturated fats, it’s recommended for heart health. In fact, consuming three tablespoons (about 50 ML) of olive oil per day has been shown to reduce the risk of developing heart disease by 37 percent.
It has also been linked to fighting inflammation, assisting with better cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and helping with weight maintenance (that’s right, folks, fat doesn’t make you fat).
Another perk: olive oil helps your body absorb the fat-soluble vitamins and antioxidants in vegetables, so it’s a perfect salad dressing ingredient.
About 65 percent of the fat in chia seeds is an omega-3 fat called alpha linolenic acid (ALA). It’s an essential fat that we need to get from food because the body cannot make it. Chia is the highest food source of omega-3 fat.
[Got 10 minutes? You can do this workout.]
Research shows that the omega-3 fats from fish have the strongest health benefit, but the plant-based ones have some potential too. ALA may protect the brain against strokes, and is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Studies on chia seeds show that they can help reduce blood pressure, control appetite and regulate blood sugar.
These interesting seeds soak up liquid to form a gel, so they’re a great addition to oatmeal, yogurt or pudding. They can be used as an egg replacer in baking, or to thicken soups and gravies.
In addition to their stellar health benefits, these fatty foods have another bonus — they enhance the flavor of your meals. Yep, fat carries flavor (dry toast, anyone? No?) and adds mouth feel. I love when something that tastes great is also good for you.
But remember, researchers use high amounts of fatty foods in their studies. You’re not part of a clinical trial and do not need to consume these amounts. If you add a whole avocado and three tablespoons of oil to your daily diet, you’ll get too many calories. So be practical. When you have salad, make the dressing with olive oil. Use avocado instead of butter on your sandwich. Snack on almonds rather than chips. Small changes add up to a healthier overall diet.

There is nothing more pleasant than entering an environment where a rich fragrance abounds. A curious fact that many perhaps did not know is that, the odors influence our mood. So, being in a place with a good smell, we feel relaxed.
However, if the smell is strong and unpleasant, this will make us feel uncomfortable and even annoying. Unfortunately, we can not always keep our house with a very pleasant smell.
Sometimes, after chopping onion or fixing the fish, a strong odor can be enclosed. This nasty smell can not be eliminated with almost nothing. No matter how we open the windows, turn on the fan or do other things, the smell does not go away.
In desperation, many housewives go to the supermarket to buy air fresheners. However, all they do is hide the smell. After a while, when its effect has passed, the bad smell reappears. It is at that moment when we are about to throw in the towel. But that does not have to be your case.
Today we want to show you how to prepare a homemade flavoring much more effective than any other. Spraying it in your house will make it stay with a rich smell for a long time. You will notice that even your guests are delighted with the aroma. You will see that it is very easy to prepare and its ingredients cheap and accessible. Pay attention to the following instructions so that you know how to prepare it.
What we will need:
-Bottle with spray head (1 unit)
–Baking soda (1 tablespoon)
-Fabric softener (3 tablespoons)
-Hot water (3 cups)
How to prepare and use:
The first step is to pour the fabric softener into the spray bottle. Then add the hot water to fill the bottle. Now, proceed to add the baking soda and close the jar. What remains to be done is to shake the bottle until everything is well mixed. With that, our homemade flavoring is ready to stop the bad odors.
However, this is not the only product you can prepare in your home. There are many other things you can prepare with your own hands. Here’s how to prepare your own fabric softener. This way, you can leave your clothes with a unique and unique aroma.
FABRIC SOFTENER What we will need:
-Plastic container with capacity for 3.5 liters
–Essential oil of your choice (20 drops)
–Apple cider vinegar (800 ml)
–Baking soda (10 grams)
-Hot water (150-200ml)
How to prepare and use:
As we said in the previous section, it is important that the plastic container is large. The fragrance we will be making grows, so if the container is small, it will spill. Once we have the container, we will pour hot water over it. Then add the baking soda and apple cider vinegar. This will cause a chemical reaction that will create many bubbles; this is normal.
Once the bubbles at fragrance have disappeared, proceed to empty the liquid into the bottle of fabric softener. Now, the time has come to add the essential oil that we have chosen. To finish with the preparation, we simply stir the mixture and store it in a cool and dry place.
To use it, we must only add it to the soaking clothes or the washing machine. In fact, its way of using is identical to the way to use it with commercial softeners. When using this fabric softener, you will see how the smell takes over the environment and impregnates itself in your curtains and upholstery. This is another trick to make the good smell last longer in your house.
Now that you know these tricks, do not hesitate to put them into practice in your own home. Surely you will be impressed with the results you will get when using it. Which of these two homemade flavorings would you like to try?

"Since Jaws permanently changed the landscape of film distribution in 1975, there have been innumerable attempts to create the ‘it’ movie of the summer. It can be argued that this business model hastened the death of artistry at mainstream theatres, but box-office numbers can’t be wrong, and while Guardians of the Galaxy may not reach such great heights, it is definitely the ‘it’ blockbuster of 2014.
Marvel Studios continues its domination of the entertainment market with their latest adaptation, wherein a disparate group (is there any other kind?) of aliens find themselves unwittingly banded together, at first for mutual reward, and finally for the fate of the known universe. If this sounds familiar, it’s probably because it’s essentially the plot for every space opera since Star Wars. Same music, different band.
The boldest gesture made throughoutGuardians of the Galaxyis personified bythe ever-amiable Chris Pratt early on. When he finishes grooving out to a ‘70s pop song on the path to retrieving the film’s MacGuffin, you may get the sense that his scavenging was meant to resemble the opening scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, andwhilethe sequence is unlikely to raise your pulse above a murmur, it does charge you with adolescent delight. Thus, the name of the game inGuardians of the Galaxy isfrivolity,despite the fact that the notices, and the press materials, would have you believe that Guardians of the Galaxy is an action film. It isn’t.
Rarely have I seen such dispassionate battle sequences, each a carbon copy of the last with the requisite slow motion, choppy editing, and awkward blocking to give the audience the illusion of a fight. And these overtures are made frequently; a prison break, a battle in the cosmos, an atmospheric assault, and a spaceship incursion are all ingredients in a successful sci-fi blockbuster.Do any of these moments in Guardians of the Galaxy produce a memorable moment that isn’t inextricably tied to a punchline?
Do you care either way?
Given Guardians of the Galaxy’s enormous financial, critical, and popular success, the majority clearly does not. So what if the film’s purported conflict plays out like a game derived from a child and his action figures, complete with moral absolutes and witty banter?
Pratt, hardly a veteran but nearing sage-status in his comic virtuosity, is shepherding a cast of unreliable performers to new heights: Zo Saldana, previously known as the sassy Uhura of the new Star Trek, has never been more comfortable. Dave Bautista, who will never attain legitimacy as a thespian, breathes unimaginable warmth and depth to the most hardcore character ever to fall into the autism spectrum. Bradley Cooper, who apparently learned temperance from Richard Burton, does everything he can with a role that was clearly better suited to an R-rating. And Vin Diesel, whose artistic growth is about as inspiring as Sylvester Stallone’s, manages to make the same three words spoken by a living tree sound like poetry.
Pop-ins by John C. Reilly and Pete Serafinowicz ought to make this clear enough, but sidling Glenn Close with a moment where she is essentially hung-up on by a foreign dignitary and utters “Prick…” in response confirms it; Guardians of the Galaxy is the best sci-fi comedy in a decade. Intentional? Probably not. Given the amount of money poured into the admittedly impressive special effects, and the amount of gym time Chris Pratt spent getting ripped, more than a few Hollywood artisans thought this was a successor to Star Wars.
Let’s get one thing straight; criticize George Lucas all you want, the man knew how to direct a damn action sequence. If his two trilogies weren’t littered with some of the best fencing and ship battles in cinematic history, he’d have been tarred and feathered by his ‘fans’ when it was revealed that the sexually-charged fondness shared by Luke and Leia was incestualall along.
In contrast, I would go so far as to say that the story of Guardians of the Galaxy doesn’t matter; when co-writer/director James Gunn tries to tie up some emotional loose ends in the effects-driven climax, you seriously question the point. But if you don’t tear up, or at least feel something, when the Pratt’s protagonist listens to Ain’t No Mountain High Enough, you don’t have a soul.
Good or bad, Guardians of the Galaxy is a film that succeeds in making you feel good. Your standards would be damnable if you found it to be high art, but if you’re incapable of enjoying yourself while watching it, you probably believe that The Seventh Seal has more validity than Robocop, and you’d be wrong. Film is an artistic medium, yes, but considering that it originated when the tired masses huddled into a nickelodeon for a few minutes of titillation, the effect of having a good time for two hours is not diminished by a lack of subtext or creative virtuosity.
Guardians of the Galaxy might not be your type of film, but it’s the type of film the public has been clamoring for since the birth of cinematic exhibition.There is nothing wrong with that.",1
"Ever since Silicon Valley's autonomous cars and mobility apps captured the public imagination, so too has the prospect of an epic battle -- between the forces of high industry and high technology. Nurtured in part by recent history and in part by the part of our brains that loves to watch a good fight, the expectation of an auto-versus-tech throwdown has already become nearly inescapable.
And yet, after the first exchange of rhetorical salvos and billion-dollar investments, there are already signs that all-out conflict between Silicon Valley and Detroit may not be inevitable. Recent developments suggest that accommodation and diversity are more likely to drive ultimate success than zero-sum machismo.
Behind this shift is the dawning realization that that so-called mobility market is not the next internet, just waiting to be turned into a few near-monopolies. Tesla, once the poster child for the limitless ambitions of a high-tech disruptor entering the century-old car business, is proving that auto manufacturing was not a sector of dullards waiting to be blown away by a software startup-style culture. Though Silicon Valley's first and most direct assault on the car business has left an indelible mark, its struggles with quality, service and autonomous drive technology also show that the hard work is not just having the vision but executing it.
Even Tesla's vision suffers from its high-tech hubris. Having proved that electric cars can be powerful, aspirational and road-trip-capable, Tesla's ambitious brand values keep it from exploiting the real opportunity for electric cars: affordable, short-range commuting vehicles. The biggest global market for electric vehicles is China, where most sold are low-cost and short-range. Having vowed that Tesla will never build a slow or short-ranged car, chief executive Elon Musk has shackled his transformative company with the values that catalyzed a transition it now cannot capitalize on.
Uber was in the same boat, but paradoxically its leadership crisis seems to have lifted the burden of its ambitions. Rather than trying to continuously raise its theoretical value by vowing to dominate autonomous drive, flying cars and every other hot new technology, Uber is now focused on leveraging its main advantage by inviting partners to use its massive app-based platform. Uber has reportedly agreed to partner with General Motors'sCruise division -- itself once a would-be auto industry disruptor that was bought by GM -- on driverless technology. Having once cleaned out Carnegie Mellon's famed robotics department to develop its own autonomous drive technology, Uber seems to realize it isn't going to execute the entire robotaxi ""stack"" itself. Not only does it need a partner that can handle manufacturing, but like so many other pure tech companies it also needs help complying with complex safety standards, an underappreciated and growing challenge.
Meanwhile, GM is talking with Uber because its previous rideshare partner, Lyft, has seen Uber's management stumble as a major opportunity. To capitalize on the opening, Lyft shook off an early partnership with GM that might have limited its ambition to become a more universal robotaxi platform. Lyft is now partnering with a wide variety of automakers, raising the possibility of different robotaxi manufacturers competing within the same mobility platform. Again, diversification rather than one singular vision to rule them all.
In the U. S. there's yet another level of myopia found in analyses of the future of mobility: failing to realize there's more to the world than Detroit and Silicon Valley. There are huge investments from major players in Asia that many Americans (even experts in this stuff!) fail to take into account. Foxconn and IDG Capital are the latest, looking to raise $1.5 billion for a tech fund, but they are just trying to keep pace with the vast recent investments in every potential aspect of future mobility by Softbank's $100 billion Vision Fund.
Meanwhile, the Chinese tech company Baidu seems to have seen the need for diversification earlier than most, and is rolling out an ambitious open-source autonomous mobility platform that aspires to be the Android of future transportation. Other giant Chinese tech players including Alibaba and Tencent are spreading bets around various startups, partnering with Chinese and global major automakers, and generally positioning themselves to be much bigger players than a lot of people industry seem to realize.
It's hard not to see these developments as a good thing. The early stages of the mobility tech-hype cycle seemed to focus on finding the potential Google- or Facebook-type player that would dominate the future. Uber and Tesla are classic examples of this first round: companies whose tremendous ambitions drove up their valuations to crazy levels as speculators new to the transportation industry bet on an imagined future where the real world looks like the internet.
Now, it seems, if you're certain that one company or one technology is going to rule the future of mobility, you're probably caught in a hype bubble that is all but guaranteed to burst. If you take a step back and look around the world and across the vast series of technologies required to make autonomous, on-demand mobility a reality, you'll find that the sharpest players have a new approach: diversifying and forming strategic alliances.

You don’t need to go to culinary school to become your own personal chef — I didn’t! Here are some tricks of the trade, though, that will help you build better cooking habits and be smarter about the time and money you do spend at the stove.Let our news meet your inbox.Use your veggie scraps: A little garlic and a quick sauté can save even the saddest bruised salad greens.Use your veggie scraps: A little garlic and a quick sauté can save even the saddest bruised salad greens.Always make a menu, budget and shopping list. Designing your menu around existing items in your pantry and fridge — just as you would a seasonal ingredient at the farmer’s market— will help save you money and cut down on waste. If you’re cooking everything at once, choose dishes that can be made with a variety of techniques — that is, a mix of roasting, stewing and raw, instead of four dishes that require the stovetop. An ideal breakdown is a couple of one- pot meals (stews or soups), a produce centric bowl of grains or legumes, and one or two easy vegetable sides.Use your freezer as an economical extension of your pantry. Can’t make it to the store every week? Stock up on frozen vegetables! Your freezer also allows you to take advantage of fresh seasonal items on sale. If there’s a special on wild sockeye salmon, bring home some fillets and freeze them individually for future use. There are some canned items that I could never swear off (tomatoes, for one), but frozen is generally healthier as you avoid the toxic BPA (bisphenol A) lining that’s in most cans (another known endocrine disruptor). Trader Joe’s and Eden Organics are two great brands that use BPA-free cans.Diversify your animal intake. Unfortunately, a cow is not made up of all filet mignon, and the sea is not 70 percent salmon. Ask your butcher or fishmonger to recommend some other (cheaper) options. Since they’re used to going home with the stuff no one else wants, they’re a wealth of cooking knowledge. Better yet: buy the whole animal. Labor always gets added to the price tag. Bonein chicken thighs will be cheaper than boneless. And bringing home the whole chicken is by far the cheapest way to go.Buy in bulk. Just like the labor in deboning chicken breasts, you end up paying a premium for packaging. Pulling straight from the bulk bins allows you to buy just as much or as little as you need and pay by weight — this is where I source all my whole grains, nuts, seeds, and dried fruit. Store them at home in mason jars or other glass storage containers. Bulk buying also applies to packaged goods. You may not be making puttanesca sauce tonight, but if you see a sale for capers, anchovies, or canned tomatoes, it pays in the long term to stock up when these shelf-stable items are at their cheapest. Use your spice rack. This is one of the best places you can put your money in terms of creating flavorful meals out of humble ingredients. Suddenly, one cup of lentils can become five different dishes. Spices also have amazing medicinal powers. You can slowly build your collection up over time, but many will lose their punch and efficacy after a year or two. Make “peasant” food. The Romans in particular were incredibly frugal: think stale bread in meatballs, Parmesan rinds in soup. A lot of Asian cuisines use meat as more of a garnish (ahem, pad Thai) instead of as a centerpiece, which is both healthier and cheaper. If you’re making many dishes at once, it helps to stick to one ethnic cuisine for your menu so you can mix and match throughout the week. Once you have all the condiments, making takeout at home becomes that much easier.Ignore expiration dates. Americans throw away 165 billion dollars’ worth of food every year. One reason: hysteria around grocery items that have exceeded their expiration dates. Don’t rely solely on these numbers, which are arbitrarily set by the brands themselves, which benefit from you buying more food. Instead, look for signs that something has gone off. If it smells fine and has no visible mold, you’re usually good to go. And if that mold is on cheese, cut around it and nibble away.Use your veggie scraps. Recycled veggie stock is a great way to reuse onion skins, herb stems, and the like. Some other ideas for often-tossed parts: asparagus stalk pesto, pickled chard stems, and candied lemon peel. A little garlic and a quick sauté can save even the saddest bruised salad greens.Brown bag it. If you’re the type of person who goes out often and feels home cooking gets in the way of your social life, commit to bringing lunch to work. As Mark Bittman acknowledged in his protocol VB6, your daytime meals are when you have the most control and willpower to make good choices. Start by batch cooking just two dishes for the week. Pack them individually and put a note on your door so you remember to take them in the morning.Get a farm share. If you’re committed to weekly batch cooking, a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) is one of the most affordable ways to get large quantities of local produce without having the hassle of going to the farmer’s market. Many will deliver directly to your door. The less often you go to grocery stores with a million impulse options, the less you’re likely to stray from your healthy food choices and budget.Adapted from THE WELLNESS PROJECT by arrangement with Pam Krauss Books/Avery, a member of Penguin Group (USA) LLC, A Penguin Random House Company.

"With artificial intelligence getting more advanced, it’s not surprising to learn that NASA has developed a robot that is eerily human-like. The new R2 humanoid robot is in test mode, showing humans how it can handle living on Mars.
Robonaut2 (R2) has been based on the International Space Station (ISS) since 2011, where the prototype is assisting astronauts as well as carrying out operations and repairs deemed too risky for humans.
Now NASA is working with a crowd-sourcing website to design tools that R2 can use to furtherhelpthe crew.
Through NASA’s Tournament Lab, the agency has partnered with Freelancer.com to tap into the site’s 16 million users, who they want to help create CAD (computeraided design) models of tools to be used by R2 on the ISS.
These could also eventually be used on Mars, where it is hoped R2 and subsequent models could be sent.
Freelancer.com is running crowdsourcing contests for users to solve complex problems astronauts face duringspace exploration, as well as help to buildtoolswith which R2 can carry out daily chores.
So far challenges to create five objects R2 can use, including a grapple hook and large trigger flashlight have been completed, but nine more are still available for budding designers.
These include a cordless drill, its charger, a sheathed hose, and stands for blankets and dumbbells.
Freelancer.com’sCEOMatt Barrie said: “We are honoured to welcome NASA to the 16 million strong user Freelancer.com community.
“Nasa Tournament Lab working with Freelancer.com clearly shows that crowdsourcing solutions has become an essential part of creativity and innovation and that there is a strong demand to develop ingenious and world-leading solutions online.
“We look forward tocollaboratingwithNASAon the cutting edge of space exploration, and seeing the CAD designs our freelancers produce for Robonaut 2.”
NASA is looking at continuing to use crowdsourcing sites like Freelancer.com to help it develop tools and technologies for other space exploration tasks.",1
"The selfie stick was possibly the most hated gadget of 2015 —and with good reason. That slimming photo angle often comes with a price of irritating the people around you whom you've forgotten existed in your Instagram-focused world. Despite growing annoyance, the selfie is likely here to stay, but there are alternatives to the giant ""narcissus-stick.""
1. Bring a travel tripod. Something lightweight (carbon-fiber is lighter than aluminum alloy) that can fold down to be compact and can handle the weight of your camera is good. Also look into stability — which is essentially why you're buying a tripod in the first place. I personally love my JOBY Gorillapod SLR-Zoom, with bendable legs and the ability to keep even my heavy DSLR sturdy. I pair this with the following item for the perfect hands-free selfie.
2. Use an intervalometer. Despite the sci-fi name, this is just a remote you can set to take a certain amount of photos with a certain amount of seconds between each shot. Choose the intervals, plug the gadget into your camera and it does the rest, even focusing the lens for you. It's better than the built-in camera timer as you never need to press the camera shutter or reset the settings for each shoot.
3. Selfie-focused apps. Don't think your mug is pretty enough for a selfie? There's an app for that. Check out FaceTune, a portrait-editing app that smooths skin, whitens teeth, removes imperfections, highlights your best features and changes lighting, among other options. Another great download is Retrica, showcasing over 100 photo filters and allowing you to adjust your selfie's exposure. Tip: If you're not 100% happy with your selfie, a black and white filter will hide imperfections.
4. A wide-angle lens. While not mandatory, wide-angle lenses capture more of the background scenery to transform the typically egotistical selfie into an actual story of where you are. Because you're in the foreground you'll still be the focus, but the photo is less dominated by your face. I’ve found my GoProis great for this (it's much lighter than a DSLR), though clip-on smartphone lenses like the SelfieMaster Easy Selfie Lens, Aerband olloclipare also worth checking out.
5. LuMee Case($49.95+). We first mentioned the LuMee Case in our holiday stocking stuffer recommendations, and still stand by it. This iPhone and Samsung case features an outline of LED lights to better illuminate your selfies (or, if you're of the less vain variety, you can use it as a camping flashlight or for help shuffling through your gear in the dark).
6. Cannon's PowerShot G7X. Not only does this lightweight camera perform well in low light, offer image stabilization and feature a quick 4.2x f/1.8-2.8 optical zoom lens, but the screen flips to face you so you can see exactly what you're taking a photo of. It's sort of like using the front face of your smartphone camera, but with a much higher-quality image.
Does using any of the above make selfies any less annoying? Maybe not. But at least you won't impale anyone with a giant stick.",0
"No More Cell Phones on Federal Highways – New Law Effective 7/1/15.
Beginning July 1st, drivers can no longer use cell phones/handheld devices on federal highways, U. S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced last week.
“The studies are all there. The stories are all there. Cell phones are a risk,” said Foxx. “This bill is another step to help make our roads safer.”
Along with federal and interstate highways, the bill outlaws cell use in federal parks, parking areas for federal buildings, and garages.
Drivers caught talking, texting, browsing, or using apps (including hands-on maps) will be subject to stiff fines up to possible jail time.
The new legislation does allow for the use of hands-free devices including Bluetooth.
“With the acceleration of voice-command phones and device, drivers can put their hands back on the wheels,” Foxx continued. “Drivers have far too many distractions all ready.”
Federal officers are working with state highway patrols to monitor and deliver citations. Foxx detailed various training techniques in use to help officers in observation of distracted drivers.
While many applaud the ban on cell phones, opponents of the bills vowed to keep fighting. “How will a cop know if I am on a phone or just looking at my knee?” shouts 32-year old Luke Austin.
“Pull over,” states Foxx. “If you have to text – If you have to map directions – If you have to tweet, just pull over into a parking lot or a rest area and take care of business.”
The fine is a minimum of $200 for the 1st offense, $500 for the 2nd offense and 6 months in jail for the 3rd offense.",1

"Choosing the best microphone for karaoke is becoming the most concerning of people because when sing at home, people feel better after working and save money as well. Therefore, the post will introduce tips and guidelines for checking your choice of microphones or quality. There are two types of karaoke microphones available in the market today including microphones and wired microphones.
The microphone body has purpose to hold it while singing, on which there is a switch with a switch and a switch with no switch off. On the head there is a rounded shot of iron or plastic to protect the microphone, which sounds the singer. Still inside of the diaphragm above the microphone.
Its microtubule contains vibration membrane and magnetic coils. The vibration membrane vibrates when the sound of the voice and the magnet winding turns into a very small sound wave to transmit to the karaoke amplifier to amplify it and propagate it to your ear.
The wired microphone is the voice of the voice after being converted to a very small sound wave and then transmitted to the amp through the line. We usually call it a microphone wire. Wireless microphones have a body, protective cover, microphone, and coil membrane identical to a wired microphone. However, instead of transmitting by wire, it transmits by high frequency waves and there is a transmitter on the microphone‘s body (the voice it receives from the singer) into space at a certain radius (100-200m). Therefore, at the karaoke amplifier there will be a receiver for the audio signal that the microphones emit
We should use wireless microphones in the case which in the midst of the singer and amply to the distance of 20 meters or more because if you use a wired microphone, the signal goes too far down the line. Therefore, almost people buy the microphone for karaoke’s room. If you want to buy a micro for singing through YouTube, a normal microphone is the best microphone for YouTube for you because it has cheaper price and better quality.
A good microphone will have wide and honest sound. Narrow sound is when you adjust the middle button of the microphone up high, the bass is broken and the high is similar. The fine tuning of the bass is very high and the high tune is comfortable without being crushed or humming.
When adjusting the microphone for singing, it is important to first adjust the microphone so that the vocalist can help with the loss of voice when singing, then adjust the maximum mid-bass when the broken sound, then back up a bit.
These tips are necessary and useful things for anyone wanting to buy the best karaoke microphone for their own. However, in order to buy the best suitable microphone, you should depend on your purpose when buying one to choose the best one. Furthermore, if you want to buy the best microphone to make sure that you will sing amazing song, you should try to buy high quality microphone although it will have higher price than usual.",1
"Sorry, Carey Bolster and Frances Nankin is no longer taking questions.
For some children, the textbook may indeed feel too structured when compared with the dynamics and fun that they can experience when doing 'hands-on' math. Educational games and PBS programs are great ways to extend your boys' math experiences. Cyberchase, for example, is specifically designed to support math education and reflects the curriculum standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The project (TV show, online games and print activities) encourages kids to see, think, and do math and appeals to their different learning styles.
Try visiting the web site (pbskids.org/Cyberchase) to find out more about it. The episodes are listed by math topics under ""For Parents & Teachers/ Episode Descriptions."" We recommend viewing a show uninterrupted with your children, and then talking about it afterwards. The following questions can help make your conversation more thoughtful:
* What was the problem the kids had to solve in this show?
* How did the kids figure out how to solve it?
* Did you have a different way to solve it? How does your solution work?
You might have your sons draw pictures or write stories to answer these questions, and follow up by visiting the web site to play a math game related to the show. You might also use related print materials found online to extend their learning.
As well, here are some ways to make math a part of your kids' everyday experiences.
* When measuring for cooking or baking, have your kids make the
measures for you. Once they get used to the whole and fractional
measures, limit what they can use so that they have to reason how to
get the measure they want. (For example, measure a cup of flour using
only the Β or 1/3 cup measures.)
* Use colored candies to teach fractions. Ask how many are a certain
color and what fraction of the whole batch that color represents.
* Estimation is a powerful tool in mathematics. The next time you are
traveling, have your kids estimate when you have traveled a mile, then
verify it with the car's odometer. At the restaurant, challenge them to
estimate the total bill.
* Talk about the shapes of 'stop' signs, 'yield' signs, 'mileage'
markers, designs on buildings or sidewalks, or even the lug nut on car
wheels or fire hydrants.
* Take apart cereal boxes to see how the 3-D shape is made from 2-D shapes.
Experiences like these will help your kids see that not only is math all around them, but that it is dynamic and fun. This will make that textbook more meaningful!
Your daughters are not alone! Many children feel they cannot do math and are easily frustrated by the problems they are faced with at school. For these kids, it helps to show them that math is a tool they can use to make sense of the world around them. This becomes meaningful when we use math for a purpose, when we tie it to a real need, and help kids find their own ways to use it. (Please see our answer to the previous question for ways to do this.)
In reality, kids do a lot of math and don't know it! For example, when they turn to a page in a book, they have to know if the number of the page they are on is less than or greater than the page they are turning to. And when they watch a show on TV, they often have to estimate how much time is left in a show before they have to do something else. When walking or riding to school, they estimate every day about how far it is and how long it will take to get there. Pointing out their skills in these areas helps to build their confidence.
Having to do pencil and paper work can be scary because there is risk of a 'wrong' answer. Kids don't like to be wrong, nor do we. But in math, being wrong often leads to being right! You can help your children learn from their mistakes by having them talk out loud as they are doing their problems. Talking through each step when working a problem, whether doing it right or wrong, is a great way to overcome fear and frustration. As well, it helps if you demonstrate your own thinking when you have a problem you are trying to work out. Share your mistakes.
If you focus on the strategies your daughters use to solve problems, you can help them discover that there may be more than one way to solve them, thereby building their confidence when faced with new problems and increasing their self-esteem.
It is not unusual for a child to have difficulty concentrating on math problems for a long period of time. Not only do attention spans vary from child to child, but they also vary with the type of problems the child is working on! Consider letting your daughter work on an assignment for a specified short period of time, then have her stop and come back to it later. She might do this several times before the assignment is completed.
It is also not unusual for a child to get frustrated with parental help, especially if it is not asked for. One way to handle this is to tell your child that you will only offer to help if she asks you to. Then stick to that promise! The child then has the option to approach the math assignment in her own fashion, and feels secure in the knowledge that she can ask for help when she needs it.
Many children benefit from attacking a math problem if they pretend to be the teacher. You might try having your child teach a problem she is comfortable with to a stuffed toy. Teaching in this fashion can help build confidence. It also helps kids articulate what they are thinking as they solve a problem. You may have to interject at some point to check your child's understanding. Try, "" What if your toy didn't understand? Can you show it a different way?"" Or ""Your toy did it this way. Do you agree with this?"" Then, when faced with a more difficult problem, the child has a comfort zone she can fall back on to lessen those feelings of stress.
The most important thing you can do is to help her feel less pressured. Look for opportunities where you can smile, laugh, and poke fun at yourself as you work to solve a problem. Demonstrating lighthearted -- but positive and persistent -- behavior often relieves some of the pressure a child is feeling and makes it easier for her to accept the difficulties she may be having.
A young viewer recently said about a show she'd seen, ""I liked how they figured out how to figure it out!"" Children - like your son - are natural problem solvers and we know from both observation and research that their Cyberchase viewing is not passive. Their minds are working hard, solving problems right alongside the characters in the show. We also know from research that children gain significant benefits from watching other children solve problems - benefits that include increased confidence in their own ability to solve problems and the higher self-esteem that accompanies that feeling.
While your son may not be good at understanding problems similar to those on the show, we suspect that repeat viewing of the same episode would give him the exposure and time he needs to generalize about other problems. Think about how we learn as adults: Few of us are able to readily transfer what we learn from a specific problem to other problems of that type. We need time and friendly discussion that enhances our understanding.
By the way, we consciously created the 'For Real' live-action portion of the Cyberchase show to expose kids to another approach to the same type of math problem. Our goal is to give kids another way to think about the math that helps them recognize it in the real world.
Try playing a game in which you ask your child, ""I wonder how ...?"" Do this at home, when traveling, while playing a sport or shopping. Ask about things they do and see. For example, ""I wonder how I could find the number of windows on that big building."" After solving the problem, follow up with a new question: ""I wonder how many different ways we could find this answer."" (Also see our suggestions above for thought-provoking questions you can use to talk about the show after viewing.)
Over time, as kids become more adept with how to begin
solving a problem, they build a set of strategies, and they are able to apply what they have learned to new situations. In this way they gain experience in solving problems and build their own reliable skill set.
Good question! While we are definitely not experts in this area, we can confidently suggest that, when the first language is Spanish, you contact TODOS: Mathematics for All (www.todos-math.org). The mission of this organization is to ""advocate for an equitable and high quality mathematics education for all students ... by advancing the professional growth and equity awareness of educators."" The Resources section of their web site may give you additional ideas. As well, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (www.nctm.org) may be helpful.
Several of the Cyberchase print materials are available in Spanish. Cyberchase en Casa, for example, gives you activity cards developed for parents. You can download these from the Cyberchase website (pbskids.org/cyberchase).
For children, using physical examples, as you suggest, is a great idea. Give her concrete experiences that are directly related to the questions she asks. But, because of her age and developmental abilities, we caution you against trying to ""teach"" her about fractions. Fractions can be difficult for children to understand because in our everyday experiences, we use them in two different ways. Fractions represent equal parts of a whole, right? But that whole may be your single apple or slice of toast, or it may be a group of objects, such as a bag of multi-colored colored candies. Children twice your daughter's age have trouble with this, so we suggest you go slowly.
Children become confused when writing fractions using not one, but two numbers. The bottom number tells how many equal parts the whole has been divided into, and the top number tells how many of those parts you have. Your 4-year-old daughter has scarcely had time to absorb how we use whole numbers to represent objects, let alone using two numbers to represent fractions!
Visit our website (pbskids.org/cyberchase) for more ideas. Under ""For Parents and Teachers"" you can use the search function to get a list of all the Cyberchase episodes and materials available that are related to fractions.
Memorizing the times tables is often a frustrating experience for children because the memorization does not come easily and mastery takes time. Yet educators agree that doing so is worth the effort because it makes understanding division easier. Using flash cards (for visual reinforcement) and recorded songs (for audio reinforcement) are both excellent ways to help your daughter with her memorization. Here are some other suggestions.
Use animal legs. For example, a spider has 8 legs. Ask: How many legs does 1 spider have? (8) How about 2 spiders? (16) How about 3? And so on. Your child can draw pictures to show the number of legs, and repeat the multiplication facts out loud. Play the same game with cats or dogs (4 legs), and insects (6 legs), and birds (2 legs).
Help your child look for patterns in the multiplication facts. Multiply by 2, for example, and the product always ends in 0,2,4,6, or 8. When you multiply by 5 and look at the product, the number in the ones place is always 5 or 0. Multiply by 3 and there are several patterns you can see. Here's one: The sum of the digits in the product is always 3, 6, or 9. For example, the product of 3 times 9 is 27, add these digits (2+7) and you get 9!
Make a Hundreds Chart. On a grid or graph paper, write the numbers 1-10 in the first row of squares, 11-20 in the second row, and so on until you complete the 91-100 row. Then use the chart to locate and color the multiples of different numbers. Try multiples of 3, for example. The products are always 3 digits apart. Have your child color in the squares that show these products. The pattern will show ""skip two numbers, color the next."" Color multiples of other numbers and talk about the patterns.
Make flashcards in the shape of a triangle to show 'number families' - three numbers that include the two multipliers plus the product. On one card, for example, you might write a 3 on one corner of the triangle, a 12 on another corner and a 36 on the last corner. In this way, your daughter can see the complete ""number family"" and learn to keep them together in her mind. By covering any one number with your finger, she can look at the other two numbers to tell you the one you've covered. This method unifies the multiplication and division math facts from the very beginning.
This is a great question. We often use math to solve problems around the home and miss opportunities for sharing with our kids. For example, if you were going to build a deck or dog house you would use measurement, draw pictures (representation), determine how much material you need to order (estimation), and, of course, figure the cost (number operations). If you are building something, involve your child in the process, being careful to point out the different kinds of math involved so that the child realizes the connections.
Gardening is another example where you could share the math you do and talk about the different concepts you are applying. When planting flowers or vegetables, you need to determine the area of the garden (measurement) and perhaps measure the perimeter if a fence is required. Then you need to check to see how much room each mature plant will need (estimation), determine the number of rows you have room for (number operations), the distance between rows and plants (number operations), laying off parallel rows (geometry), and finally, planting the seedlings (measurement again).
You might look at a project you're undertaking and list the steps you would go through to solve the problem. Then label the math involved and share with your child
Here is another fun activity that uses alphabet cereal or pasta. Sort the contents into piles by letter (sorting). Now write the letters of the alphabet horizontally on a large piece of paper and place the letters one above the other so they make a column above or below the letter you wrote (organizing information). This forms a bar graph (graphing). Help you child analyze the graph by asking questions like: Are there the same number of each letter? Which letter(s) appeared most or least ? Are there any letters that are not in the box? (Analyzing data).
When you buy a new box, have your child use the information to predict the number of each letter in the box, and then test the prediction by using the same steps as before. Note you could use a similar procedure for M&M's or Skittles if you sort them by color.
Finally, watch for things your child does that use math. Ask questions about the steps she is using and then analyze these in terms of the math involved. Be excited and make comments like, ""Wow, you just used measurement!""
I feel insecure about my own understanding of mathematics. I want to
help my child with his homework, but I am somewhat uncomfortable. Do
you have any ideas that might help me?
It is good to hear that you are concerned about your child learning mathematics and know that math has to extend beyond the classroom if your child is going to understand it. You are not alone when you feel insecure helping your child with his homework. Many parents relate the difficulties they had learning math and how they avoided the subject when they were in school, even though they knew math was important. ""I was never good in math"" is a common quote. But it shouldn't be!
Interestingly, you probably do not have the same feeling about helping your child with reading. You are concerned about your son's reading skills, and take a positive approach. You may enjoy reading to him, and do this often, helping him to build his own positive attitude toward reading. You know that the more you read with him, the more successful he will become.
It makes sense to apply this same approach to mathematics. Here are some dos and don'ts to consider:
Don't pass on a negative attitude toward math.
Saying ""I was never good at math"" only makes your child feel afraid.
(If my parent was never good at it, I probably won't be good at it
either!) You want to convey an attitude of curiosity. You can say ""I'm
not sure I remember this -- let's work on it together. If we get stuck,
we'll ask for help."" You can also say, ""Wow! I didn't learn this until
high school. Good for you!""Do let your child see you do math. Let him see you
balance your check book, figure out what store has the best buy for an
item you want, estimate how much chicken to buy, find where a picture
should be placed on a wall, keep score at miniature golf, or buy gas
for the car. Let him see that you do math everyday and that it helps
you manage the things you have to get done. Do your mathematics thinking out loud. Let your
child hear how you are figuring out when to put the roast in the oven
so it will be ready for dinner. When measuring, say aloud, ""Now how
many teaspoons are in a tablespoon?"" Then answer yourself, or if you
don't know, look it up in the cookbook. It is OK to use a reference.
Count your change out loud.Don't make math seem boring and dreary. Instill in
your child the same level of comfort and excitement you share when you
read to him. Play math games, get puzzle books and work them out
together. A friend used to put a puzzle on the refrigerator and would
keep it there until someone solved it. Granted, sometimes he had to act
stumped and give hints to be sure his child came up with some of the
answers.
Additionally, do watch Cyberchase with your child so you can talk about what is happening. Check out the For Real segment, which often contains activities you can do with your child. Also look at our website (pbskids.org/cyberchase). (See above for more.)
Finally, remember you are using math everyday and using it well. You are better at math than you think you are, and you can use this realization to build a ""can-do"" attitude in your child.

As someone who loves nature, I try my best to live in an Earth-friendly way. I don’t litter, I take public transit, and I recycle as often as I can. But I’m always looking for ways to do better and live with less impact.
But honestly, it can be tough. Living organically can be really expensive, and life often moves way too quickly for me to always make the most responsible decisions.
That’s why I love learning eco-friendly tricks like this. Who knew that by simply hanging on to some old newspapers,you could not only enhance your garden, but improve the Earth?
So often, the things that are the worst for nature are expensive for us. Seems kind of backwards, right? Well, thanks to this incredible tutorial from the award-winning gardener Kevin Jacobs, you’ll not only be saving nature, but quite a few bucks as well!
Will you be trying this out in your backyard? Let us know in the comments if you do!
Be sure to watch the video below, too, and please SHARE if you think we should all try harder to protect nature!

If you have a plot of land that’s perfect for gardening, but it’s been invaded by weeds, don’t be so quick to turn to chemical sprays.
With just some old newspaper, you can completely transform the way you garden forever. Both nature and your wallet are sure to appreciate this!
First, start off by watering your garden very well. Then, begin to lay down the pages of your paper directly atop the weeds and around your existing plants.
Once you’ve completely covered your chosen ground, you’re ready to start watering.    Grab your hose and give it a good douse. Don’t worry about water being unable to penetrate the paper; it’ll go right through to the soil below.    Once your papers are soaked through, cover them with a 3-inch layer of mulch. You can use shredded leaves or wood chips.
The newspaper not only starves out weeds, but it feeds the soil below as well.    Soon, your paper will begin to decompose — which will make for some very happy little worms! These little guys are essential for building healthy soil, which means better veggies.
If you don’t have a lot of newspaper, you can use cardboard instead. It will work just as well.    Isn’t this a great alternative to toxic chemicals? The Earth is sure to thank you for this!

Oh, butter. There’s something so wonderfully magical about this item. Its spreadable quality makes it the ultimate partner for a toasty piece of bread or slathered atop a warm muffin. It also aids in perfect pastry perfections and meals galore! Because of its wide variety of uses, you’ll be hard pressed to find someone who can go without the use of butter.
As a child, you likely got scolded once or twice for unintentionally leaving the milk on the counter for a few hours, causing it to spoil and ruining the entire gallon. Obviously, this scenario isn’t something that occurs intentionally but, on average, most dairy products require refrigeration if not in use. Things such as cheese, yogurt, and cream follows the same pattern.
When it comes to butter, there has seemed to be a little discrepancy. In my house growing up, butter always was refrigerated unless it need to sit out for some time to warm to room temperature. In my mother-in-law’s house, that’s completely opposite. She leaves her butter sitting in a dish on the counter.
It’s an age-old debate as to whether or not it is actually safe to consume butter that has been unrefrigerated for a period of time. Butter is, after all, comprised of milk so does that make it fall into the category of constant refrigeration? Because this question has circulated for quite some time, food researchers decided to do a little investigating.
Before long, they discovered just the allotted amount of time that butter can stay unrefrigerated before it spoils. Needless to say, we were a little shocked. While it is a preference, you can leave butter in a butter crock or a similar, air-tight container for up to two weeks. Naturally, there are some rules to that limit.
The butter must be salted because this type of butter has a higher sodium content that aids in keeping bacteria at bay. If your kitchen temperature stays near 70 degrees, you must always refrigerate your butter no matter if it is salted or not simply because the butter won’t be able to stay somewhat solidified at a temperature that high.
While the FDA hasn’t quite jumped on board with this logic, you can leave your butter out at your own risk. It all goes back to personal preference. Now that you know the limit, has that changed your mind about leaving it out or keeping it stored in the fridge?

"Natural News) The “unimaginable” levels of radiation at the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant have been widely reported on; in early February 2017, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) reported that the radiation levels inside reactor 2 had reached a devastating 530 sieverts per hour. Just a mere five sieverts is enough to be lethal in a matter of months, and ten sieverts can lead to death in just a few short weeks.
These recent reports have made it seem like theradiation at Fukushimais a new phenomenon, but that simply isn’t the case. While the previous record radiation high at the site was just 73 sieverts (much lower, but still dangerous to humans), Tepco has pointed out that their new high of 530 sieverts was recorded actually inside of reactor 2. For comparison, Chernobyl only reached a high of 300 sieverts per hour.
The presence of extremely high radiation levels in and around thedamaged nuclear reactors at Fukushimais not new: this is just the first time they’ve actually recorded it. Three reactors melted down on that fateful day in 2011, and those meltdowns have never ceased. Radiation at the Fukushima disaster site has been, and will continue to be, out of control for quite some time.
In an email dated February 10, Fairewinds Energy Education reportedly stated, “Although this robotic measurement just occurred, this high radiation reading was anticipated and has existed inside the damaged Unit 2 atomic reactor since the disaster began nearly 6 years ago…. As Fairewinds has said for 6 years, there are no easy solutions because groundwater is in direct contact with the nuclear corium (melted fuel) at Fukushima Daiichi.”
Theradiation levelsat the Fukushima disaster site have been compared to a “nuclear explosion that doesn’t end.” And Tepco, who manages the facility, continues to desperately try and convince the rest of the world that they have the situation under control. As the Fairewinds Energy Education email revealed, that is anything but the case.
Tepco has at least admitted that there is a hole in the metal grating beneath reactor 2’s pressure vessel that is nearly three-feet wide. It’s likely that melting fuel has burned its way through the pressure vessel and the grating, though Tepco says at this point in time, it’s merely a hypothesis.
However, a new high level of radiation has also been detected: 650 sieverts. If 530 sieverts was “unimaginable,” 650 must be beyond our ability to fathom. A cleaning robot lasted a mere two hours at the reactor. Tepco officials say they need to locate the melting fuel’s exact location, condition and need to be aware of other structural damages before they can begin clean-up efforts, which theysayare expected to take forty-some-odd years.
The truth is thatit will take yearsto even develop the technology for robots to get close enough to the wreckage for any useful length of time. As it stands, the best robots are only designed to withstand 1,000 sieverts, and the closer they get to the fuel, the shorter theirsurvival timewill be.
What is perhaps more worrisome though is the fact thatallof this news relatesonlyto reactor 2. The other damaged reactors, 1 and 3, have not been featured in the news, and there is not much reliable information on the melted reactor cores of these units.
Global Research reports, “Last November, in a half-hour talk reviewing the Fukushima crisis, Arnie Gunderson of Fairewinds Energy Education discussed the three missing reactor cores and what he suspected was the likelihood that they had not been contained within the reactor.”
Given that it’s been six years and Tepco doesn’t know where the melted fuel is located in the reactors, there is almost no information on reactors 1 and 3, and reactor 2 has a meter-wide hole in it, it is not beyond reason to posit that perhaps they can’t find the fuelrods in the reactorsbecause the fuel isn’t contained there anymore.
Either way, the events at reactor 2 are certainly concerning enough on their own.As Mike Adams suggests, it is possible that as the fuel rods become more exposed, or come into closer contact with each other, the mass-to-energy conversion is becoming more accelerated and amplified. The fuel has already burned a hole through a pressure vessel, and it’s on its way to contaminating the groundwater, if it hasn’t already. And as Adams states, some of this fuel containsextremely toxic Plutonium-239, which has a half-life of 24,000 years — once it enters the groundwater, it is going to be there for averylong time.
Andwe’re supposed to believethey have everything under control?",1
"The produce you buy in the supermarket or grocery store is not fresh. With many items, like spinach, the leaves may have been plucked no more than a few weeks ago. But with many others, like apples, the fruit probably sat in cold storage for a year before making its way to the supermarket.
But in a recent Facebook discussion in which many readers chimed in with incredulous statements like, “A year old? No way!” I realized I was wrong. This information is not common knowledge.
But it should be.
Here in the U. S. apples generally ripen between August and September. They pick the apples when they’re slightly unripe, treat them with a chemical called 1-methylcyclopropene, wax them, box them, stack them on pallets, and keep them in cold storage warehouses for an average of 9-12 months.
I guess we should be grateful. It used to be that rather than being sprayed with 1-methylcyclopropene (also known as 1-MCP), cold storage apples were sprayed with fungicide.
From the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service, we learn this:
Apples not intended for fresh market are stored at low temperatures, with low levels of oxygen and high levels of carbon dioxide. While this slows the apples’ natural production of ethylene and its effects, fungicides must often be applied to prevent fungal rots from taking hold. But since its commercial debut in 2002 under the name “SmartFresh,” 1-MCP has in some cases diminished the need for such treatment.
(source)
In fact, the development and use of 1-MCP has made it common for apples to sit even longer in cold storage. That’s because, according the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service,
On average, treated apples stayed firm for 3 to 6 months longer than untreated controls when placed in controlled-atmosphere storage conditions. Red Delicious apples, for example, stayed crunchier 2 to 3 weeks longer than untreated controls after removal from storage.
(source)
After learning that apples that have sat in cold storage for 12 months are commonly called “birthday apples” within the industry, one Australian investigative news organization decided to do a test to see just how old the apples on their grocery store shelves really were. They collected samples from major Australian supermarkets and sent them to the Sydney Postharvest Laboratory for testing.
Analysis showed the Woolworths samples were about 10 months old while the Norton Street and Coles products had spent 9 months in storage since being harvested.
(source)
According to Martin Lindstrom, author of Brandwashed: Tricks Companies Use to Manipulate Our Minds and Persuade Us to Buy, the average supermarket apple is 14 months old.
This is unsurprising to me, but may be shocking to you.
That’s because my husband used to manage a cold-storage warehouse for Harry & Davidwhen we lived in Oregon. He saw first hand how their “fresh fruit” was handled — from harvest in the nearby valleys to specialized climate control storage.
What he saw inspired me to never want to eat a grocery store fruit again, long before I ever became the “Real Foodie” that I am today. I wish I could go into details, but honestly? I don’t want to be sued!
If you want to eat apples all year long, regardless of the season, maybe you’re glad to hear that modern engineering and science have mastered the art of keeping apples “fresh” for a year or more.
Yet at what cost?
The obvious differences in flavor and texture between fresh apples and stored apples aside, what’s so bad about eating produce that’s this old?
Aside from dietary fiber and sugar, apples are a rich source of polyphenols — antioxidants that can help fight cancer and improve post-workout recovery by reducing muscle fatigue.
Yet according to this study, antioxidant activity in apples gradually drops off after three months of storage in the cold. An apple stored for nearly a year? It will have almost no antioxidants remaining in it whatsoever.
This is also true of most vegetables and fruits: the less fresh they are, the less nutrients they have.
Buy fresh. Don’t assume you’ll get apples year round. Buy in season. Buy from a local farmer when possible. Once you buy your apples, store them on your counter top rather than the fridge.
Quickly eat or remove bruised apples as the old saying is most certainly true, “one bad apple spoils the bunch.”
Don’t assume that buying organic apples will automatically mean you’re buying fresh apples either.

"Yesterday we got our power back. The day before we were told we could use the water to bathe and drink. I am no longer camping out in my own home. I have made it back to shore and there is ground under my feet again, but I am facing a pretty big hill to climb.
There had been a mandatory evacuation order for my barrier beach island, just like there had been for Irene, which hadn't even put out our lights. The mister said we'll just stay put.. it'll be alright.  The wind rose, the trees began waving around, and the power went out at 7:27 pm.
High tide for us was set for 8:11 pm.  There was water in the street, gutter to gutter, but not over the curb. I thought ""Well, that's alright then."" I kept glancing out the window. Apparently the ""surge"" and high tide hadn't consulted. Suddenly it seemed a huge river had grown between us and the house across the street.
It was like a black Niagara ... up to the dash of the Taurus and nearly up to the windows of the Quest. It was moving so fast that had I dipped my foot over the edge of our top porch step I would have been pulled in.  I could make out the speed of the water by the light of exploding transformers. At the height  of this fury the electrical system of our van shorted and the interior lights went on, as if some Fuath had climbed in determined to drive away.
About 8:40 water started coming up through the floorboards It didn't come up very high, and it didn't stay very long, but I threw a drawerful of important papers into a plastic bag and clothes, blankets, flashlights and candles into another and pulled down the attic stairs, just in case. It sank back down into the crawl space in the next couple hours, leaving the floors ruined, furniture wrecked, appliances useless, and the four of us wiped out. I put in a quick call to Mom & my Sis.. (I'm not sure how I managed that . . apparently the cell phone hadn't quite died yet.. It did by morning) and passed out.
It took days before we could communicate with the outside world again by any means. The land line and the old princess phone that I've kept for decades ""in case the power goes out"" is STILL dead.
We have a lot of fixing to do, all the cars to replace and probably insurance claims to fight for. We are all ok though.
Thank you, all you who ""held us in the light""",1

Scientists make surprise discovery of massive new forests around the world
A new study from an international team of scientists has found that the globe is become greener, and CO2 emissions are the main culprit as the fertilizer. (Getty Images)
Recent global analysis of the Earth’s drylands has discovered 467 million hectares of unreported forested areas — or roughly seven times the size of Texas — located in drylands across the world. The discovery has lent more credenceto the theory that increasing levels ofman-made CO2 emissions are actually helping to increase global greening.
Thestudy, conducted by biologistsAndrew Lowe and Ben Sparrow as well as 28 other co-authors, used modern high-resolution satellite imagery via Google Earth Engine to map 210,000 drylands.This high-resolution imagery allowed biologiststo discoverthat forests cover a whopping 9 percent more of the worldthan previously thought.
“We found new dryland forest on all inhabited continents, but mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, around the Mediterranean, central India, coastal Australia, western South America, northeastern Brazil, northern Colombia and Venezuela, and northern parts of the boreal forests in Canada and Russia. In Africa, our study has doubled the amount of known dryland forest,”Lowe and Sparrow wrote in their reportat The Conversation.
“With current satellite imagery and mapping techniques, it might seem amazing that these forests have stayed hidden in plain sight for so long. But this type of forest was previously difficult to measure globally, because of the relatively low density of trees,” the report said.
This greening is likely the result ofthe fertilizing effects of CO2, as revealed in a2016 studyby an international team of 32 scientists from 24 institutions. The study, titled“Greening of the Earth and its Drivers,” utilized satellite sensors over the span of 33 years to monitor the Earth’s vegetation. What they found wasthat the Earth had greened significantly due to increased CO2 emissions. The greening was equivalent to “adding a green continent about two-times the size of mainland USA,” according to a statement by Dr. Zaichun Zhu, a researcher from China’s Peking University.
Furthermore, the 2016 studyalsorevealed thatonly 4 percent of the Earthshowed global “browning”:
We show a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25% to 50% of the global vegetated area, whereas less than 4% of the globe shows decreasing LAI (browning). Factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO fertilization effects explain 70% of the observed greening trend.
“We were able to tie the greening largely to the fertilizing effect of rising atmospheric CO2 concentration by tasking several computer models to mimic plant growth observed in the satellite data,” co-author Prof. Ranga Myneni of the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University said.
Climate scientist Patrick Michaels of the Cato Institute notedthatthe new study from Lowe and Sparrow, as well asthe 2016 study,contradicts conventionalpredictionsthatan increase in CO2 emissions would cause an increaseindead foliage and arid regions throughout the world.
“This may lead to a remarkable hypothesis — that one of the reasons the forested regions were undercounted in previous surveys (among other reasons) is that there wasn’t enough vegetation present to meet Bastin’s criterion for ‘forest,’ which is greater than 10% tree cover, and carbon dioxide and global warming changed that,”Michaels wrote.

"Over the years, the internet which started off as an internal network for the defense sector has become a necessity in life. Many people’s lives rely on the internet and each day, the internet present us all with opportunities which seek to better our lives. Cloud services which are services that are made available to users through the internet from the servers of cloud-computing service providers are one of such services which are supposed to better our lives. Cloud services are easy and provide expandable access to resources, services and applications but are generally managed by a Cloud Services Provider (CSP). These CSPs charge high fees for a limited amount of services making the use of cloud services limited to a few.
Cloudwith.me seeks to solve these problems. Cloudwith.me has taken advantage of the ever-increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple and the Bitcoin to create the perfect cloud for all users. By making the use of pro-cloud services available to all levels of web users with its introduction of the Cloud token, Cloudwith.me has brought cloud services down to earth. The Cloud token which is a Ethereum-based cryptocurrency seeks to become the sole currency for cloud services. It is part of a plan that strives to make cloud services a commodity which can be universally accessible and available through the use of peer-to-peer decentralized offerings.
Cloudwith.me – the company behind the Cloud Token has three main objectives;
* Decentralization of cloud services by migrating from a system operated by a few hyperscale CSPs to a decentralized peer-to-peer infrastructure which will be operated by millions of individual contributors and providers of cloud services.
* Simplification of professional cloud services for all levels of web users by not only making cloud services universally accessible to the entire public but also making it relatively easy to use.
* Use a new and dedicated cryptocurrency – the Cloud token to monetize the new and decentralized ecosystem of cloud services which will enable trusted and automated reconciliation of all peer-to-peer cloud service payments for all providers.
With the achievement of the first objective, the company is presently at the second phase which entails the creation of a decentralized cloud system which will allow cloud-based applications to scale across millions of individuals (CSPs) who by contributing a small amount of their computer resources to become part of a blockchain cloud grid can benefit from continuous income. This decentralized cloud system will not only give millions of cloud usersworldwide the ability to share, operate and benefit financially from any cloud application or service(music, investment or social insuranceservices)but will also provide aprivate and secure environment where transactions can be carried out in aneffective, efficient and trusted manner.
Cloudwith.me will basically change the way cloud computing works. It will create a private, reliable and secure service whereby each member of the cloud community participates in running the cloud by contributing a small amount of his/her cloud storage to the network while earning income each time his/her storage is used. So, the more users participate, the bigger the overall system storage. Also, costs associated with the purchase of cloud storage will be substantially reduced especially with the introduction of the blockchain-based Ethereum cryptocurrency, the Cloud token. With the Cloud token, privacy and unanimity is assured. Also, by storing its data on millions of servers worldwide, Cloudwith.me reduces the risk of cyber-attacks such as hacking which is possible when data is stored on a central server.
By participating therefore in the Cloud ICO, you have a chance to be a part of something that will rewrite the way we interact with cloud computing. And while Cloudwith.me is looking to use our storage space to build a massive decentralized storage center which will also reduce the risk of cyber-attacks and sale of private information through backdoor channels, it offers users a chance to make money in the process. The Cloud token which is the sole currency of the cloud offers users a chance to access all services of the cloud at substantially reduced prices. Therefore, the Cloud token Initial Coin Offering is a not only a chance to make money but is also a chance to be the part of something great.",1

"Heroin use has dramatically increased across the U. S., spreading to groups it hadn't previously reached, and deaths from overdose have soared, according to a new federal report released Tuesday.
Heroin deaths nearly quadrupled in the decade between 2002 and 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Rates of abuse doubled among women and went up 50 percent among men during the same time period.
“Heroin use in the United States increased 63 percent from 2002 through 2013. This increase occurred among a broad range of demographics, including men and women, most age groups, and all income levels,” the CDC says in its report, attributing much of the increase to users who started abusing prescription painkillers and then moved on to heroin.
“What's most striking and troubling is that we're seeing heroin diffusing throughout society to groups that it hasn't touched before,” CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden told NBC News.
“We're seeing heroin affecting people in urban and rural areas, white, black and Hispanic, low middle and high income. We're seeing heroin diffusing throughout society but we can turn this around.”
The reasons are complicated –- drug abuse overall is up, and more people are using prescription painkillers. Heroin is a cheap and more easily available alternative to these prescription drugs for people who become addicted to them.
""They are addicted to prescription opiates because they are essentially the same chemical with the same effect on the brain as heroin,"" Frieden told a news conference. ""Heroin costs roughly 5 times less than prescription opiates on the street.""
“What's most striking and troubling is that we're seeing heroin diffusing throughout society to groups that it hasn't touched before.""
Not only that, but cheaper, purer heroin is coming into the United States. This makes it easier to overdose. “Between 2002 and 2013, the rate of heroin-related overdose deaths nearly quadrupled, and more than 8,200 people died in 2013,” CDC said.
The absolute numbers are still low — fewer than 1 percent of people abuse heroin, CDC said.
For the report, the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC analyzed data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2002–2013. This report captures thousands of Americans, but misses the military, homeless and prison populations. So it may actually understate the extent of the heroin abuse problem.
“Annual average rates of past-year heroin use increased from 1.6 per 1,000 persons aged 12 years or older in 2002–2004 to 2.6 per 1,000 in 2011–2013,” the report reads.
“In 2013, an estimated 517,000 persons reported past-year heroin abuse or dependence, a nearly 150 percent increase since 2007,” CDC added.
“During 2002–2013, heroin overdose death rates nearly quadrupled in the United States, from 0.7 deaths to 2.7 deaths per 100,000 population, with a near doubling of the rates from 2011–2013.”
Heroin kills by causing slow and shallow breathing. Multiple drug use worsens the effect. “People often use heroin along with other drugs or alcohol. This practice is especially dangerous because it increases the risk of overdose,” CDC said.
Heroin users also risk getting infections like HIV and hepatitis.
The report fits in with what other government agencies have been saying.
Last year, the Drug Enforcement Administration found a four-fold increase in heroin seizures along the southwest border since 2008, with 4,653 pounds being confiscated last year.
Frieden says law enforcement needs help stopping it. “The less accessible it is and the more difficult and the more expensive it is to get, the fewer people will use it,” he said.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has reported a steady increase in heroin abuse nationwide, with an estimated 669,000 American users in 2012.
And The Journal of the American Medical Association published a study in 2014 that showed heroin users are changing. While in past decades people from many races used heroin, 90 percent of people who began using in the past decade are white, and many live outside of major cities, the study found.
CDC and FDA found a similar pattern. “During 2002–2011, rates of heroin initiation were reported to be highest among males, persons aged 18–25 years, non-Hispanic whites, those with an annual household income more than $20,000, and those residing in the Northeast,” CDC said.
“Most heroin users have a history of nonmedical use of prescription opioid pain relievers, and an increase in the rate of heroin overdose deaths has occurred concurrently with an epidemic of prescription opioid overdoses.”
Users say they move to heroin after they get addicted to prescription drugs – often during legitimate use for a medical condition – and then their supply dries up.
And it's easy to get addicted to opiate painkillers, Frieden said.
""A few doses and someone can have a life of addiction. A few pills too many and someone can die from an overdose,"" he said.
But that’s not the only reason heroin use is up.
“The highest rate was consistently found among users of cocaine; during 2011–2013, this rate was 91.5 per 1,000,” CDC said.
“The highest rate was consistently found among users of cocaine.""
“Past-year alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and opioid pain reliever abuse or dependence were each significant risk factors for heroin abuse or dependence. Research has identified poly-substance use as a risk factor for overdose death; most overdose deaths involve multiple drugs.”
CDC said states can do a lot more to help fight heroin abuse.
“Specifically, a focus on reducing opioid pain reliever abuse is needed,” it said.
Drug registries, educating doctors and patients, and programs to help people avoid becoming dependent on pain medications can all help. Prescription drug monitoring programs help doctors identify potential abusers. “Providers can analyze patient prescription drug history and make informed decisions before prescribing opioid painkillers,” CDC said.
Some policymakers have worried that tightening access to painkillers might drive addicts to heroin. But Frieden said that's not really true. ""Improving prescribing practices for prescription opiates is part of the solution, not part of the cause, of the heroin problem,"" he said.
Some doctors may be overusing opiate painkillers, Frieden said.
""If someone has sever terminal pain from cancer, you absolutely want to provide pain relief,"" he said. The same goes fpr severe pain from, say, a car crash.
""For chronic, non-cancer pain, you really have to look at the risks and benefits,"" he added. ""And the risks are very, very clear.""
Alternatives include safer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen; physical therapy and even ice, Frieden said.
Wider use of the rescue drug naloxone can also help reduce deaths, CDC said. Naloxone, also known by its trade name Narcan, works within minutes to reverse the effects of an overdose by sticking to brain cells and keeping the drug from getting in.

"The infotainment technology that automakers are cramming into the dashboard of new vehicles is making drivers take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel for dangerously long periods of time, an AAA study says.
The study released Thursday is the latest by University of Utah professor David Strayer, who has been examining the impact of infotainment systems on safety for AAA's Foundation for Traffic Safety since 2013. Past studies also identified problems, but Strayer said the ""explosion of technology"" has made things worse.
Automakers now include more options to allow drivers to use social media, email and text. The technology is also becoming more complicated to use. Cars used to have a few buttons and knobs. Some vehicles now have as many as 50 buttons on the steering wheel and dashboard that are multi-functional. There are touch screens, voice commands, writing pads, heads-up displays on windshields and mirrors and 3-D computer-generated images.
""It's adding more and more layers of complexity and information at drivers' fingertips without often considering whether it's a good idea to put it at their fingertips,"" Strayer said. That complexity increases the overall amount of time drivers spend trying to use the systems.
The auto industry says the new systems are better alternatives for drivers than mobile phones and navigation devices that were not designed to be used while driving.
The vehicle-integrated systems ""are designed to be used in the driving environment and require driver attention that is comparable to tuning the radio or adjusting climate controls, which have always been considered baseline acceptable behaviors while driving,"" said Wade Newton, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.
But Jake Nelson, AAA's director for traffic safety advocacy and research, said drivers took their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel while using infotainment systems in each of the 30 cars and light trucks, all 2017 models, that were tested in the study. The drivers used voice commands, touch screens and other interactive technologies to make calls, send texts, tune the radio or program navigation all while driving.
Clearly automakers haven't worked hard enough to make the systems quick and easy to use, Nelson said. Researchers rated 23 of the 30 vehicles ""very high"" or ""high"" in terms of the attention they demanded from drivers. Seven were rated ""moderate."" None required a low amount of attention to use.
Programming a destination into in-vehicle GPS navigation systems was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task. At 25 mph (40 kph), a car can travel the length of four football fields during the time it takes to enter a destination. Previous research has shown that drivers who remove their eyes from the road for just two seconds double their risk for a crash.
Under pressure from the industry, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2012 issued voluntary safety guidelines to automakers for dashboard technology instead of enforceable safety standards. The guidelines recommend that automakers lock out the ability to program navigation systems while a car is moving. However, the ability to program navigation while driving was available in 12 vehicles in the study.
The guidelines also recommend automakers prevent drivers from texting while driving, but three-quarters of the vehicles tested permit drivers to text while the car is moving. Texting was the second-most distracting task performed by test drivers.
Drivers looked away from the road less when using voice commands, but that safety benefit was offset by the increased amount of time drivers spent interacting with the systems.
AAA said drivers should use infotainment technologies ""only for legitimate emergencies or urgent, driving-related purposes."" It also urged automakers to block the ability to program navigation systems or send texts while driving. Automakers should also design infotainment systems so that they require no more attention to use than listening to the radio or an audiobook, it said.
Nearly 70 percent of U. S. adults say they want the new technologies in their vehicles, but only 24 percent feel that the technology already works perfectly, according to an opinion survey conducted for AAA.
""Drivers want technology that is safe and easy to use,"" said Marshall Doney, AAA's president and CEO, ""but many of the features added to infotainment systems today have resulted in overly complex and sometimes frustrating user experiences for drivers.""",0

Shocking details of starvation, disease, lack of clothing as troops emerge from Valley Forge
The winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1778 proved to be a long and costly one for Gen. George Washington's army during the American Revolutionary War.  (Three Lions/Getty Images)
VALLEY FORGE, PENNSYLVANIA (MARCH 1, 1778) — Winters in Pennsylvania tend to be cold, and this past winter has been no different with its blowing wind and plentiful snow. It appears that a warmer winter could have been wished for by Gen. George Washington and his troops, who have spent this past winter in Valley Forge.
Washington chose the location to settle his troops for the winter becauseit was only 18 miles northwest of Philadelphia, where the British were stationed. A fairly secure location and defensible, it was close enough to keeptabs on their enemy.
It was soon discovered, however, that given the lack of any existing shelter, the lack of food, money, or, in many cases, clothing for the soldiers, the cold Pennsylvania winter would prove to be a long and costly one.
It has been well documented that the Continental Army has been accustomed to being ill-provisioned, frequently lacking food and often not being paid by the Continental Congress, which claims to lack the funds. This winter, however, privation entered an entirely new dimension with multiple sources coming forward to paint a picture of truly bleak circumstances.
The regiment arrived at Valley Forge knowing their only shelter would be ones in which they themselves constructed. Harvesting timber from miles away, the undernourished troops hauled the logs back to the camp to construct rustic cabins that did little more than protect them from the elements.
Healthy soldiers would have found such conditions difficult. The soldiers in this encampment, however, were far from healthy. Lack of food was a continual issue; the soldiers’ primary staple were “firecakes,” which is a tasteless mixture of flour and water. Food from the surrounding farms was sparse, as the farmers were far more eager to sell to the British regiments, knowing they would get a good price for their crops, as opposed to being paid in Continental dollars, which are known to hold far less value. That is if the Congress issued any funds at all. And unlike the British, Gen. Washington was adamantly opposed to his troops simply taking what they needed from farms in the area.
In addition to being malnourished, a large percentage of the troops had shockingly little clothing. Only one in four had shoes, and many had no coats or blankets. It was not uncommon to see men with pants in tatters or clothes in the process of rotting off of their bodies. Many were prevented from doing their duties due to their nakedness, being embarrassed to be seen with so little clothing.
Connecticut soldier James Martin shared his experience as he began the winter:
“The army was now not only starved but naked; the greatest part were not only shirtless and barefoot, but destitute of all other clothing, especially blankets. I procured a small piece of raw cowhide and made myself a pair of moccasins, which kept my feet, while they lasted, from the frozen ground, although, as I well remember, the hard edges so galled my ankles while on a march that it was with much difficulty and pain that I could wear them afterward. But the only alternative I had was to endure this inconvenience or go barefoot, as hundreds of my companions had to, till they might be tracked by their blood upon the rough, frozen ground.”
Gen. Washington, while lamenting the deplorable conditions he and his soldiers were in, couldn’t help but praise them for the character they displayed under such circumstances:
“No history now extant can furnish an instance of an army’s suffering such uncommon hardships as ours has done. To see men without clothes to cover their nakedness, without blankets to lie on, without shoes (for the want of which their marches might be traced by the blood from their feet), and almost as often without provision as with them, marching through the frost and snow, and at Christmas taking up their winter quarters within a day’s march from the enemy, without a house or hut to cover them till they could be built, and submitting to it without a murmur is proof of patience and obedience which in my opinion can scarce be paralleled.”
Washington pleaded repeatedly with the Continental Congress for funds for his troops, but that availed him little. Additionally, America’s loosely coordinated national governmentplaces much of the responsibility for funding on the states, and many of them have not followed through on their agreement, claiming lack of funds themselves.
He was also forced repeatedly to seek provision from quartermaster general Thomas Mifflin, who was ineffectual. Circumstances grew to such a dire state that he demanded Gen. Nathanael Greene replace Mifflin, which Greene was hesitant to do, due to the enormity of the task. Once Greene was in place in March 1778, however, things began to improve for Washington and his men.
Of the 12,000 troops that entered Valley Forge in December 1777, an estimated 2,500 died of starvation, disease, malnutrition, or exposure by the spring.

"Most people who inject illegal drugs don’t always use clean needles, and risk catching HIV and hepatitis as a result, U. S. health officials said Tuesday.
But more than half use a clean syringe at least sometimes, which is progress, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
A CDC analysis from 22 U. S. cities found that 54 percent of people who inject drugs had used a needle exchange program in the past year — up from 36 percent in 2005. But a third said they had shared a needle at least once within the past year.
That's not good enough, the CDC said.
""The prescription opioid and heroin epidemics are devastating families and communities throughout the nation, and the potential for new HIV outbreaks is of growing concern,"" CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden told reporters.
Activists in Indiana, where drug abuse has caused a small outbreak of the AIDS virus in recent years, say they know one reason why many users still are not getting clean needles: Some state governments are making it hard to do so.
Even though Indiana government officials reluctantly eased a ban on syringe exchange programs at the CDC’s urging, they provided no funding for them and are making advocates jump through hoops to get programs started.
The issue pits well-meaning lawmakers against doctors and other public health experts, with a confused public in the middle. CDC and other experts say decades of studies show needle exchange programs work not only to stop the spread of disease, but to help people stop their abuse of drugs such as heroin and other opioids.
Many people, however, are worried about encouraging a deadly practice.
""We do understand that when people first hear about syringe exchange programs, they wonder why anyone would do that,"" Frieden said in a telephone briefing.
""The science shows that syringe service programs work. They save lives and money. Study after study shows they don’t lead to increased drug use or crime,"" he added.
And then there are moral judgments.
""Oftentimes people are against needle exchanges because they believe that people who use drugs have made choices and should suffer certain consequences of those choices,"" said Chris Abert of the Indiana Recovery Alliance, one of the community groups improve access to exchanges.
HIV and hepatitis C both spread via shared needles. In the U. S. 3,900 people become infected each year with HIV because of shared needles — 9 percent of new infections.
""In recent years, injection drug use has also contributed to a 150 percent increase in acute cases of hepatitis C infections,"" the CDC said.
Studies have found that if people can easily get clean needles to use, they’ll wait longer in between fixes. And getting into an exchange program takes them one step closer to getting treated for their drug abuse problems.
Needle exchange programs in big cities are helping, and fewer blacks and Hispanics are becoming infected that way. The spread of both HIV and hepatitis C is now becoming more common in whites, the CDC said.
""Annual HIV diagnoses among black and Hispanic/Latino people who inject drugs were cut in half between 2008–2014, but diagnoses among white people who inject drugs dropped by only 28 percent,"" the CDC said.
""One reason may be that fewer blacks and Hispanics/Latinos are sharing needles and syringes, while whites are more likely to share them,"" the CDC said.
It took an epidemic in Indiana to convince officials there.
Last year, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence — now the vice president-elect — declared a public health emergency and temporarily waived the state's ban on needle-exchange programs.
Yet it’s been slow going to get clean needles to the people who need them, Abert said.
""We have no money allocated from the state,” Abert said.
""It is a very complicated process to get a needle exchange up and started. You have to go through a lot of work to get one going,” Abert said. ""You have to prove you are already in midst of an epidemic of HIV, which is absolutely insane health policy. It’s just a recipe for disaster.""
Groups like Abert’s cobble together funding from philanthropies, some local sources, and donations to provide clean needles and other equipment so that users don’t share.
And there are other roadblocks. ""It is still illegal in Indiana to have a syringe without a prescription,"" Abert said.
""All of our participants, all of our volunteers, could be arrested at any moment,"" Abert said. ""They didn’t change the criminal code.""
Carrie Ann Lawrence of the Indiana School of Public Health says even when counties want to start needle exchange programs, they usually lack even the staff needed to apply for the necessary funding.
""There is absolutely no resource allocation attached to our syringe resource legislation,"" Lawrence said.
Indiana’s epidemic reflects what the CDC found: 43 percent of white drug users surveyed in 2015 said they shared needles.
""The injecting drug users that we saw in Scott County were poor, Caucasian, from rural communities, and with low education levels oftentimes,"" said Lawrence, who’s studied the drug abuse issue in Indiana.",0
"Mother Nature is one creative entity, especially when it comes to fruit. Let’s face it: most major supermarkets stock only the most common fruits like apples, pears, and grapes, but they’re so basic. Why not explore other options, from the stinky-yet delicious durian to the captivating citrus caviar that is finger limes?
Add one more must-try fruit to that list: black sapote, which is unsurprisingly nicknamed “the chocolate fruit” due to its dark, richly hued flesh.
Oh, and the kicker? Black sapote actually does taste somewhat like chocolate pudding, with a similar silky texture and a mild, chocolatey taste. So skip your gluten- and sugar-free alternatives and get out and find one of these fruits, stat.
Black sapote (Diospyros nigra) look like bright-green tomatoes, and are high in vitamins A and C (purportedly having four times the amount of vitamin C found in an orange). As they ripen, the outsides will turn olive green and the insides will deepen and become a dark, rich brown.
While black sapote is native to Mexico and Central America, it’s also grown in the Philippines and other tropical areas. It hasn’t caught on much in the U. S., although it does grow successfully in southern Florida.
It’s a shame, because the sapote’s natural sweetness and outstanding chocolate flavor (have we mentioned that already?) make it a natural fit as a dessert on its own or when added to other recipes.
Throughout my childhood I wondered why fruits and vegetables don’t taste as good as chocolate, not knowing that one actually did: the black sapote. It’s probably the only fruit in the world that comes close to tasting like heaven. Or chocolate pudding. Same thing in my book.
The black sapote doesn’t just taste nice, it’s a dieter’s dream-come-true. Don’t let the name and delicious appearance of this fruit fool you, it is actually very low in fat. It also contains four times the vitamin C found in a single orange, and significant amounts of Calcium and Phosphorus. Interestingly, the black sapote isn’t really a sapote at all. The delicious fruit is a close relative of the persimmon, a fruit that greatly resembles a tomato. While persimmons are red, black sapotes (as the name suggests) are chocolaty dark black on the inside. The sticky texture of the fruit might put you off at first, but the unique flavor of a ripe black sapote is absolutely worth it.
Black sapotes are about two to four inches in diameter and soft when ripe. They grow on lovely trees with shiny dark green leaves and black barks that reach up to 60 foot in height. Native to Mexico and Central America, the trees produce fruit fast – in just three to four years of planting. But they aren’t strictly tropical – they flower and produce fruit even at elevations of 5,000 to 6,000 ft. They also do quite well in most soil conditions.
The fruits are mostly seedless, but sometimes they may contain 5 or 6 penny-sized oval seeds. And if you want to pick up a few seeds to plant in your garden, you need to look directly on the ground under the tree. The trees produce both male and female flowers, so one tree should yield a good crop of fruit. But here’s the trick – you have to know exactly when to pick black sapotes. If it’s done at the wrong time, they will never ripen and will rot in about three weeks. If you wait too long, you might never get to enjoy the fruits because the birds will get to them before you. Experienced pickers will examine each fruit for its maturity, before deciding when it’s time. Once picked, a fruit should be ready to eat in two to ten days.

To enjoy a black sapote, all you need to do is cut one, twist it into halves (like an avocado), and take out great chunks with a spoon. You can eat the flesh plain, with ice cream on the side, or blend it with milk, cream or ice-cream to really bring out that chocolaty goodness. It’s also a popular ingredient for dessrts. I came across quite a few – black sapote pudding with a banana and coconut milk garnish, black sapote mousse, ‘instant’ raw chocolate pudding, cake, and even black sapote liquor. They might sound weird, but the people who put out these recipes swear that the combinations are to-die-for.",1

It seems like it’s getting tougher and tougher for people in hurricane-prone areas to weather those storms. When storms like Harvey and Irma hit the south in 2017, people in the path of the deadly storms found themselves scrambling for supplies. They busied themselves with boarding up windows and stocking up water.
One annoying chore when a storm is coming is getting out to get sandbags. It’s illegal to try and take sand from beaches, parks or other public properties, so homeowners need to find bags and get in line to fill up their sandbags at designated locations. But with thousands of people racing for bags at once, some can’t afford to wait that long.
There’s actually a great solution if you were not able to get sandbags for a coming storm. Facebook user Edward Obediah Sweat posted the idea and it’s now going viral.
“To my Florida friends and family… Some things I learned about hurricane damage management…. Plastic bags 1/3 filled with water make good substitutes for sandbags at doorways.”
The water bags need to be tied well, but they actually work well in conforming to each other across the threshold to stop any floodwaters from getting in.
Sweat offered a few more brilliant tips. He tells you that duct tape is a great way to seal the garage door to the floor of the garage to prevent leakage. If you have any old paint cans in the garage, bring them in and use them to prop up the furniture. That way, if flood waters do get in, your furniture could be spared. Keep a whistle with your flashlights so you can use it to call for help in case of emergency.
Another great idea he offers is to wear your clothes to bed. That way if you are forced to jump up and evacuate in the middle of the night, you won’t have to do it in your pajamas. Now that is good thinking!

"If you’re like me, you check your inbox first thing in the morning and you quickly scan that list of messages. Your brain quickly prioritizes which emails need your attention first, and they all get classified as: read now, read later, or read never — delete.
Throughout the day, we repeat those actions whenever we check our inboxes. Our inboxes are flooded with messages from clients, colleagues, loved ones, and spammers every day. So, how can a business stand out from the pack?
As a marketer, you can take advantage of the “Two-Second Rule” by paying attention to just a few key areas so that people will take action on the email you’ve sent. The “Two-Second Rule” revolves around the idea that we only have two seconds to grab a reader’s attention.
Here are five tips to make the most out of your email marketing efforts:
Is the “from” line easily recognizable? If people associate your name with your business’s name, then you should use both. However, if it’s a large company, then only the company name should be in that line.
Try to cap your subject lines at under 40 characters and fewer than eight words. Make sure that the first two words matter most.
Also, avoid using words like “Free” or “Buy Now” since this language might get picked up by a spam filter and route your email to their junk box instead of their inbox.
Remember, too, that well over 50 percent of emails are now read on mobile devices, and long subject lines will be cut off, so don’t leave the juicy information until the end.
Can you create a sense of urgency in your subject line? If there is a deadline for taking advantage of a discount, or if you are running out of seats for an upcoming event, make sure to include that information in your email as concisely as possible.
Use personal pronouns like “you” or “your” to appeal directly to your consumers. You can also use numbers to break your articles into digestible pieces. For example: “5 Ways to Maximize Your Marketing Budget”
Many email service providers will allow you to write customized pre-header text (or teaser text).
Pre-header text is the text that appears just underneath the subject line while the email is in the inbox.
If you don’t write your own pre-header text, then the first line of copy in your email will be used as pre-header text.
BONUS TIP: Consider the pre-header text extra real estate in someone’s inbox. People love to see their own names in their inboxes and are more likely to open personalized emails. So, use “Dear [First Name]” in the body of your email. It’ll make your customers much more likely to take notice of your message.
Don’t forget to test your email campaign before sending it out.
Preview what it looks like on both your desktop device and your mobile device. It should go without saying that every single email campaign you send out must be mobile-responsive.
Any key actions you want the reader to take should appear above the scroll line. Ensure that the link or action button is not buried at the bottom of your email.
Lastly, pay attention to layout, font size, and colors in your emails to keep readers engaged and subscribed to your email list.

I’m standing in a space the width of an airplane aisle, staring at frying oils. It’s the kitchen of the Stapleton, Colo., location of Next Door, one of the country’s most high-profile casual restaurant companies. Until now, I’ve given very little thought to frying oils. But I’m on a quest for understanding: to get behind the scenes in a kitchen that is equally friendly to gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan and various food-allergic customers as it is to everybody else. At Next Door, eating restrictions don’t just pepper the menu, signaled through such acronyms as “GF” (gluten-friendly), “DF” (dairy-free), “V+” (vegan) and “GFO (gluten-friendly optional). They downright define it. Instead of topping a salad with nuts, Next Door chefs sprinkle on sunflower seeds. Before frying calamari or pickles and pepperoncini, they dredge them in cornstarch or polenta, respectively, instead of the traditional wheat flour. For their veggie bowl, they use quinoa, because it’s a whole grain that doesn’t have gluten.   [I sent in my DNA to get a personalized diet plan. What I discovered disturbs me.]  The chefs also use three separate fryers for dishes that are vegan, vegetarian or that contain gluten and/or seafood (for their twice-weekly beer-battered fish tacos). Nothing gets cooked in the wrong oil. For customers getting the gluten-free hamburger bun, chefs use a different toasting surface. On “the line,” little buckets of salad toppings are arranged to avoid cross-contamination — bacon and dairy toward the bottom row so as not to drop into the innocent ingredients.
Next Door offers gluten-free and other allergen-free dishes, such as the roasted veggie salad above. (Next Door )  Next Door illustrates just one of many ways food sensitivities are driving the culinary decision-making of entire operations: Rather than jury-rigging dishes to respond to special needs, chefs have engineered many menus from the start to eschew everything from soy to gluten. And most customers don’t have a clue. You’ve probably seen pizza places whose menus say in fine print “gluten-free dough available upon request.” Or maybe you’ve had the waiter who, like a customs agent, asks at the beginning of the meal if anyone has allergies to declare.  But after learning about Next Door’s approach, it dawned on me: The afflictions of the minority are starting to determine the options for the majority. And I can’t help but wonder: In response to the dramatic rise in ingredient intolerance — both real and perceived — among American consumers, are all of us bound to be eating less of the foods that, for generations, were the staples of civilization? What does this mean for the future of dining?
At the Little Beet, gluten is nowhere to be found. (The Little Beet)
The eight ingredients that most commonly trigger food allergies are milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soybeans. (Gluten is a protein found in wheat, along with barley, rye and triticale.) About 8percent of children and 5percent of U. S. adults have a food allergy. The rate of people with such allergies is doubling about every decade, and about a quarter of them will have a near-fatal reaction at some point in their lives. About 1percent of Americans have celiac disease, 6percent have non-celiac gluten sensitivity and 33percent are trying to avoid gluten.  Across the country, campus dining operations offer options for students seeking every designation: kosher, halal, vegetarian, vegan. But this year, Cornell University opened an entire dining hall with no trace of gluten, tree nuts or peanuts. At Columbia University, nuts have been removed from all recipes at two dining halls. There, dining directors created “nut zones,” where students use special utensils and dishes to, say, make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or sprinkle walnuts on a salad.  In case you haven’t noticed, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish and fish — five of the top eight food allergens — are nowhere to be found at Chipotle. The same is true of gluten at the Little Beet, a New York-based chain with locations in the District. According to Datassential, nearly 26percent of U.S. restaurant menus now have a “gluten-free” call-out. That’s a 182percent increase over four years.  Most chefs never used to be so accommodating. But today, even in upscale dining realms, options abound. Take chef Marco Canora’s Hearth Restaurant and Brodo Broth Co. in New York City. Although not stated on restaurant materials, accommodation of dietary restrictions is central to Canora’s philosophy. (Gluten-free, vegan and the Whole30 elimination diet are his top concerns.) “If I was a hyper-creative, artistic chef, I might feel a little differently,” he said. But his take has always been that he’s in the service industry, so he’s happy to bend over backward.
Next Door co-founder Kimbal Musk calls for a focus on “real food.” (Lee Williams Custom Photography/The Kitchen)
Next Door was founded in Boulder in 2011 and has five locations in Colorado, one in Memphis and one coming soon to Indianapolis. Co-founder Kimbal Musk has received the lion’s share of the press, but to understand the magic, you have to look to the culinary director, Musk’s right-hand man, who is shaping the dishes. Merlin Verrier came to Next Door after a career in fine dining, having earned several Michelin stars; he’s cooked for celebrities including the Obamas and Oprah Winfrey.  Along with teaching techniques for building flavor — he’s a self-declared “texture freak” — he’s training his growing team to build in allergy and intolerance awareness from the start, as the core of the menu R&D. “Gluten-free outweighs everything, in our opinion,” Verrier said. About two years ago, the company decided gluten-free was here to stay, citing customer demand — though I can’t imagine it was unrelated to one of its own executives’ decision to avoid gluten. Enemy No. 2 is peanuts. Just over a year ago, Next Door eliminated peanut oil. It’s a go-to frying oil in restaurants given its mild flavor and high smoke point, Verrier said, but he switched entirely to canola oil. “I can’t even let my kids bring peanuts to school these days,” he said. “We’re a family restaurant — so how could we have peanut oil?” He went on: “I never saw an EpiPen at school. That wasn’t part of life. But now it is.”  It’s a point of pride, he said, that parents of kids with peanut allergies who won’t go to other restaurants feel safe coming to Next Door. In the prep kitchen and pantry area, I see the log of monthly in-house audits and the self-imposed private health inspections they incur, which Verrier considers 10 times as strict as those done by the local health department.
A Next Door eatery in Denver’s Stapleton neighborhood. (Next Door )  Soy is also not allowed on the premises. No soy milk, no soy sauce. Soy sauce often contains wheat, so it’s a no-go for gluten dodgers too. Next Door and the Little Beet have several other things in common. Neither advertises as being gluten-free, relying on word of mouth. And both consider gluten-free essential to what they call “real food.” But is wheat not “real”? “Real food is food that you trust to nourish your body,” Musk said. “It’s food that you trust to nourish the farmer. And it’s food that you trust to nourish the planet.” The opposite of real food, to Musk, is “industrial food.” After “decades of a slow, sad train wreck,” he said, referring to the obesity epidemic, “people are looking for something else: The gluten-free decisions are just people saying, ‘I’m going to shut that whole industrial food system out of my diet.’”  The thinking at the Little Beet is that many grain-based products that contain gluten happen to be highly processed, what co-founder Andy Duddleston calls “filler.” Instead, the company wants to offer nutritious, intact whole grains. So its chefs developed an ancient grain mix of puffed amaranth, quinoa and Job’s-tears (Chinese pearl barley) that’s become a popular base for its bowls.

To me, gluten-free eating represents the latest phase in America’s long history of selling absence — valuing foods for what they lack, from fat-free and low-sodium to non-GMO and reduced-calorie. Now, most everyone wants peace of mind about what they’re putting in their bodies. But by allowing the absence of allergens to define food itself, are we letting fear go a step too far?  Many of the top eight food allergens — including almonds, whole wheat and salmon — are among the healthiest of foods. In prioritizing food safety for the few, I worry that nutrition for the many might suffer.  I confess to Ruchi Gupta, a food allergy researcher and pediatrician at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago and Northwestern Medicine, that I’m worried that the most shunned items could gradually drop out of the food supply and that lack of exposure could make more people sensitive to them. On the first front, she said, my fears are unfounded: She considers the top eight such established staples that even if every restaurant changed its menu, she can’t imagine grocery stores would ever stop selling them. (Though bread sales and wheat farmers have indeed taken a hit from the gluten-free trend.) On the second front, while unlikely, the science is not yet settled, she said. More research is needed.  Still, the prevalence of “free-from” labels is normalizing food intolerance across the population. They give the impression that there must be something wrong with everyone.  Canora said even he feels frustrated at times: “You get the guy who can’t have alliums, or any dairy, or any meat, or any gluten, and no fat, no vinegar, no fermented anything, and it’s like ... holy s---, I’ll give you a lettuce leaf, but you should have stayed home!”  When I’m feeling more sanguine, I think about the culinary innovation that’s resulted from the restrictions. The puffed amaranth and the polenta dredge. Perhaps there’s a forgotten weed out there that will soon hog the center of your plate. It will be all anyone talks about, but then someone will develop a rash or stomachache and off it will go, the way of the wheat and the nuts. Ah, well, we’ll say. At least it had a good run.

A large number of people have a hard time telling the difference between a healthy, all-natural egg and an unhealthy one. However, it is crucial to know which eggs come from factory chickens, and which from farm chickens.
1.Egg With Dark Orange Yolk
A dark orange yolk usually signifies that the egg is extremely healthy, and most likely to be originating from a chicken farm, where chickens get all of their day light, instead of being stored in big dark rooms with no windows. The farm animals are also given the liberty to consume crickets, grasshoppers, insects, ticks and spiders, which is why their yolks are rich in nutrition.
2.Egg With Yellow Yolk
Eggs with yellow yolks are usually found at supermarkets, and they are eggs that originate from factory chickens, raised in huge factories with nightmarish conditions. There is no sunlight, not enough space, and the rooms are dirty. Apart from that, they are only fed grains, and the chickens that lay these eggs have been hatched from incubators, which isn’t at all a natural process.
3.Egg With Light Orange Yolk
Eggs with a light orange yolks are most likely to come from local groceries, originating from chickens which come from large chicken farms whose conditions aren’t as terrible as the ones in big factories, which are still not that suitable, but tolerable. One basic rule to follow is that the more chickens a farm produces, the lower their quality is.
So for the healthiest egg in the image is number 1!
Not only are eggs that come from local farms much fresher, but the conditions under which the chickens are raised, are far better. These chickens are much healthier and the color of the yolks of their eggs signify this. If you’ve never tasted them, it’s well worth going out of your way to do so. Pass this important information on!

"Washington, DC — The band R. E.M has filed a $2.5 million lawsuit against Donald Trump and Ted Cruz over the unauthorized use of its music.
The incident happened Wednesday on the steps of Capitol Hill as Trump walked to the podium with R. E.M.’s 1987 hit “It’s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)” blaring in the background.
R. E.M. frontman Michael Stipe was outraged after the use of his band’s song at the event.
“Go f–k yourselves, the lot of you — you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men,” Stipe wrote via bassist Mike Mills’ Twitter account. “Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign.”
“The media and the American voter should focus on the bigger picture, and not allow grandstanding politicians to distract us from the pressing issues of the day and of the current Presidential campaign.”
Though the 2.5 million dollar question on everybody’s mind is: Does R. E.M. have a chance winning the case?
NBC News spoke with nationally known and recognized political analyst, Paul Horner, who believes R. E.M. has a strong case.
“Donald Trump and Ted Cruz had no permission to use their music, bottom line,” Horner said. “Trump and Cruz are supposed to be role models and set an example as they run for the highest office in this country; they should have known better.”
R. E.M. released “It’s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)” on their 1987 album Document, the 1988 compilation Eponymous, and the 2006 compilation And I Feel Fine.",1
"Guess What Could Be in Your Toilet. Okay so imagine you got out of bed in the middle of the night to use the restroom. Half asleep you just go in and sit down on the toilet. Little do you know that while you’ve been sleeping a giant python has been crawling up your pipes and has found it’s way to your toilet. Scary scenario right? Well this actually happened in Singapore.
A woman in Singapore got a shocking surprise when she sat down to use the restroom earlier this month. The 34-year-old Noraslinda Asat told AsiaOne that she felt a sharp pain right after sitting down on the toilet in main bathroom in her home. After standing up she realized that she was in pain because she had just been bitten by the snake that was hanging down from her leg. She was immediately taken to the hospital and was treated for the bite. Animal control wasn’t able to get the snake that had cause the bite but according to Asat it was a brown python that measured at least six feet in length.
This is a very scary thought to think about and makes me not want to go to any country where a snake can just crawl its way into my toilet and wait for me to come sit down. This defiantly isn’t the first time that something like this had happened. Last July, a man was hospitalized in Israeli after a snake bit him in the genitals. They think that it had crawled up the plumbing system through a crack in the septic tank. All I know is that I am looking before I sit from now on.",1
"Put all the pecan nuts for the pastry and the meringue in a food processor and blend until fine. Weigh out 15g (oz) for the pastry and set aside the remainder.
For the pastry, add the flour, salt and butter to the food processor. Tip in the pecan nuts and pulse until the ingredients are combined and resemble breadcrumbs. Add a tablespoon of cold water and pulse again. Keep adding more water a tablespoon at a time until the mixture comes together as a dough.
Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease a 8in pie dish. For the filling, lightly beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl. Add the pumpkin purée, sugar, cinnamon, orange zest and juice. Beat until combined. Pour in the evaporated milk and then blend everything together using a handheld blender. Set aside.
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface until in thick. Line the pie dish with the pastry, taking care to push the pastry into the edges. Leave any excess overhanging and lightly prick the base using a fork (do not go through to the tin). Place on a baking tray.
Cover the pastry with baking paper and fill with ceramic baking beads or uncooked rice. Bake on the middle shelf for 10 minutes or until the pastry is dry. Remove from the oven and trim any excess pastry so that they are no higher than the pie tin.
Pour in the filling so that only 5mm/in of the pastry can be seen at the top.
Increase the oven temperature to 390F. Bake the pie in the centre of the oven for 15 minutes. Turn the oven down to 320F and bake for a further 30 minutes or until the filling is firm (a slight wobble in the center is fine).
For the meringue, put the egg whites in the bowl of a large freestanding mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (you can also use a mixing bowl and a hand mixer, but it is much easier and safer to add the syrup when you have both hands free). Place the sugar and 100ml (3fl oz) water in a saucepan. Place over a low heat and use a sugar thermometer to measure the temperature of the syrup. When the syrup mixture reaches 210F, begin whisking the egg whites.
When the syrup reaches 240F, remove it from the heat. With the motor running, slowly pour the syrup down the side of the bowl into the mixer, taking care not to touch the whisk as it may splash. Continue to whisk until shiny and stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.
After baking, leave the pie to cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Spoon the meringue onto the pie and use a palette knife to smooth into a dome. Use a chef’s blowtorch to brown the top of the meringue.
For the syrup, combine the orange juice and sugar in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Measure the temperature using a sugar thermometer and when it reaches 240F remove it from the heat. To decorate the pie, dip a fork into the caramel and carefully drizzle over the pie in a cross-hatch pattern (melted sugar is very hot – take care not to burn yourself). Serve the pie warm.",0
"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has echoed Putin’s claim that a chemical ‘false flag’ attackwas orchestratedby the West in order to justify U. S. military interventionin Syria.
In an exclusive interview with AFP, Assad says that he believes the U. S. government orchestrated the attack, claiming that“definitely, 100 percent for us, it’s fabrication.”
“Our impression is that the West, mainly the United States, is hand-in-glove with the terrorists. They fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack.” Assad toldAFP.
[Putin: ‘95% Of World Terrorist Attacks Are Orchestrated By The CIA’]
The Syrian leader also welcomed an investigation, but only if the probe into the attack remained impartial.
“We can only allow any investigation when it’s impartial, when we make sure that unbiased countries will participate in this delegation in order to make sure that they won’t use it for politicized purposes.” Assad said.
But Assad said evidence came only from “a branch of Al-Qaeda,” referring to a former jihadist affiliate that is among the groups that control Idlib province, where Khan Sheikhun is located.
Images of the aftermath, showing victims convulsing and foaming at the mouth, sent shockwaves around the world.
But Assad insisted it was “not clear whether it happened or not, because how can you verify a video? You have a lot of fake videos now.”
“We don’t know whether those dead children were killed in Khan Sheikhun. Were they dead at all?”
He said Khan Sheikhun had no strategic value and was not currently a battle front.
“This story is not convincing by any means.”
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has begun an investigation into the alleged attack, but Russia on Wednesday blocked a UN Security Council resolution demanding Syria cooperate with the probe.
And Assad said he could “only allow any investigation when it’s impartial, when we make sure that unbiased countries will participate in this delegation in order to make sure that they won’t use it for politicised purposes.”
He insisted several times that his forces had turned over all chemical weapons stockpiles in 2013, under a deal brokered by Russia to avoid threatened US military action.
“There was no order to make any attack, we don’t have any chemical weapons, we gave up our arsenal a few years ago,” he said.
“Even if we have them, we wouldn’t use them, and we have never used our chemical arsenal in our history.”
The OPCW has blamed Assad’s government for at least two attacks in 2014 and 2015 involving the use of chlorine.
The Khan Sheikhun incident prompted the first direct US military action against Assad’s government since the war began, with 59 cruise missiles hitting the Shayrat airbase three days after the suspected chemical attack.
Assad said more US attacks “could happen anytime, anywhere, not only in Syria.”
But he said his forces had not been diminished by the US strike.
“Our firepower, our ability to attack the terrorists hasn’t been affected by this strike.”",1
"am fully expecting Harborne Kitchen to be embarrassingly empty on a Thursday lunchtime; in a largely residential neighbourhood, it’s certainly not competing on price with the reliable charms of the Pizza Express a few doors down. Indeed, from the outside, it has all the allure of a high-street dental surgery.
But I’m wrong: it’s two-thirds full. My friend, a local in this leafy bit of Brum, takes great pleasure in informing me that there’s a Michelin-starred rival just down the road, “next to the charity shop, opposite the bank”, a revelation that blows my tiny London mind – as, I suspect, was the intention. Gloves off, I think: Birmingham means business.
For a restaurant such as this to pull people in midweek as well as on Saturday night, it needs to get more than just the food right. Here, it isn’t the space, which has the smart but soulless decor of a well-kempt office (“You’ve obviously never worked in Birmingham,” the friend says). Instead, it’s the people who make the difference. The cheery chap manning the clipboard recognises my friend from a previous visit (or convincingly pretends to), the young brigade in the open kitchen greets us as we pass, and the waiter compliments me on my choice of wine in a way that makes me feel, briefly but gratifyingly, extremely clever.
Though Harborne Kitchen’s website describes the place, quite truthfully, as an “informal neighbourhood restaurant” (no tablecloths, proper bar snacks), the food itself is anything but casual. Kidderminster-born chef-patron Jamie Desogus, who insists that he’s not chasing recognition from any French tyre companies, has nevertheless talked of having a “lightbulb moment” at the Michelin-starred Clove Club in that London and, in my neck of the woods at least, not many neighbourhood joints serve three different tasting menus at lunchtime.
From the moment the yeasted butter arrives on a large stone, it’s clear this is a kitchen with ambition. There are a few similar modish touches that border on gimmickry (while I applaud the waste-not-want-not sentiment that turns fish skins into amuse-bouches, to call the resulting cod crisps “quavers” is a stain on the good name of those potato puffs), but there’s enough solid skill here to bring off some pretty bold cooking.
A classic, velvety chicken liver parfait is given a modern makeover with slices of pickled peach and crunchy seeds, while a screamingly green watercress velouté with thick cultured cream and glossy herring roe is as beautiful as it is simple. Two cuts of buttery confit duck are well served by a richly savoury shiitake broth and cubes of peppery Sichuan pepper jelly, the Chinese flavours wittily pointed up by a garnish of earthy, deep-fried kale (or crispy seaweed, if you prefer). A sweet, herbaceous nettle granita that garnishes the blackcurrant and yoghurt palate cleanser is hands down the best iteration of that generally tedious weed I’ve come across.
There are a couple of less successful dishes: some skilfully cooked but overpoweringly salty morsels of blonde ray and pork cheek with pineapple and coriander wows on the plate more than the palate; and a deconstructed plum cheesecake that I would happily have dispensed with in favour of second helpings of its accompaniments – nutty puffed wild rice (“like the best breakfast cereal ever”) and a pair of clean, intensely flavoured rice and plum ices. But, we agree, better to aim for those stars and occasionally miss, than to settle for a life of safe suburban dough balls.
Harborne Kitchen isn’t cheap – food of this complexity can’t be produced by two chefs and a microwave – and it’s not perfect, either. Sometimes it tries just that bit too hard, and the kitchen could do with a little more confidence in knowing when to leave a good thing well alone. But this would be impressive stuff in the city centre, let alone in B17, sandwiched between a mobile phone shop and a dry cleaners. A five-course tasting menu, a new handset and a freshly pressed suit, all in your lunch break: this, surely, is the Midlands Engine at its fuel-efficient best.
 Harborne Kitchen 175 High Street, Harborne, Birmingham B17, 0121-439-9150. Open lunch, Thurs-Sat, noon-3pm; dinner Tues-Sat 5.30pm-11pm. 28.50 for three courses, tasting menus from 35, all plus drinks and service.",0
"There are all kinds of challenges that small businesses face and cash flow is one of the major ones. Whether you’re a start-up business or you’ve been operating a little while now, one thing which can really help that you may want to look into, is trade finance.
Trade finance is designed to help tide you over while you’re waiting for invoices to be paid.
You’ll likely have already discovered the common problem all small businesses in the trade sector face: An order comes through, so you need to get the goods from your supplier. However, the supplier requires immediate payment, but you need to wait potentially 30 days before your customers pay you. This can leave a significant cash flow issue. That’s where trade finance steps in.
It’s basically similar to a payday loan, where you receive a sum of money and you pay it back in full, plus a little interest on an agreed day. With trade finance however, you use your trade deal as proof of income and you can be paid part or all of the invoice in advance; allowing you to pay your suppliers without worrying about being short of funds.
So, you’re being paid what you should be anyway, only it gives you access to the funds much quicker.
What are the benefits?
So, why is trade finance worth looking into? Well, it provides convenience, flexibility, continuous cash flow, and security.
As soon as you’ve set up a line of credit with a trade finance company such as Touch Financial, you’ll easily be able to take advantage of it as and when you need it.
However, it’s the fact it allows you to keep a continuous cash flow that’s the real benefit. This is one of the biggest struggles which come from starting up a trade business. Many companies have been forced to close their doors because they couldn’t afford to bridge that initial payment gap.
Overall, trade finance is becoming much more popular these days. In a time where it’s difficult to get the finance you need through traditional methods such as via the bank, these trade finance deals are an excellent alternative. Provided you use a reliable company, you should find the interest rates to be very reasonable too.",1
"According to a recentsurveyconducted by cannabis market research firm theBrightfield GroupandHelloMD, an online medical cannabis community, nearly half of CBD (cannabidiol) users give up prescriptiondrugs and over-the-counter medications in favor of the non-psychoactive substance.
The survey of over 2,400 respondents found forty-two percent of CBD users — whether they used marijuana-derived CBD or hemp-derived CBD —“have left their traditional medications behind altogether and now use cannabis instead.”
The survey summarized that roughly“66% of CBD users indicated that CBD products are either ‘more effective’ or ‘much more effective’ in relieving their medical conditions than are over-the-counter (OTC) products.”
Further, “[a]pproximately 52% of this consumer group indicated that their CBD products are either ‘more effective’ or ‘much more effective’ in relieving medical conditions than are prescription medications.”
Common conditions users have employed CBD to treat includejoint painandinflammation, insomnia,depression, and, most often,anxiety. Preliminary research on CBD shows the cannabis derivative can be effective at treating some of these ailments.
When given the option to list “other” uses, survey respondent frequently cited “menstrual cramps, skin concerns, diabetes, ADHD, and stomach issues (IBS, loss of appetite, etc.).”
Respondents expressed satisfaction with the quality of treatment CBD provides:
When asked about medical relief, more than four out of five CBD users found cannabis to work either extremely effectively or very effectively against their various conditions. Each of the individual categories under the CBD umbrella fared well, with the vast majority (82-83%) of users experiencing effective relief with the use of hemp-derived CBD, CBD-dominant and marijuana-derived CBD-only products to help treat their conditions.
Ninety percent reported they were likely to buy plant-derived CBD products again, and many reported using a variety of products rather than just one. Most reported vaping as their preferred means of administering their medication.
One of the chief complaints about CBD was that plant-derived CBD was more effective than hemp-derived CBD but that the former is more expensive than the latter (still, slightly more respondents said hemp CBD was more effective at treating nausea, whereas plant CBD was reportedly more effective at treating arthritis).
Indeed, in the Los Angeles area, for example, a half-gram of plant-derived CBD can cost as much as$50. The higher the CBD ratio, thehigher the price.
Even so, HelloMD notes that due to the “entourage effect,” CBD can actually be more effective when administered with other cannabinoids, like well-known THC (and vice-versa). One preliminarystudyof cannabis’ anti-tumor effects found the substance’s effectiveness increased when CBD and THC were combined.
Cannabis, in general– not just CBD —poses a major threatto a variety of industries, namely Big Pharma. One analysis has found that the pharmaceutical industry could lose as much $4 billion per year in profits as cannabis continues to be legalized. Another survey of cannabis users conducted by researchers from UC Berkeley and Kent State Universityfoundthat “Ninety-seven percent of the sample ‘strongly agreed/agreed’ that they are able to decrease the amount of opiates they consume when they also use cannabis, and 81% ‘strongly agreed/agreed’ that taking cannabis by itself was more effective at treating their condition than taking cannabis with opioids.”
If and when cannabis becomes part of the mainstream healthcare industry, the pharmaceutical industry couldlosebillions of dollars. Unsurprisingly, pharmaceutical company Insys Therapeutics, which has profited off the powerful and dangerous opioid fentanyl, alsomanufacturesa synthetic cannabis product and has lobbied to keep cannabis illegal in Arizona).
Of course, the recent survey has at least one limitation in that it was conducted among people who clearly value cannabis enough to join an online cannabis community, meaning that the reported figures might be lower among the general population that has used cannabis.
Even so, research increasingly confirms the survey’s findings, and as cannabis becomes increasingly acceptable and available, it’s likely CBD will continue to change the way people treat their health issues.
All the while, the DEA continues to assert that CBD isillegal(even though hemp CBD is widely available online) because it is derived from the marijuana plant, ignoring the fact that it is non-psychoactive and is providing relief to a majority of people who use it — without the serious side effects that come with many government-approved treatments.

"At Bindle & Keep, Daniel Friedman and Rae Tutera create impeccable suiting for gender-noncomforming clients.
When Rae Tutera was twenty-five years old, they had their first suit made. It was not a pleasant experience. Tutera, who is transgender and goes by the pronouns “they” and “them,” is now thirty-one, and recalls how uncomfortable they felt trying to explain dimensions and desires to a tailor in a stuffy haberdashery in the East Fifties in Manhattan. “It was the kind of place where they had to buzz you in, and I had never been buzzed into a business in my life,” Tutera remembered.
We were sitting at a rustic wooden table in a small, bright studio inside an industrial building near an overpass in Clinton Hill, the headquarters of the Brooklyn bespoke-suiting shop Bindle & Keep. The room smelled like tweed and pencil shavings, with a faint whiff of palo santo. Tutera, who works as both a clothier and a public ambassador for Bindle & Keep, and Daniel Friedman, the company’s founder and head tailor, together have built a new kind of business: an inclusive, nonjudgmental outfitter, one that provides impeccable suiting for all kinds of bodies.
I am here because Bindle & Keep is the subject of a new documentary on HBO called “Suited” (to air on June 20th), which follows Tutera and Friedman, along with several of their gender-nonconforming clients, over the course of a year. The film, which premièred at Sundance this year, was directed by Jason Benjamin, a longtime television boom operator who worked most recently on “Girls.” (Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner also produced “Suited” for HBO.) It is a sunny, tender valentine to the idea of fashion as a path to fortitude. We see clients from all backgrounds, and with all types of bodies, turning to Bindle & Keep—sometimes giddy, sometimes nervous, always vulnerable—for three-piece armor to wear during the epic moments of their lives: job interviews, bar mitzvahs, landmark legal cases, weddings. Though the film can be a bit gauzy and saccharine when it comes to the big outfit reveals in the mirror, there is one clear takeaway from watching Friedman and Tutera do their jobs: Bindle & Keep is much more than just a place to buy a suit. The shop is part atelier and part therapist’s office (down to the unpublished address); every new consultation takes two hours and is completely private. During that time, clients can both express anxieties about their bodies and revel in their own unique proportions. “Everyone is triggered by something about their own body,” Friedman said, “whether they are a teen who is transitioning or a cisgender man who feels like their body is, for some reason, irregular. There are no body types that we don’t take. This is all just measurements. And we can measure any body.”
The idea for a more compassionate bespoke operation came to Tutera in the middle of that first fateful midtown fitting: “I was standing there in a super-cis, straight men’s tailoring environment. It took a lot of coaxing just to get them to make me a men’s suit. I had to keep contextualizing myself, and I had to do it as all these men were coming into the storefront. I remember thinking at the time, ‘I can barely tell this tailor I am thinking of getting top surgery, let alone in this very public setting.’ I just had to keep telling him to minimize my chest in whatever way he could. I always tell people to act braver than they feel, but, at that moment, I was already doing my best impression of a brave person, and I couldn’t go any further.”
And yet, as soon as Tutera stepped into the gray wool suit, everything changed. “That suit introduced me to my body, which was a very profound moment.” Tutera sports a fade cut and has handsome, sharp cheekbones and a gravelly, soft-spoken voice. In another era, they might have been called a real salt-of-the-earth type. “Seeing myself in something that fit for the first time made me see myself differently. I started to groom myself, and felt more comfortable being seen and engaging with other people. That was when I started to think about replicating that experience for others.”
It took Tutera a year to decide to get into the suiting business, and to research independent tailors who might want to apprentice someone who wanted to learn how to fit transgender and non-binary bodies. When they e-mailed Friedman, who started Bindle & Keep in 2011, the two clicked right away. Friedman, who is bespectacled and slight (“Both Daniel and I fit better into clothes from the boys’ department,” Rae joked), turned to tailoring after a bizarre brain disorder suddenly diminished his reading comprehension. He was on a prestigious academic track, studying architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, and “one day, I could no longer make out a single sentence or write. I went to countless neurologists for years, and no one could explain this late-stage learning disability,” he said. “By 2009, I had left school and was sleeping on friends’ couches trying to figure out how to survive. I had lived for prose up until then, and, when it was gone, I didn’t know how life could be beautiful again.”
Ultimately, Friedman learned that the cause for his symptoms was lead poisoning, but by then his brain was permanently impaired. Now he can read words only if he does so aloud, but his speech is unaffected, and he talks with great urgency, all hand gestures and full paragraphs. He began a suiting business out of his living room to make some money in a profession that didn’t require reading, but, when he collided with Tutera, he realized that his misfortunes had led him to a noble mission. “I was getting sicker and sicker, and my only way of feeling good about myself was to make other people feel good,” he said. “And I find it all ended up connecting; I suffered tremendously, so I created this company and ended up working with Rae, and we’ve helped so many people with their own personal challenges. My workaround opened up this whole new world that so needed this. We didn’t create this market; this market found us.”
Bindle & Keep uses old-fashioned tailoring methods to make its suits (and an ethical workshop in Thailand, which brings the cost of each suit down to about eight hundred dollars). It is a modern shop, however, in that its way of making suits that are truly androgynous derives from an understanding of the ways in which most men’s suits fall short when women (and transgender men) try to wear them off the rack. “Women, for the same body mass as men, are two inches narrower in the shoulders,” Friedman said. “This is proportional to the rib cage. So, to get a jacket to close over the chest, they usually need to get a jacket from the men’s section that’s larger than the body frame. So that throws them off, and instead of a suit being gender-neutral, it becomes hyper-gendered.”
Tutera jumped in to finish the thought. “Yeah, it slopes off the shoulders and doesn’t look right. It’s a design flaw. We try to remind folks who come in that there is no one silhouette that is ‘your silhouette.’ It has nothing to do with you if you go into a store and can’t find something that fits. A lot of people come in with that shame, but a custom suit, and custom clothes, can be the most accelerated ways of getting people out of that shame.” This is the unlikely potential of a place like Bindle & Keep: the tailors recognize that suits, while inherently tied to a long lineage of male-dominated environments, contain a sartorial potency—the timeless power of looking sharp, put-together, complete—that can be imbued to people of all genders.
Tutera, who is big on astrology and other “witchy” pursuits, recently went to have their aura photographed in Chinatown with Everett, a transgender man and law student featured in the documentary who came to Bindle & Keep for a suit to wear during job interviews. (Everett has since landed a fellowship at a transgender-rights law center.) Everett’s aura was purple (“he looked like the Northern Lights, which means he is very special”), and Tutera’s was red, with a dot of yellow inside. “It means I am burning off a lot of energy,” Tutera said. “And that I am hatching a plan.”Friedman, who is expecting the movie to bring in more business than ever before, gently urged Tutera not to have a new plan quite yet.

"As traditional retailers and restaurant chains struggle, Panera Bread says it has hit a milestone that puts it at the forefront of the digital revolution.
The chain, known for healthy fare like sandwichesand salads, said itsdigital sales have soared above $1 billion on an annualized basis and are on track to be twice as high in two years. As a result, Panera says it can lay claim to having the highest rate of digital sales of any non-pizza restaurant chain. But its success isn't lost on rivals.
Sales from mobile, Web and kiosk made up 26% of the company’s total sales, Panera said, and an estimated 1.2 million digital orders are placed per week.
""They’ve been a pioneer in a lot of this stuff. That’s thegood news,"" said Jack Russo, a senior analyst at brokerage Edward Jones. ""The bad news is everyone is copying them.""
Panera's sales claim comes as customers have gravitated to their smartphones for just about every transaction, which they use to order either for takeout or home delivery. As Panera has grown, many traditional full-service eateries have seen their sales decline even as they attempt to cash in on digital sales as well.
Panera said it traces its digital success to an initiative that it began in 2014 calledPanera 2.0, the company'smobile-payment system anddigital-ordering strategy,
""We had always assumed digital will be athird of our business. I'm confident it will be,"" said President Blaine Hurst. ""The question is how high will it be for Panera? The pizza guys are in the 40s. I could see Panera at 50%.""
Customers can use a computer or mobile device to order food and then pick it up in the stores, a program called Rapid Pickup. The same technology fuelsin-store kiosks where they choose what they want to eat.
St. Louis-based Panera continues to roll out delivery from its stores, a feature that adds about $5,000 in extra sales to existing stores after three to six months, according to Hurst.
""That is 99.99% digital, Occasionally, ittakes a phone order. It's marketed as digital,"" he said.
Digital is also a big chunk of Panera's catering business. In 2014, digital was 15% of sales, Now, it's about half, Hurst explained.
Panera was an early adopter of digital and that translated into success, because time is money and money is money.
""Everyone is time-starved,"" said John Gordon, principalof Pacific Management Consulting Group. For brands that are able to amp up their digital sales, ""thatmeans more profit.""
Panera's thorough embrace of digital made it attractive to JAB, theLuxembourg investment firm which controls the Krispy Kreme doughnut chainand coffee brands like Keurig and Caribou. JAB is buying Panera for more than $7 billion, paying $315per share, and plans totake the chain private.
Other restaurant chains are also getting savvy about looking to digital as a way to attract customers.
Chipotle said its first-quarter digital orders accounted for about 8% of the $1.07 billion in sales -- and 8% representeda 53% increase from the same period the year before.
Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts, for example, offer mobile to their loyalty-program members only. In thesecond quarter, of 2017 Starbucks' mobile transactions atU. S. company‐operated retail storeswere 29% of total transactions -- up from24% the same time the previous. For Dunkin Donuts, On-the-Go ordering was close to 2% of total salesduring the first quarter of 2017; the company hasn't released data from the preceding year.
The company,as of late March,had2,042 locations in 46 states and Canada, operating asPanera Bread, Saint Louis Bread Co. or Paradise Bakery & Cafe.",0
"When sensitive liberals spotted the Christian flag flying next to the American flag at a Texas high school, they immediately contacted the district and demanded the “offensive” religious symbol’s removal. However, as soon as students heard their ultimatum, they took matters into their own hands and arrived at class with something even better.
Despite our nation’s founding on religious freedom, the atheist minority tries to impose their ideological beliefs on the Christian majority at every turn. While Christians often sport religious symbols, in accordance with their First Amendment rights, liberal atheists maintain that they should be forced to adhere to their stance against all religions. Although they claim to be religiously neutral, they enforce their non-belief by infringing upon others’ liberties.
Disturbingly, this mentality that since they don’t want to sport religious symbolism, no one else should be allowed to, has made its way onto school campuses with children as their targets. However, despite this very vocal minority attempting to impose their ideology on a high school, students showed them that they’re more than willing to stand up for their religious freedoms.
KETK reports that once the atheists of the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) demanded that a Texas school district removes all religious symbols from its premises, including a Christian flag, students arrived at LaPoynor High School sporting 3 more massive Christian flags to inform the atheists that they won’t allow them to dictate their freedoms.
Students secured the flagpoles to their vehicles after the Wisconsin-based atheist organization issued a letter narcissistically declaring their demands to the East Texas school. The overreaching ultimatum came after atheists received a complaint from a student that the school had allowed students to organize their yearly “See You at the Pole” event in which the youths gathered around the flagpole to pray for their school, community, and nation.
Complaints from the FFRF are outlined below:
1) During the school’s SYATP event, a Christian flag was placed on one of the flag poles. The FFRF says it’s unconstitutional for the school to display the flag bearing the Latin cross.
2) The district also promoted their SYATP event on their district’s social media pages, which the FFRF said violates the Establishment Clause.
3) The organization also said it was brought to their attention that the district’s Facebook page and website promoted their annual baccalaureate ceremony with a picture of a diploma on top of an opened Bible. They also claimed this violated constitutional law.
Incredibly, students didn’t wait for their school to issue a response before defending their liberties. On October 18, a group of students arrived with flags waving to demonstrate their right to peacefully express their beliefs, according to The Christian Post.
“This is our way of life for me and everybody around here,” high school junior Gunner Gracey told KETK.
Fellow junior Jared Sanchez told the local NBC affiliate that although FFRF is going to try to remove the Christian flag, “we’re going to fight for it.”
Holley Franklin, a LaPoynor High School parent and former student, told KETK that she went to school at LaPoynor from kindergarten through 12th grade and asserted that “Jesus has always been alive and well here.”
“If God is challenged, He is up for the challenge and God is going to win,” parent Shaine Snyder told the news outlet.
Although not one student stood when the superintendent asked if anyone wished for the flag to be removed, the FFRF is continuing their attack on students in an effort to prohibit them from organizing and leading religious events, hypocritically claiming that they are taking steps to “remedy these constitutional violations.”
Fearful of a lawsuit, the school district has issued a generic response that doesn’t provide any guarantee that they will protect the majority of their students from one complaining atheist student and the vicious FFRF.
“LaPoynor ISD is in receipt of a letter from the Freedom From Religion Foundation in which they take issue with some district practices regarding religious expression. As always, we appreciate members of our community bringing any matters of concern to our attention. We are in the process of reviewing the concerns addressed in the correspondence and will take any action deemed necessary. LaPoynor ISD is committed to achieving an appropriate balance between permissible religious expression and the obligation to maintain neutrality in its policies and practices,” the statement reads.
It’s absolutely outrageous that this detestable organization seeks to take away the religious rights of the majority of the school’s students simply because one bitter atheist complained. Of course, this student wasn’t forced to participate in the prayer, but, since they disagree with Christianity, they believe Christians shouldn’t be allowed to pray either. The atheist group’s infringement is no different than if one religious zealot tried to force a non-religious majority to adhere to their beliefs.
As disturbing as it is that this tiny minority is bullying high school students in an effort to repress their religious freedoms, it is a good lesson for them to learn early. Undeniably, this liberal indoctrination rules our education system, especially college campuses, and these students are learning to combat this socialistic mindset while peacefully standing up for their beliefs and their constitutional rights.",1
"Arbonne Shakes are made from vegan ingredients including pea protein and rice. The are available in chocolate or vanilla and claim tests have shown they are high in good fats and low in glycemic index. You can find more information at http://healthguidereviews.info/arbonne-shake-review-does-it-work/.
The protein powder can be conveniently mixed with water and offer excellent benefits from this plant protein blend. Let’s look at the claims and the truth about Arbonne Shakes.
These shakes have an additive known as Inner G-Plex which is a combination of different ingredients, including:
This is a source of energy that the body uses, but there are mixed opinions on how effective it is. The FDA has not approved it as a source to treat any symptoms and consumer health studies have shown that many brands either add 75% more of this ingredient or 75% less.
The FDA has reported that this herb is often unsafe by weakening the immune system and is often contaminated. Tests have shown an increased rate of GME alfalfa, and their many strains, are resistant to pesticides and can be potentially dangerous.
This is a popular mineral found in seaweed and is often a chosen replacement by vegans and vegetarians for missing nutrients.
If this ingredient is used too often, it can cause Ginseng Abuse Syndrome, which can lead to high blood pressure, rashes, confusion and many other health issues.
These shakes have 9 grams of sugar added. If you are an average sized woman, the most you should take in is 24 grams, therefore 2 servings of these shakes will equal 18 grams of sugar which are close to the recommended amount. Arbonne has stated that their shakes are certified to have a very low effect on blood sugar.
With 160 calories, that’s higher than the average amount in the average meal replacement shake. You would have to work out a longer period of time to burn off these calories. You are better off using a low-calorie drink which will help you stay at your daily requirement.
It’s high in purines which produce uric acid. This could lead to malfunctions of the joints and kidneys. It is a protein that is low in essential amino acids and it’s highly recommended you do not take this ingredient on its own.
This is a very expensive protein which only offers 25% to 30% protein. As there have been practically not studies performed on this ingredient, it’s unknown how well it will digest or what additional benefits might exist.
This protein quickly digests and can lead to nausea and diarrhea if consumed over the recommended amount. It is quite low in amino acid and should not be taken without other protein sources.
Arbonne Vegan Protein Blend is equating itself with other protein drinks that offer more amino acids. With a lack of information regarding cranberry protein and the fact that this source has less protein than other sources, it’s is truly hard to measure. Rice and pea proteins are added to make up for the lack of other amino acids.
There are other proteins that will not increase inflammation and other leading digestive problems. Although 20 grams may seem extensive, it’s more important to look at the amino acid content which Arbonne does not list the exact amounts.
Since no studies have been performed on the amino acid content in cranberry protein, and Arbonne does not list the amount; it is hard to determine whether you are getting a decent product for the price.
An average bag is $69.99 that provides 30 servings, and it’s recommended that you consume two servicing per day. Therefore, you are getting 15 days of shakes.
That equates to: $69.99 divided by 15 = $4.66 per day.
Their high sugar content equals 18 grams of sugar per 2 servings. That is equal to 4-1/2 teaspoons of sugar per day. High levels of sugar can lead to obesity, an increase in blood sugar and can be addictive. This goes against the claim that the shake will not produce an unsteady rise in blood sugar.
The highest negative feedback from consumers is the taste and is too sweet. Plant protein does not mix well in comparison to other protein blends and that’s why there is more sugar added to make up for flavor. The whole reason for this shake is the replacement of dairy protein with plant protein to appease vegans and vegetarians.",1
"In a shocking announcement reported in The Air Force Times, it has been revealed that 14 Air Force airmen who were the main line of defense between a nuclear disaster and regular life are being investigated. Their alleged crime? According to defense officials, the charge is “illegal drug activity” while on duty acting as security for a nuclear base:
It’s the latest scandal to hit the Air Force’s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile community, where morale and misconduct have been a top concern for Pentagon officials for several years.
The Air Force is investigating 14 junior enlisted airman from the 90th Security Forces Group, at F. E. Warren Air Base outside Cheyenne, Wyoming, officials said. About one-third of the Minuteman 3 force of 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles are operated by the 90th Missile Wing.
The squadron provides security for the base as well as the launch control facilities and underground missile silos spread across the sparsely populated region. In February, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work visited F. E. Warren and the squadron provided a demonstration of the techniques and equipment they would use to recapture a missile silo that had been taken over by intruders.
Those 14 airman, ranging from E-2 to E-4, have been suspended from their duties while their cases are being investigated.
“It came to light because one airman who had suspicion of drug activity by anotherreported that to his chain of command,” said Gen. Robin Rand, commander ofAir Force Global Strike Command.
The allegations were “credible” and involved drug activity by airman during off-duty hours, Rand said Friday in a telephone briefing with reporters.
Rand declined to specify the nature of the “illegal drug activity.” The Associated Press reported that the airman were accused of using cocaine.
The misconduct comes after repeated efforts to improve the morale among the land-based ICBM force. That followed a spate of scandals in 2014 when dozens of nuclear launch officers who operate the ICBMs were disciplined earlier this year for misconduct that included drug use and cheating.
The misconduct highlighted how the ICBM force at large was suffering from low morale, disciplinary problems, lack of resources, training lapses and leadership failures. Many officials attributed that to its lack of prestige and a mission that felt like a low priority in the post-Cold-War era.
In 2014, the Pentagon approved new, generous bonuses for the nuclear force, including security personnel, of up to $300 a month, making them among the highest paid across the military.
In a broader effort to improve morale, the Air Force also provided the nuclear force officers with new vehicles, deep-cleaned their launch control facilities, and adjusted their schedules to improve their quality of life.
In 2014, an investigation into drug use at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montanta mushroomed into a wider scandal involving widespread cheating on proficiency tests.
That investigation ultimately target about 100 officers accused of cheating. Among them, 79 officers were disciplined, including 15 who faced involuntary discharge procedures.
In January 2015, Air Force 2nd Lt. Nicole Dalmazzi was sentenced to one month confinement after pleading guilty using ecstasy.
A missileer with the 12th Missile Squadron at Malmstrom, Dalmazzi was initially accused of obstruction of justice but that charged was dropped as part of her plea deal.
Rand on Friday would not comment on how this new drug investigation reflects upon the command’s broader problems in recent years.
“I would like for the purposes of today to keep those cases separate,” Rand said when asked about the investigations in 2014.
“We have been in an on-going force improvement program for the past two years to address some very important issues that existed across the command. I am not going to tie these two together,” he said.
Rand said he has not called for any new drug tests for his nuclear force.“I will wait for the investigation to give me more facts surrounding this circumstance before I go down the road of doing a command wide urinalysis,” Rand said.
The leadership of the ICBM community has also come under scrutiny recently. The prior commander of 20th Air Force, Lt. Gen. Jack Weinstein, was accused of fostering a “hostile work environment” but an inspector general’s probe later cleared him of any wrong doing. Weinstein was promoted last year to a top Pentagon job with the nuclear force as the Air Force’s deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration.
The nuclear force was a top concern for former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has paid special attention to the nuclear force during his two-year tenure.
The high-level advocacy for the nuclear mission reflects concerns that morale was suffering and the Air Force was not drawing the best and brightest into the nuclear-related career fields because those jobs lack prestige and offer limited opportunities for promotion.
Once considered among the top jobs in the military, the nuclear force was marginalized to some extent during the past couple of decades.
After the Cold War ended, the sense of urgency about the nuclear missions faded. And in the post-9/11 era of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Air Force focused on shorter-range tactical aircraft that could provide close-air support for ground troops.",1
"We all know the music industry isn't quite the nest of golden eggs it once was. So who can blame artists if they try to diversify their portfolio a little? One step beyond the merch stand, there are the traditional sideshows of the perfume brand, the clothing range, the restaurant, and increasingly, the hot sauce/high-end spirit.

"On Thursday, December 1 2016 a vital Supreme Court order is set to go into effect that dramatically expands the surveillance power of federal agents. The impending alteration to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure softens the legal requirements for obtaining search and seizure warrants that grant the government remote access to individual’s computers and phones.
In the past, law enforcement was required to obtain a warrant from a judge within the jurisdiction where the proposed search was going take place. Under this new system, however, if an individual is using technology to conceal their location, the warrant is considered valid regardless of jurisdiction. A single authorization will have the potential to validate millions of searches on private devices. Any journalist, activist, or whistleblower who values privacy and uses tools like Freenet or the Tor network will fall directly into the crosshairs.
As USA Today summarized, the rule change was “sought by the Justice Department, adopted by the U. S. Federal Courts, and approved on April 28 by the Supreme Court without much fanfare.”
These changes have been on the fast track since the FBI had evidence thrown out in a recent child pornography case. The defendant was using the Tor network to conceal his IP address and operating a child pornography site known as Playpen. The Department of Justice and FBI refused to disclose the legal process used to gain access to the evidence, likely because they did not follow proper legal protocols. As a result,at least some of their evidence was rejected by the court.
The controversy was compounded by the FBI’s use of Playpen’s servers to set up a massive sting, known as Operation Pacifier. The pedophilic porn site was run directly by federal agents for over two weeks in an attempt to round up any individuals using the network. These same agencies are now claiming that without changes to the current rule, their ability to put the scum of society behind bars is severely restricted.
The dark web has been subverting the controllable marketplace for years, but through the eyes of the government, anything outside of their dominance is equivalent to insurrection. Without a doubt, anonymity online creates adouble-edged sword of freedom versus lawlessness, so it’s no surprise significant action has been taken to crack down on this space under the guise of national security and public safety.
In this vein, the modification of Rule 41 has been framed as crucial in preventing crime even though implementing it grants sweeping authority to the State.
Typically, any changes that carry these broad implications are openly debated in Congress, but by classifying the move as a simple procedural change, the discussion was instead held by the small U. S. Courts Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure following the Department of Justice’s request to modify the rule. The alteration was approved by the Supreme Court. The lack of publicity received for something so fundamental shows there has been a deliberate effort to conceal the consequences of this scheme.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been an outspoken advocate for maintaining the current protections. The organization has voiced itsconcernsabout the new rule:
“The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure set the ground rules for federal criminal prosecutions. The rules cover everything from correcting clerical errors in a judgment to which holidays a court will be closed on—all the day-to-day procedural details that come with running a judicial system. The key word here is ‘procedural.’ By law, the rules and proposals are supposed to be procedural and must not change substantive rights. But the amendment to Rule 41 isn’t procedural at all. It creates new avenues for government hacking that were never approved by Congress.”
The media has done an excellent job of demonizing the dark web and the anonymous networks that inhabit it. By focusing on stories like the Silk Roadand its founder Ross Ulbricht (among others who use anonymous systems to conceal state-designated criminal activity), the media has convinced the public that anonymity and criminality are one and the same. The federal government has long held this belief; during a crackdown in 2014, the FBI targeted more than 400 Tor addresses in an attempt to identify the actual locations of anonymous servers.
Maintaining complete privacy doesn’t matter to those whose biggest worry is having their porn history made public. But it’s the underground railroad for renegades working against the establishment. Journalists who are communicating with sources or establishing an outlet for whistleblowers need a layer of protection that can encourage others to feel safe coming forward. As activism and social media continue to merge, it’s essential that the leadership of dissenting movements can coordinate action without having to worry about infiltration.
There have been multiple bipartisan actions to curtail this erosion of privacy, namely through the Stopping Mass Hacking Act and the Review the Rule Act. Well-known lawmakers who value individual liberty, like Thomas Massie andRand Paul, have come out in full support of these counter-efforts. Twenty-three members of Congress also sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch to express concerns and ask for more information.
Senator Ron Wyden, a member of the Senate’s Intelligence Committee, is a sponsor of the Stopping Mass Hacking Act. In a last ditch effort, he called onCongress to take action in an attempt to block the rule change. Unfortunately, the motion was voted down on Wednesday morning.
“If Congress doesn’t stop these changes, a single judge will be able to grant a warrant to hack a million (or more) computers and other devices. By hacking the devices of victims of a botnet, the government will be treating victims the same way it treats attackers. We need to pass my Stopping Mass Hacking (SMH) Act right now.”
Removing these kinds of limitations on power is what, over time, leads to the complete subjugation of a society. This takes a huge step towards further neutering the 4th Amendment of the Bill of Rights, making probable cause on an individual basis a thing of the past. The desire for privacy cannot be considered suspicious in a world where almost all personal information is a matter of public record.
This ruling can easily be rationalized when framed as an effort to stop child trafficking, but the unseen effects it will have on the future of journalism and activism must be seriously examined. Contacting legislators directly may seem futile, but making their lives difficult is one of the best ways to get their attention. If those of us who are passionate about preserving individual freedom become apathetic, there will be nobody left to hold back the constant progression of invasive statism.",1
"Recent findings from researchers of the University at Buffalo discovered concentrations of antidepressants meant for humans in 10 different kinds of fish in the Niagara River. That is the river that links Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.
Active ingredients in Zoloft, Prozac and other antidepressants had built up“in the brains of smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, rudd, rock bass, white bass, white perch, walleye, bowfin, steelhead and yellow perch,” reports NY Daily News.
The source of their unwitting druggings?
Diana Aga, Ph. D, a professor at the University at Buffalo,stated:
These active ingredients from antidepressants, which are coming out from wastewater treatment plants, are accumulating in fish brains…
It is a threat to biodiversity, and we should be very concerned.
She is concerned that it will affect fish behavior noting that other studies have shown changes in feeding behavior of fish or their survival instinct. Scientists are claiming that these amounts don’t pose a threat to humans who eat them but they also admit that they need to do more research to know “what amount” will affect humans.
I’ve written about the problems of repurposing wastewater before. Because it’s not just run0ff from the treatment plants – the water is then repurposed for agriculture. While this practice may earn some companies brownie points for not using up fresh water – it is actually anything but environmentally friendly. When used on crops, toxicants can uptake in to the plants. Indeed, those of us eating the produce can be dosed with bipolar drugs and more. As I’ve said, this is the reason to buy organic, sad it as it may be.
Treatment plants are simply not keeping up with socio-cultural changes such as the proliferation of prescription drug use and its presence in human waste. I’m not just saying drug use is exploding because the media says so – between the years of1999-2002 and 2011-14 the use of antidepressants rose 65 percent (National Center for Health Statistics).It isn’t getting filtered out.
While the media is bemused with their jokes of fish who need “happy pills” it’s really disconcerting if you think about it. Both for you, for the fish, the environment and the future of our ecology.
If you or anyone you know is considering an antidepressant, please first go to SSRIstories.com. Antidepressants can lead to suicidal/homicidal thoughts and actions. While it’s a person’s choice to take them, the drugs should stay far out of the public arena. But sadly, wastewater is a main reason that animals and humans can be dosed with drugs without their knowledge, right through their food.
Something needs to change to keep people from being drugged without their knowledge which violates informed consent, especially given the dangerous side effects of antidepressants. In the mean time, eating lower on the food chain and choosing organic are a couple of ways to avoid consuming antidepressant and bipolar medicine run-off.

"If you’ve got a sweet tooth, then pie may be your go-to treat that always cures the craving. Cream pies, such as coconut and banana tend to be the most well-known when it comes to the legendary sweet treat. But, there is another sweet cream pie that is just as good, if not better. And it may solve those sugar cravings at a faster rate. The sugar cream pie is true to its name and contains that classic flaky crust, sugary sweetness and a blended cream that will melt in your mouth bite after bite. The top of the pie has a crispy layer that adds to the bustling flavor. And it’s an appropriate dessert for all year long, whether you are attending a Thanksgiving dinner or a 4th of July BBQ.
Another great thing about this recipe is that the majority of the ingredients may already be sitting in your kitchen, just waiting to be used. You’ll need the following to execute this sweet treat that will be loved by the whole family:
1 cup sugar
1 pie shell (either store-bought or homemade)
1 cup half-and-half
2 cups heavy cream
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 egg yolks
2 tablespoons unsalted melted butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Now, it’s time to put the ingredients together and make some magic that will melt in your mouth…
While your oven is preheating to 350 degrees, you’ll place the pie dough or pre-made pie crust in a standard round pie dish.
Whisk together flour, sugar, salt and nutmeg in a large bowl. Remember, nutmeg is optional and simply adds some extra flavor.
Once those ingredients are well-blended, you’ll add the heavy cream and mix together
Take out a medium sized bowl and use your whisk to blend the egg yolks, half-and-half, and vanilla extract. Once this separate mixture is blended together thoroughly you will combine this with the heavy cream mixture. Stir the two separate combinations together, blending them all into one massive mixture.
Now it’s time to pour your final mixture into the pie crust. If you’re using a homemade pie crust, crimp the edges after you pour the mixture in. Use a brush to layer the melted butter on the pie crust.
Your final touch will be to sprinkle some cinnamon on the top of the pie, before you put it in the oven.
Set your timer for 60 or 70 minutes. When it’s time to check your pie, you’ll want to make sure that the center of the pie is set but slightly jiggly when shaken. The filling will start to boil slightly right after it hits an hour of baking time. Allow ten minutes for it to bubble, before removing it from the oven. This added time will give it that crispy layer, adding to the texture.
The final step is the hardest because it calls for a bit of patience. After you remove the pie from the oven, you’ll need to let it cool completely before you can enjoy it. Trust us…it’s worth the wait.
Enjoy your newly made sugar cream pie!",1
"Come New Years Day, most people kick into high gear, choose a new diet plan, pay for a gym membership, and do their best to transform their body. And most people, despite their best intentions, will struggle through the winter to lose the weight and keep it off.
What they don’t know is that winter weight loss requires a very different set of foods and behaviors than dieting in warmer months.
The best kept secret about proper winter weight loss?
You can cleanse your organs, boost your energy, and drop the weight in a holistic, natural way that reconnects you to your best guide: your body.
Most cleanses, diets, and detox plans focus on freshly pressed vegetable juices, fruits, salads, and raw foods that are actually too cooling for the body in cold winter months.
The human body has evolved with the seasons to eat heavily in the fall harvest season and keep weight on the winter to protect from the cold and lack of food. If you’ve tried a juice cleanse in the winter before, you’ll know what I mean.
We naturally crave warming soups, cooked foods, and the fats to protect our organs and skin from biting winds, freezing temperature, and less sunlight. A well-planned winter weight loss cleanse will help you feel strong and warm, and help you drop the extra pounds without leaving your frail and cold.
Here are my tops tips for cleansing in winter:
When you’re physically cold, what sounds better: a chilled salad or a bowl of soup? See, you actually know your body better than you may think. Focus on the seasonal, local foods that grow near your home. For most of us, that means eating more naturally sweet, dense root vegetables, hearty winter greens, and quality animal products. Warming spices and herbs may also be used to ground and sustain your energy. Try my Warming Winter Cleanse Broth recipe below.
Did you know your body needs the right kind of fats to help absorb important nutrients from food as well as lose weight? True story. Healthy fats help your body soak up vitamins A, D and E, and are necessary for a healthy nervous system. That also means when you eat the right fats, your mood is better.
Stock up on a variety of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and the right saturated fats this winter, but avoid hydrogenated and trans fats that lurk in processed foods. Try olives, olive oil, almonds, avocados, salmon, walnuts, anchovies, flax seeds, hemp seeds, grass-fed butter, organic clarified butter, and unrefined coconut oil.
In fact, studies show that eating two tablespoons of unrefined coconut oil, rich in medium-chain-fatty-acids, with meals can boost body temperature and metabolism, helping to avoid the metabolic slow-down associated with winter dieting.
Refined sugars and carbohydrates cause most obesity and heart disease, not fat. But we still crave sweet! This winter, eat a variety of naturally sweet, high-nutrient, seasonal vegetables to give you the sweet taste, satisfaction, and grounded, cozy energy you desire. Roast beets, bake sweet potatoes, and steam winter pumpkins and squash for their vitamins and mild natural sweetness, and it will be much easier to mute sugar’s siren call.
When the weather is cold, and the day is short, human bodies return to the natural, evolved state of slow metabolism and more sleep. Get more sleep during the early, dark evening hours, and wake up earlier to catch every ray of sunlight possible. When you wake up early and get more morning sunlight, it has a positive effect on your sleep cycle. More sleep before midnight, especially in winter, helps your mood stay stable, stops you from midnight snacking, and improves the quality of your sleep.
Here is one of my best, mineral- and nutrient-rich, warming broths that you’ll love this winter.
* One large bunch of kale or bok choy, roughly chopped
1. Combine all in a large pot and cover with enough cold, filtered water to cover.
2. Bring to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer with the lid on for one hour.
3. Turn off the heat, give your broth time to cool to a point where you can comfortably handle it, then strain through a fine meshed strainer. You can use a large spoon or spatula to squeeze liquid and nutrients out of soft veggies.
4. Be sure not to transfer hot broth to a glass container, but this broth can be refrigerated for a week in sealed glass jars.",1

"Toddlers learn many new words and begin to form simple sentences. The number of words in a toddler’s vocabulary expands rapidly. By 2 years of age, children typically begin to connect words, such as “go” and “bye, bye” to make the simple sentence “Go bye-bye.” By 3 years, many toddlers are able to form a variety of sentences with three or four words.
Young toddlers both babble and use real words. Parents and caregivers will be able to understand a toddler some of the time, but they may have difficulty understanding the child on other occasions. People outside the toddler’s family may also have difficulty understanding all of his words.
Toddlers can use language to imitate and to talk about pretend things and past experiences. As your toddler engages in pretend play, she thinks out loud and talks to herself. She also develops an ability to talk about past experiences in one or two sentences. This is important because it is the beginning of your child’s understanding and production of stories.
Not all toddlers develop language in the same way or at the same rate. For example, some children tend to develop language in spurts, while others show more slow, steady growth. Not all children learn to talk in the same way. Some learn to speak by learning words one by one. Others pay less attention to individual words, but learn to speak in phrases, saying, “Gimme cup of juice,” for example.
Toddlers are developing an awareness of the power of words. At this age, your toddler is learning that he can use words to get attention, get his needs met, and express his feelings.
Encouraging Your Toddler
Pretend with your toddler. Help your child move beyond the “here and now” in her play with toys. Help create worlds with words as you play together. For example, if your toddler says “Truck up!” you might reply “That truck is going way up to the moon!”.
Help your toddler tell a story about a special event. To support your toddler’s emerging storytelling abilities, you might pose questions such as, “And what was on top of your birthday cake?” or elaborate on what your child says. For example, if your toddler says, “Big doggie!” you might say, “Yes, Bruno was a very big doggie, wasn’t he?” Supporting your child’s ability to tell stories helps develop her language skills as well as her appreciation of stories.
Talk about family photos. Talking with your toddler about photographs of family events is a great source for stories and will stimulate not only his memory, but his language as well. Constructing photo albums or homemade books about a particular event, such as a child’s birthday, is a wonderful way of being able to revisit special events over and over again.
Give your child words for feelings. This is a great time to introduce specific words that map onto specific feelings. When your child is frustrated, you can introduce words such as “mad”, “angry”, and “frustrated”. You can also offer your child specific phrases he can use to get your help and attention.",0
"Eyebrow ""embroidery"" – or microblading – is a process of adding semi-permanent ink to the eyebrows using tiny incisions to mimic eyebrow hairs, giving brows a fuller appearance.
The technique is popular among some celebrities, including actress Bella Thorne, who documented her transformation on Snapchat this summer.
Julia Milin of Brow Design International says the process is in high demand.
“It's caught fire already but now it's really starting to get huge,” Milin said.
According to Milin, the process starts with sketching the brows with a pencil, then application of a topical numbing agent before beginning the microblading process, which involves making tiny scratches on the surface of the skin, then injecting a temporary dye that fades over time. The dye lasts between 1 and 3 years.
Piret Aava, a Manhattan aesthetician who calls herself the Eyebrow Doctor, has worked in the eyebrow business for almost 12 years.
She says that the beauty about eyebrow embroidery is that it doesn’t last forever.
“If you get tired of the shape and want to change it, you’re not stuck with it,” Aava said. “It looks a lot more natural and less scary than the old-school eyebrow tattoo.”
But doctors warn that if it isn’t done properly it could make brows look much worse.
“Anytime you create a break in the skin you take some risk. The obvious risks are things like infection and scarring,” Dr. Doris Day, a dermatologist, told ABC News.
The procedure costs between $500 and $1,500. For some, like Paulina Baltazar, the cost is worth it.
Baltazar had the procedure done and said it came out “amazing,” adding: “My mornings are going to be a lot quicker so I’m happy about that.”
For more affordable alternatives to microblading, Michelle Lee, the editor-in-chief of Allure, offered the following tips:
1. Never pluck grays. That can sabotage the shape of your brows. Instead, cover grays with tinted brow gel or get them professionally dyed.
2. Resist the urge to tweeze. Nine times out of ten, all you need to do is trim. Comb your brows straight up with a spooley brush, then lightly snip only the longest hairs with eyebrow scissors.
3. Add highlights. Brighten up your brows the same way you highlight your hair by taking a contrasting cream shadow (like a soft gold) and tracing it over the brow with a soft shadow brush. Always comb through with a clean spooley brush.
4. Fake a higher arch. If you highlight right above the arch (in addition to below), it gives the illusion of raised brows (think Karlie Kloss). Use a highlighter or cream eye shadow that's one shade lighter than your foundation to draw an arch directly above your arch. Blend with your finger until the product fades but doesn't disappear.
5. Blend with two shades: To make brows look longer, use a pencil or powder slightly lighter than your hair color on the inside corners and one the same color as your hair through the arch and end. Most brow powders come in duos -- one light shade, one dark -- for this reason.",0

"Q: Is there such a thing as a TV Guide for programs, movies and shows that are streaming online? I want a real simple way to see what’s available on Amazon vs. Apple vs. Hulu vs. YouTube vs. Roku and all the others!
A: There are so many different streaming services available, and each provides a different blend of programming. As you’ve pointed out, it’s hard to tell what flicks and shows are available on each service, especially when titles appear and vanish so unpredictably. You’ll be happy to hear that several different sites have answered the call and can summarize these streaming catalogs at a glance. Click here for easy-to-follow guides to streaming content.
Q: The dialogue on my TV is awful. I can hardly hear people, but the sounds are loud. How can I fix this?
A: When you bring a new TV into your home, it arrives with a lot of arbitrary settings: tint, color, contrast and so on. The volume controls are nearly as important as the picture, because they can dramatically affect the sound of the dialogue, ambient noise and music. There are many ways to fix this problem, but if you’re not accustomed to working with speakers and acoustics, you’ll need a little guidance. Click here to learn about a hidden volume setting.
Q: I was thinking about getting a smart thermostat to save money on heating bills. Is the Nest or Ecobee the better choice?
A: Most of our monthly energy bills relate to the heating and cooling of our homes, and the smarter your thermostat is, the less energy you’ll use. The exciting part of both systems is that they will automatically adapt to your household’s needs.

How to become a better essay/article/review writer
Anyone can write an essay and in a sense, it is their way of expressing their great ideas, however, for a lot, to be able to write an incredibly amazing essay would take years of practice. How exactly do you go about in becoming a better essay writer? You may rely on writing services, that make a perfect custom English essay for you, but also you may read this article.
The following are ten tips in order to become better essay writers:
Thesis development.
As an essay writer, the point in providing a thesis is to prove it.
This usually consists of one or two sentences in the introduction and this explains what the topic at hand is and this will be evaluated by the instructor based on how the essay/paragraphs will relate to this statement.
All other paragraphs to be made should solely revolve around this central idea. There should be no paragraphs which should drift off topic. Always stick to the point.
The thesis statement should be able to explain the topic or the inquiry you wish to answer in a brief and concise manner. In short, do not make it wordy.
The student should introduce the thesis statement clearly. Likewise with making it brief and short, it should also make some sort of path which will enable subsequent paragraphs explain and answer the subject matter.
It is a must take note of the following paragraphs whether the explanation and example in the body of the essay support the thesis statement.
In-line with the above, the writer must take the initiative to check if the conclusion is able to prove the thesis.
Avoid repetition.
It is very difficult to write an essay, given that even if it just writing a three paged essay. An essential way of doing this for some is to be repetitive, however, repeating the same ideas and even words, it is indicative of laziness.
Eliminate or remove ALL repetitive words or phrases in the essay.
Instead of repeating the same idea all over again, be keen in using other forms of the word such as anything synonymous to it and use pronouns as the student sees fit. It is highly advisable to use a thesaurus at this stage.
Use the active voice.
This means that the sentences should have the actors or the subject perform the action: “Bhea ate an apple.” Instead of “An apple was eaten by Bhea”.
Read others’ essays.
Reading other people’s essays would give an insight on one’s writing style as well as others and in doing so, it will enable a writer to develop and build their own essay writing style.
Reading other essays would also enable an author to critically judge and know how an essay should be written in a sense that once they apply it to their own work, they would be able to know what should go in it and what should not.
Improving vocabulary and its proper usage.
In-line with the second tip, being able to have a wide range of stocked words will enable the writer to avoid repetition and this is shown in the writing of the essay wherein the audience will also feel not only the creativeness but also the intelligence and wittiness should they read the paper.
Use the right
The most appropriate sources vary from subject to subject and the following are common ones used by academic learners all over the globe:
Academic articles – are scholarly articles written at universities and are usually published as journals or as books.
Newspaper articles – can be used as evidence in writing, especially those which needs to date back an event from the past.
The essay should be written in a logical order.
This means that the introduction should flow naturally to the body and to the conclusion. They must also be correlated with each other.
The essay should have a good format and is easy to follow.
In order to this, the writer should produce an outline before the paper is written in order for them to have a guide to follow.
An effective writing style.
Everyone has their own writing style used, regardless should it be influenced by other people’s essays. In-line with this, their writing style should be able to produce sentences of various types, phrases which has idioms, have insight of genre-specific vocabulary, and effective punctuation whilst in writing the mentioned.
Running a spell check, essentially speaking, edit and proof read.
Needless to say, writing an essay should be followed up with effective editing so run a spell check and pay heed to suggested replacement. Brilliant essays have little to no error.
Ask for a second opinion.
This is in-line with the ninth opinion. It is always best to ask someone to read your essay before handing it in to the instructor. This will enable them to know if their essay is not only good in form and style but also relatable and easy to understand, especially for those who do not specialize i

"A commercial effort to get humans into orbit around Mars in the late 2020s now includes a sleek vehicle to send astronauts down to the surface of the Red Planet.
The aerospace company Lockheed Martin late Thursday (Sept. 28) revealed new details for its Mars Base Camp plan, an architecture aimed at building a crewed space station in orbit around the Red Planet that would support long-term exploration at Mars by astronauts on 1,000-day missions . Among the updates unveiled was a tantalizing design for a reusable, single-stage surface lander called the Mars Ascent/Descent Vehicle (MADV). [In Pictures: Lockheed Martin's Mars Base Camp Plan]
The MADV would attach to the space station, and travel to and from the Martian surface via supersonic retropropulsion, which uses rocket engines to slow the lander from supersonic speeds during its descent, according to three Lockheed Martin engineers who discussed the lander in a presentation at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Adelaide, Australia. Supersonic retropropulsion is the same approach used by SpaceX in to land its reusable Falcon 9 rocket boosters.
The initial crewed missions to the Martian surface would be ""relatively short-duration, science-focused missions,"" according to a newly-released report from the company (which you can read and download here). Eventually, the reusable lander would allow up to four astronauts to take two-week missions to the ground. The report suggests sending two landers, mostly for redundancy purposes to ensure astronauts don't get stuck on the surface of the planet.
The lander would refuel on the space station, and would utilize liquid hydrogen fuel, which would come from water molecules broken into their composite oxygen and hydrogen atoms. (This requires energy that would be supplied by the solar panels on the station.)
The use of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propellant is an integral part of the entire Mars Base Camp (MBC) architecture, the company representatives said. While that water could initially come from Earth, it could later come from water ice frozen on asteroids, in shadowed regions of the moon's surface, from possible sources on Mars' two moons, or from Mars itself. The water would be delivered to the station by a Water Delivery Vehicles (WDVs), which could be operated by a separate commercial entity, the Lockheed Martin engineers said.
The crew quarters on the lander would be designed after NASA's Orion human crew capsule for deep-space exploration, which is still in development, but which NASA plans to use in its pursuit of a human Mars mission. Lockheed Martin is NASA's prime contractor for Orion.
Lockheed Martin is developing its Mars habitat design as part of NASA's Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program. The company received $982,039 in funding from the first round of the program.
The MBC also relies on the use of NASA's Deep Space Gateway at the moon, which is likely to be a small orbiting space station. This would serve as a waystation or in-space launching point for crewed missions on the way to Mars.
The MBC architecture would also use of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, currently in development, to get astronauts and components to Mars, the company has said. The MBC space station would consist of multiple separate components, some of which would be launched straight from Earth, while others might undergo some construction in cislunar space.
Mars Base Camp is named after the base camps set up for climbing expeditions to the tops of mountains like Everest. In this case, the ""peak"" is down on the surface, and the base camp is in orbit, and would serve a similar purpose to those mountain camps: a place for humans to prepare before making their way to the surface of the Red Planet.
""Base camps are not a destination unto themselves,"" said Rob Chambers, one of the Lockheed engineers who spoke at the conference. ""They're a place from which you then set out — in this case, to descend to the surfaces of other worlds.""

Low Dose Naltrexone has been used since the 1980s for over 200 diseases including Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s, Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Crohn’s disease, HIV/AIDS, and a wide variety of cancers. Yet, most doctors still don’t know about LDN since it is inexpensive and not promoted by drug companies. Low Dose Naltrexone works by strengthening the immune system and is non-toxic.
Dr. Joseph Mercola says in Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN): One of the RARE Drugs that Actually Helps Your Body to Heal Itself: “It is not often that I advocate the use of prescription drugs, but low-dose naltrexone (LDN) is one of those rare exceptions that may hold the promise of helping millions of people with cancer and autoimmune disease. As a pharmacologically active opioid antagonist, LDN works by blocking opioid receptors, which in turn helps activate your body’s immune system.“
Dr. David Gluck explains inLow Dose Naltrexone: a very promising drug for treating cancer and 200+ other diseases: “LDN is absolutely unique. And that’s part of its problem, in that it’s a brand new paradigm, a new way of thinking of treatment. Instead of the medication actually doing the work, LDN goes into the body and essentially tricks the body by forcing it to double and triple its output of endorphins and metenkephalin, also known as opioid growth factor (OGF). Those endorphins and metenkephalin, in turn, cause the immune system to strengthen. A nice way to think about LDN is that it is not like any other medication whatsoever. It is a way to strengthen the immune system.”
Dr. Gluck points out inMy experience with Low Dose Naltrexone: “LDN has been especially popular for a great number of people who suffer from MS because it is beneficial in a high percentage of patients and it is the antithesis of the spectrum of “approved” anti-MS medications, which are questionably effective, often painful and problematic to use, are sometimes dangerous, and are always expensive. LDN, in contrast, is almost always effective, easy to use, non-toxic, easily affordable and it has virtually no significant side effects.”
Julia Schopick, author of Honest Medicine: Effective, Time-Tested, Inexpensive Treatments for Life-Threatening Diseases, says in the article Most Doctors Don’t Know About Low Dose Naltrexone for Autoimmune Diseases: “LDN is a very low dose of a drug, naltrexone, that was approved by the FDA in the mid-1980s for drug addiction, and a few years later, for alcohol addiction. At around the same time, a brilliant, Harvard-educated physician named Dr. Bernard Bihari discovered that, in very LOW doses, which he called LOW Dose Naltrexone, it raised endorphin levels and caused the immune system to act correctly. He said that LDN “modulates” or “orchestrates” the immune system.”
Schopick points out: “One in five Americans has an autoimmune disease. The prevalence and incidence of autoimmune diseases is on the rise. Low-Dose Naltrexoneis a little-known butpromising treatment that autoimmune disease patients need to know about.…LDN is extremely inexpensive especially when compared to many of the treatments doctors routinely prescribed for autoimmune diseases. For this reason, I believe that LDN could literally save healthcare. This is not a claim that I make lightly, and it’s one I fervently believe.”
Schopick adds: “Most conventional doctorsdo not know about Low Dose Naltrexone for autoimmune diseases….Luckily, tens of thousands of patients have found it for themselves and are advocating for it all over the world. Thanks to LDN patient advocates, it is relatively easy for patients to find doctors who will prescribe it and compounding pharmacists who compound it correctly.”
David Borenstein, MD prescribes LDN in NYC. In the one-hour audio interview linked to on his site, Dr. Borenstein stresses that an anti-inflammatory diet and healing the gut are key in treating auto-immune diseases with LDN – especially rheumatoid arthritis. He recommends stopping LDN at least a week before having a minor medical procedure that requires anesthesia and waiting at least 5 days after the last narcotic before re-starting LDN.
The 2016 video LDN & Cancer – THE GAME CHANGER interviews six doctors in various countries about their use of LDN for cancer as well as three patients and a pharmacist. Dr. Akbar Khan in Canada and the pharmacist recommend using high doses of Vitamin D with LDN — 5,000-10,000 units per day (in liquid form) or even 15,000-20,000. The pharmacist also recommends medical hemp.
There is a great deal of information available on LDN online. The LDN Story (A documentary about low dose naltrexone) interviews parents who had great success using LDN for their autistic son and a woman for whom LDN was the only thing that brought relief for her Fibromyalgia. The LDN Fact Sheet 2016 explains that LDN is available as liquid, sub-lingual drops, capsules, and a cream.
Dr. Joseph Mercola explains in his article Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN): One of the RARE Drugs that Actually Helps Your Body to Heal Itself:
“In 1985, Dr. Bernard Bihari discovered LDN enhanced patients’ response to infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Years later, he found that his patients with cancer and autoimmune disease also benefited from LDN. Dr. Bihari has reportedly treated more than 450 cancer patients with LDN with promising results, including cancers of the bladder, breast, liver, lung, lymph nodes, colon, and rectum. According to Dr. Bihari, nearly a quarter of his patients had at least a 75 percent reduction in tumor size, and nearly 60 percent of his patients demonstrated disease stability.”
“Says Dr. Burton M. Berkson, MD, who has attested to achieving phenomenal results with low-dose naltrexone in both cancer patients and those with autoimmune diseases: ‘It is difficult for many to believe that one drug can accomplish so many tasks. But LDN does not treat symptoms as most drugs do. It actually works way “upstream” to modulate the basic mechanisms that result in the disease state.’”
Low Dose Naltrexone must be prescribed. However, doctors who are not familiar with LDN may be reluctant to prescribe it for off label uses since the FDA approved LDN only for drug and alcohol addiction. Some MDs may dismiss success in using LDN for other illnesses as “anecdotal” because they are not backed by (expensive) placebo-controlled, double-blind studies which are the gold standard of medicine. Since LDN is now a generic drug, there is no incentive for drug companies to invest millions of dollars in studies to get FDA approval for other uses of LDN.
However, in Honest Medicine: Effective, Time-Tested, Inexpensive Treatments for Life-Threatening Diseases, Julia Schopick introduces the concept of “Patient-Evidence-Based Treatments”. Schopick demonstrates why these remedies must now be taken seriously. David Brownstein, MD says: “Honest Medicine should be required reading for all physicians and patients searching for safe and effective therapies.”
For patients whose doctors are not familiar with LDN and may be unwilling to prescribe it, the site at: https://www.ldnscience.org/patients/find-a-doctor lists doctors who prescribe LDN in over 20 countries.
In the LDN Coaching section of her Honest Medicine site, Schopick offers help in convincing your doctor to prescribe this medicine for you. LDN is not available from local pharmacies and must be purchased from a compounding pharmacy. Several are available, but the most recommended is Skip’s Pharmacy which will ship the pills to you in the dosage you request.
Skip’s Pharmacy links to the Mary Boyle Bradley site: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/mary-boyle-bradley which provides a wealth of information on LDN.
In the article Low Dose Naltrexone and chronic pain, Dr. Pradeep Chopra points out: “Naltrexone is manufactured as 50mg pills. Compounding pharmacies can prepare Low Dose Naltrexone to any dose specified. Because of differences in compounding pharmacies and the fillers, it’s suggested that patients use a compounding pharmacy that has experience with LDN. The pharmacy must produce LDN in an instant release formulation and not as timed release or slow release. The LDN must not be released in to the body slowly.
Compounding pharmacies can prepare the drug as capsules, tablets, liquid or topical cream. In preparing LDN, pharmacies can change the inactive ingredients (fillers) especially if a reaction is suspected. They can also make it in a gluten-free filler. For ultra low doses of naltrexone, it is prepared as a liquid suspension.The dose recommended by Dr. Bihari was 1.5mg to 4.5 mg taken at bedtime. However studies show that taking LDN at night is not necessary. If side effects occur then lowering the dose is recommended, or taking it in the morning in case of insomnia.”
LDN for Parkinson’s Disease: Low Dose Naltrexonerecommends the $12 DVD of the presentation by Lexie Washington (aka Marlene Lindstrom) onLDN for Parkinson’s. The DVD is called Heal Your Immune System: Heal Your Parkinson’s Disease” Low Dose Naltrexone – “a Modern Wonder Drug?”. Marlene has gotten off all her Parkinson’s medications except one and has no signs of Parkinson’s now. The DVD includes not only Marlene’s testimonial but that of another Parkinson’s patient who has had great success using LDN. Marlene warns that anyone who is using LDN MUST also wear a “No Opiates” bracelet because LDN blocks opiate pain medicine.
Dr. Chopra explains the article Low Dose Naltrexone and chronic pain: “LDN can be taken with other medications or supplements as long as they do not contain opiates or synthetic narcotics, examples of which include fentanyl, meperidine (Demerol, Pethidine), tramadol, morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone. Naltrexone blocks the opioid receptors. Therefore pain medications will be blocked from working and could lead to withdrawal problems. Check with your doctor and pharmacist to make sure that none of your medications are contraindicated. They can also advise you on stopping pain medications that might interfere with LDN and offer advice and amount of time to allow between stopping opiates and starting LDN.
After starting LDN, if you have surgery scheduled or a procedure that may require pain medications, consult with your doctor to determine the amount of time needed to clear again from your system so that it does not interfere with anesthesia or pain medications. LDN must also be stopped if your doctor plans to prescribe opiate-based medications for postoperative use. The time required to clear naltrexone for the body may vary, based on dosage and body weight. After a procedure under anesthesia or requiring pain medications allow adequate time for the opiates to clear from your system before restarting LDN.”
If an LDN user is taken to a hospital in an emergency, the “No Opiates” bracelet will help alert the hospital staff not to give opiate pain killers. The bracelet is available from Etsy for about $4.

"When you decide that you want to use visual art to aid in finishing off your interior spaces, you have a choice of many different mediums and textures. Traditional prints can be created on stock board or thick vellum paper. There are also traditional Fine Art America canvas prints which look different than what you see typically listed for sale as the texture of the canvas truly comes through. This is because canvas provides a porously textured medium in which pigments are printed and layered onto. No matter which one you get, no two canvases will ever be totally alike. So, when you have a choice of painting prints to bring into your home, seek out canvas if you are looking for originality.
The most outwardly mundane image can become larger than life when it is produced on an oversized scale. Sometimes referred to as ‘sofa art,’ these pieces are generally several feet high and many feet wide. You might need some assistance even just getting them hung up and centered on your walls as these cumbersome prints are truly epic in size. While standing just in front of them, you will have to turn your head back and forth to take in all of the details. While looking from a distance, the real intention of the artist will become apparent as oversized printed canvases have lots of unique details to look at and ponder.
Oil is one of the most versatile paint mediums on the planet, and as such, replicating them accurately takes a lot of skill. Original oil paintings take as much as a week to dry completely as the thick layers of paint require just the right amount of air flow to get to all of the crevices. Traditional Fine Art America canvas prints that replicate images made with oil paint are much more tedious to create than original artworks made with watercolor or gauche.
Many artists complete the last brush stroke on their paintings and vow that their work is done. Others will shellac, treat, coat and add varnish to their completed images, in an effort to create a picture perfect finish. Paintings can have a high shine finish that adds a surreal feeling, or use tinted hues to create various moods. You may not know what type of finish you want the canvas paintings in your home to have, so it is perfectly fine to browse different types of paintings until you are familiar with the most popular types.
You can put up a series of canvas prints that tell a sequential story, or just choose one great, big painting that takes up nearly an entire wall. There’s no right or wrong answer when it comes to personally selecting the kind of art you want in your home. What you do choose should be a reflection of your thoughts and feelings, make you feel happy when you look at it, and help to tie the theme together in each room.",1

"It’s designed to be clean, safe — and blisteringly fast. It will not only keep you in touch with the world, but it can learn just what you like to watch or listen to. It is the Faraday Future FF91, and the folks who have designed it would you prefer you think of it as a “new species,” and not just another car.
The battery-electric crossover-utility vehicle made its debut at CES — formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show — in Las Vegas on Tuesday night, and Faraday promises to have the autonomous model in production by 2018. In fact, it has now opened up its online order bank allowing potential buyers to plunk down $5,000 deposits.
But those interested in the Faraday FF91 might be given a note of caution. The Chinese-funded, California-based start-up has run into a series of problems in recent months, a financial shortfall even forcing a temporary halt to construction of the sprawling assembly plant Faraday is putting up amidst the desert scrub on the north side of Las Vegas.
Despite such concerns, the mood was decidedly upbeat at the Pavilions at Las Vegas Market, the venue for the FF91 unveiling that drew thousands of journalists, Faraday employees, and “VIPs.” The event came just a year after the company showed off a supercar concept vehicle at CES, promising to be back with a production model.
That vehicle, the FF91, “doesn’t require any sacrifice,” declared Pete Savagian, Faraday’s director of propulsion engineering. “Never has it been more convenient to drive completely electric.”
Nor has driving ever been quite like what Faraday foresees. The FF91 is envisioned as much as a home away from home, with all the high-tech gadgets you could imagine. There are numerous high-definition screens inside the cabin, and with its redundant antennas and Wi-Fi, the car should be capable of keeping its occupants connected and entertained anywhere they go.
The FF91 will also have the ability to recognize, respond and adapt to its driver and passengers. Sensors will adjust vehicle settings, turn on music or videos, and otherwise act like a virtual assistant.
“It is the car that knows you, the car that adapts to you,” said Hong Bae, director of self-driving and other onboard technologies.
Looking like it had rolled off the set of a science fiction movie, the FF91’s design reflects the many functions it has been charged with performing. A variety of “active aero” body features — the vehicle raises or lowers automatically, for example — help to cheat the wind. Even modest improvements in aerodynamics, explained design chief Richard Kim, “can increase your range by 12 miles.”
So-called “range anxiety” is something Faraday is aiming to banish. With a massive, 130 kilowatt-hour battery pack — 30 percent larger than the biggest offered by rival Tesla Motors — the FF91 promises to get 378 miles per charge using the EPA test, though it could reach nearly 500 miles at a steady 55 mph, according to Savagian.
Improving aerodynamics also boosts performance, and Faraday claims that independent tests show the 1,050-horsepower FF91 will be the world’s fastest production vehicle, launching from 0 to 60 in a neck-snapping 2.39 seconds — several tenths faster than the most powerful Ferrari, the 488 GTB.
One of the most notable visual details on the FF91 is the glowing orb that appears to be mounted in the center of the hood. It’s a LIDAR, or 3D laser, unit, one of 36 different sensors built into the Faraday battery-car that make it possible to operate hands-free and even without a driver. During the two-hour presentation, Faraday showed how the FF91 could let out its occupants and then, with a tap of a smartphone app, head off on its own to find a parking spot.

While that demonstration went off without a hitch, another almost failed as YT Jia, the Chinese billionaire backing Faraday, tried to get the car to drive itself onto the stage for photographers. It took a technician a moment to climb into the car and correct a few settings before it obeyed.
The momentary holdup was little more than a hiccup, however, compared to other setbacks Faraday has experienced of late. Just last week, it was revealed that Ding Lei, the unofficial CEO for the company — which has no formal chief executive — had resigned. That followed the departure of a number of other high- and mid-level managers and executives, including chief brand officer Marco Mattiacci, and product marketing chief Joerg Sommer.
Faraday has meanwhile been sued for unpaid bills by a handful of suppliers and is struggling to pay others, though a senior company insider, asking not to be identified by name, said that, “We’re beginning to pay the bills” as new financing comes in. That will be critical, as a cash shortfall forced Faraday to halt work on the $1 billion assembly plant it is building in the desert north of Las Vegas.
Admitting there have been some rough moments, Nick Sampson, Faraday's Senior Vice President of R&D, told the audience, “We will persist,” later telling reporters that work on the Nevada factory will resume “very soon.”
Even if it does, there are plenty of skeptics who question how the company will be able to get it completed, checked out and in production in time to meet an admittedly aggressive production target. But Faraday officials insist they will come through and, in the process, “We will reformat the future,” promised Sampson.",0

"Everything Is Insider Trading Again
The personal-benefit test was nice while it lasted, but now it is gone.
The gift didn't work out well for him.
In order to convict someone ofcriminal insider trading, the government needs to prove not only that acorporate insider gave a tip of material nonpublic information to someone who traded on it; it also needs to prove that the insider got a ""personal benefit"" from tipping the trader. Atraditional personal benefit is for the trader to handthe insider a sack of cash representing his cut ofthe trading profits, but courts and prosecutors have a long history of expanding the test to include squishier benefits. Maybe the insider got some job advice from the tippee, or the satisfaction of conferring a gift on his brother-in-law, or the even weaker satisfaction of looking cool in the eyes of a tippee he barely knew. But then a few years ago the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in its Newman decision, ruled: No, the personal-benefit test is a real thing, you have to get a real benefit. Or, if you gave the information without expecting anything in return, it needs to have been givenin the context of a ""meaningfully close personal relationship."" The Supreme Court later narrowedthat a bit, ruling in the Salman decision that giving inside information to your brother isobviously insider trading, but it didn't really overrule Newman. A gift of inside information ""to family or friends"" is insider trading; it's the equivalent of the insider trading in his own account, and then giving the proceeds to his brother as a gift. It's stilla personal benefit to the insider, which is whatmakes it criminal: The insider is stealing corporate information to use for his own benefit.Mathew Martoma paid a doctor $1,000 an hour to tell him secret information about a public company's drug trials, and then traded on that information. I mean, technically Martoma's firm (SAC Capital) paidan expert-networking firm, whichpaid the doctor. And technically the payments were for general consultations, not explicitly for material nonpublic information about the drug trials the doctor was working on. But, come on. A thousand dollars an hour is clearly a ""personal benefit."" Martoma was obviously guilty of insider trading, and he was duly convicted, and yesterday the Second Circuit duly affirmed his conviction.
For some reason that I have never understood, Martoma's lawyers argued on appeal that he should have been acquitted because he didn't have a ""meaningfully close personal relationship"" with the doctor. ""That's what the money is for!"" would have been a perfectly sufficient answer, and indeed the Second Circuit more or less gave it.
But then it went on rather unnecessarily to reverse Newman and hold that anyway, no, you don't need a real personal benefit to satisfy the personal-benefit test.
Any ""gift"" to anyone, even a near-stranger in a commercial relationship, is enough:Thus, we hold that an insider or tipper personally benefits from a disclosure of inside information whenever the information was disclosed “with the expectation that [the recipient] would trade on it,” and the disclosure “resemble[s] trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient,” whether or not there was a “meaningfully close personal relationship” between the tipper and tippee.
And in a sense, that is fair enough. For instance:
Imagine that a corporate insider, instead of giving a cash end‐of‐year gift to his doorman, gives a tip of inside information with instructions to trade on the information and consider the proceeds of the trade to be his end‐of‐year gift.In this example, there may not be a “meaningfully close personal relationship” between the tipper and tippee, yet this clearly is an illustration of prohibited insider trading, as the insider has given a tip of valuable inside information in lieu of a cash gift and has thus personally benefitted from the disclosure.I think it is hard to argue that tipping your doorman with inside information, instead of cash, shouldn'tbe insider trading.
But Judge Rosemary Pooler dissented, and I think her dissent is more fundamentally correct:Today, the majority holds that an insider receives a personal benefit when the insider gives inside information as a “gift” to any person. In holding that someone who gives a gift always receives a personal benefit from doing so, the majority strips the long‐standing personal benefit rule of its limiting power. What counts as a “gift” is vague and subjective. Juries, and, more dangerously, prosecutors, can now seize on this vagueness and subjectivity. The result will be liability in many cases where it could not previously lie.
The word ""gift,"" without restriction, expands insider-trading liability dramatically: If you give information in exchange for a benefit, then you satisfy the personal-benefit test; if you give the information in exchange for nothing, then you satisfy the ""gift"" test. Everything is insider trading. Judge Pooler again:Any disclosure of material, non‐public information clearly resembles a gift, in that it provides the recipient with something of value. The rule limiting the gift theory to relatives and friends made it largely unnecessary to ask what distinguished a “gift” from a non‐gift disclosure, in that most insiders have few reasons beyond gift‐giving to sharevaluable business secrets with close friends or family members. But in other cases, simply telling a jury to distinguish between a disclosure that is a gift, as opposed to one that is not, with no further guidance, invites decision‐making that is entirely arbitrary and subjective.Maybe that seems fine. But in the Newman case itself, two hedge-fund managers were convicted of insider trading because an investor-relations employee at Dell had disclosed information to an analyst, who disclosed it to other analysts, and it eventually made its way to the managers. Did the investor-relations employee give the analyst that information as a ""gift""? Or did he give it out just because, you know, he was an investor-relations employee whose job was to speak to analysts? Those can be hard to tell apart: If you are an investor-relations employee who talks to analysts all day, you will probably have a more pleasant day if they like you. Soyou try to be helpful and friendly. Maybe you gave them too much information because you were trying too hard -- but in good faith -- to be helpful and friendly. Maybe you gave them too much information because you wanted to give them an illicit gift of inside information.How would a jury be able to tell?The Newman appeals court looked at the facts and said: Look, they weren't close friends, the IR employee didn't really get anything of value, it just doesn't look like the sort of nefarious disclosure that should create criminal insider-trading liability. The IR employee wasn't stealing the information to use it illicitly for his own benefit, so there's no criminal insider trading here. That analysis struck me as right, and still does. The Martoma court washed it away.
The essential purpose of insider trading law is to punish corporate insiderswho use inside information for their own benefit, while allowing corporate insiders to use inside informationfor legitimate business purposes. That much is straightforward. But a secondary purpose of criminalinsider trading law really ought to be to grudgingly allowcorporate insiders to use inside information for a wide range of semi-legitimate purposes -- neither straightforwardbusiness purposes nor straightforward self-enrichment -- that just shouldn't be crimes.A chief executive officer telling a golf buddy about an upcoming merger: bad (and illegal). A CEO telling a potential competing bidderabout a pending merger,subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement, in order to induce a higher bid: good (and legal). A CEO telling a big hedge fund about an plannedasset salein order to get itssupport, or a bankertelling a journalist about an upcoming merger in order to get good coverage in the press, or a whistle-blower telling a reporter about a fraud in order to expose it,
or an investor relations employee telling a research analyst a piece of data she wasn't supposed to because she wanted her dayto be more pleasant: ehhhhhh.You can dislikethose things, but they shouldn't becrimes; they are not the misuse of corporate information to enrich the insider or her buddies. They are just stuff that happens in the market, part of a constant exchange of information driven by motives that are a mix ofpersonal and corporate, selfish and selfless.But are they ""gifts""? Now that is for a jury to decide.

"Dr. Phil’s “thank you for that” makes this clip.Nothing about that situation should have been funny but for some reason the way he said it along with his face was inadvertently way too funny.
I can’t even stand to stomach the show for a second. At least with Jerry Springer there was this unsaid recognition that everyone was just laughing at sideshow freaks who were probably acting. This is like fetishizing the humiliation of wayward teens. There’s this creepy insincere ‘Oliver Twist’ style helping hand extended to messedup kids, only to turn them into future suicide victims. I wish that kid was acting.
This girl certainly comes off as a trouble maker and could use some guidance but instead she got put on national TV and turned into a meme. Now she gets harassed online about it, gets in fights over it, even has suicide rumors spread about her. She was not perfect to begin with, but all of thisis just going to mess her up more.",1
"On a cool and rainy afternoon during the first week of classes at Centennial High School in this well-to-do Baltimore suburb, about 50 members of the boys' cross-country team sauntered across the parking lot for their after-school run.
Meanwhile, about 30 kids in helmets and pads were going through drills on the pristine artificial turf field at the school's hillside football stadium.
""It used to be the other way around,"" said Al Dodds, Centennial's cross-country coach, who has 64 boys on his team this year. ""Now, there's a small turnout in football and cross-country is huge.""
Across the athletic complex, a practice football field sat empty, even though it was recently mown and painted with yardage lines and hash marks. In years past, the junior-varsity team would have been relegated to that grass field. But on this day they had the stadium to themselves, as they will for every practice this fall. Centennial isn't fielding a varsity football team because not enough kids signed up to play.
The situation at Centennial — where a long history of losing has dampened students' enthusiasm for football — is unique to this part of central Maryland, but there are plenty of similar examples around the U. S. Participation in high school football is down 3.5 percent over the past five years, according to the annual survey by the National Association of State High School Federations, or NFHS.
The decline would be much steeper if not for a handful of states in the South and the West. Throughout the Northeast, the Midwest and the West Coast, in communities urban and rural, wealthy and working-class, fewer kids are playing football.
""I've never been interested in football,"" said 16-year-old Zach Deming, a cross-country runner at Centennial with the solid build of a defensive back. ""I'm afraid of getting hurt badly,like getting a serious concussion.""
The risks of football have never been more apparent. This summer, researchers at Boston University said they'd found evidence of a brain disease linked to repeated head blows in nearly all of the 202 former football players they studied. The athletes whose brains were donated to the study had played football in the National Football League, college and even high school.
The report doesn't confirm chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, is common in all football players, because many donors or their families participated in the study because of the players' troubling symptoms.
After years of denials, the NFL acknowledged a link between head blows and brain disease and agreed in 2015 to a $1 billion settlement to compensate former players who had accused the league of hiding the risks.
""There's no question about it. The amount of publicity, beginning with the NFL and what you see on national news, has caused concern among parents,"" said Bob Gardner, the NFHS executive director. ""Probably some who would have been more inclined to let their young men play, maybe are making different decisions now.""
A study published last month in the medical journal Translational Psychiatry showed that kids who played football before age 12 were more than twice as likely to have mood and behavior problems.
The news hasn't escaped the parents at Centennial, one of the top-rated public high schools in Maryland, where 97 percent of students go on to college after they graduate. Just 10 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, an indicator of poverty.
""Families around here are more into academics,"" Zach said.
Maryland is one of 14 states where participation in football was down 10 percent or more over the past five years, according to NFHS data. In all, 41 states saw a decline between the 2011-12 and 2016-17 school years, and just nine states and the District of Columbia saw increases.
In West Windsor Township, New Jersey, which borders Princeton University and has a median household income of $137,000, one of the two public high schools dropped varsity football this year, and the other might have to do the same next year.
Trinity High School in Manchester, New Hampshire, also disbanded its varsity team, with hopes that it could return in a lower division next year.
At the first practice, the team ""had three seniors, one junior, 12 sophomores and one freshman,"" athletic director Chip Polak told the New Hampshire Union Leader in August. ""Two of the seniors have never played any kind of organized football and the other senior is dealing with concussion symptoms.""
In Ventura County, California, northeast of Los Angeles, Thousand Oaks High School disbanded its junior-varsity team this season because it needed sophomores and juniors to fill out the varsity roster. In Marin County, north of San Francisco, Novato High School announced that it wouldn't field a varsity team this year, but the program got a last-minute reprieve when more athletes than expected showed up for practice.
The decline in participation isn't just limited to wealthy, coastal communities. Among the states where participation is down more than 10 percent are Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois. Population in Illinois has also declined over that period, while in Michigan and Wisconsin it has only grown slightly.
Researchers at the University of Colorado, who studied data from the NFHS and the Census, said in an analysis published Sept. 26 that high school football participation peaked in 2009 before beginning a decline that is likely to continue.
The NFL is paying attention to the numbers and trying to find ways to get kids playing the sport.
""It is important for kids to play sports because it's healthy, it's fun, and they learn important values,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. ""Of course, we think football is the best team sport and we aim to ensure there are a range options for young players today — both tackle and flag.""
While participation in tackle football is down, flag football is becoming more popular. Participation in the NFL Flag program run by USA Football for kids ages 6-17 increased by 66 percent from 2013 to 2016, with 385,000 kids playing last year.
In high schools, the expense of the sport and increasing specialization by young athletes are also factors. And while football is declining, other sports are growing, among them soccer and lacrosse. But football is different because it remains the nation's most popular spectator sport, and schools expect to sell tickets on Friday nights.
""The key thing about football is that it's such an important part of the financial picture of schools. Some of these schools rely on the attendance in high school football to pay for these other sports,"" Gardner said. ""While we certainly applaud the growth of all sports, we remain vigilant about what's going on in football because of the economic impact.""
Around the Centennial football program, there is optimism that varsity football could return next year if the JV team can put together a reasonably competitive season. The team has a strong freshman class, some of whom have never played organized football before.
Toward the end of the 2-hour practice, coaches wanted the first-team defense to get some full-speed reps. That required some creativity.
""If you're not on first-team defense, I need 11 of you to make an offense,"" an assistant coach barked. ""I need a running back, I need a fullback, I need five linemen, I need a tight end, I need two wide receivers. Let's go!""",0
"Via an article in Natural News regarding vitamin D deficiency: The importance of vitamin D is well known. As far back as the 1930s, doctors first recognized the link between a vitamin D deficiency and the skeletal disease called rickets. Rickets causes a softening of the bones and teeth. Even if someone’s diet has adequate levels of calcium, without enough vitamin D to properly control calcium and phosphate levels in the blood stream, demineralization of the bones can take place. The symptoms of rickets include bowed legs, bone pain, dental problems, a widening of the wrists, frequent bone fractures and skull deformities.
Because rickets is seldom seen in first-world countries, it’s easy to think that vitamin D deficiencies are a thing of the past. However, new research has recently shed light on other, more subtle, symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency. Many illnesses which, at first glance, seem totally unrelated to something as physically obvious as rickets actually may have their roots in a lack of vitamin D.
Just what is vitamin D?
The term vitamin D, according to the Mayo Clinic’s Drugs and Supplements site (1), actually refers to several different forms of the vitamin, including D2, which comes from our diet, and D3, which is manufactured by our skin when exposed to sunlight. Vitamin D’s main purpose in the body is to regulate blood levels of calcium and phosphorous.
It’s actually hard to get enough vitamin D from a normal diet. It’s found at the highest concentration in fatty fish such as tuna, mackerel and salmon. Some mushrooms are also high in D, and their level of the vitamin actually increases when exposed to ultraviolet light.
While our skin does manufacture some of the vitamin D that we need daily, sun exposure alone is usually not enough. Factors such as the time of year, the angle of the sun, cloud cover, pollution levels and even the use of sunscreen can greatly limit the amount of D made by our skin.
Some people who have a vitamin D deficiency have no immediate symptoms. Those who do have symptoms may experience restless sleep, muscle cramps, general fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain or weakness, inability to concentrate, headaches, constipation or diarrhea, and bladder problems. Here are nine other serious medical conditions that have been linked to a vitamin D deficiency.
Asthma – Vitamin D supplementation of 1,200 IU daily has been shown to lessen asthma attacks and reduce their severity.
Depression – Vitamin D deficiencies have been linked to depression and other psychiatric illnesses. Even a woman getting enough D during pregnancy has been shown to lessen the chances that her unborn child will develop mental illness later in life.
Heart disease – An article published in Molecular Nutrition & Food Research (2) reports that cardiovascular disease is much more common in people deficient in vitamin D. Some children, according to the article, with severe heart failure have also responded well to vitamin D treatment.
High blood pressure – High blood pressure has been associated with deficiencies in calcium, magnesium, potassium and vitamin D.
Rheumatoid Arthritis – RA is a devastating disease that causes systemic inflammation, severe pain and joint damage. Studies have shown that vitamin D can ease the pain and stiffness associated with RA.
Multiple sclerosis – Studies have shown that geography matters when it comes to the odds of getting MS. The farther from the equator you live — and the less sun exposure you get — the more likely you are to develop the disease. This suggests a strong link between MS and vitamin D.
Cancer – Several different kinds of cancer have been linked to D deficiencies, including breast cancer, prostate cancer and colon cancer. The causal link is so strong, in fact, that the Mayo Clinic (3) lists separate recommended dosing levels of the vitamin for both cancer prevention and prostate cancer treatment.
Periodontal disease – This inflammation of the gums can cause pain, bleeding and tooth loss. Vitamin D helps in the formation of defensins and cathelicidins which, in turn, can lower the number of harmful bacteria in the mouth.
Diabetes – An article from World’s Healthiest Foods (4) lists poor blood-sugar control as a symptom of vitamin D deficiency. This, in turn, can increase the risk of developing diabetes.",1
"any years ago, I spent one glorious autumn in northern Spain, foraging and cooking as we travelled. We drove through long, cavernous valleys threaded with fast-flowing rivers lined with fig trees, and I was amazed by how sticky and sweet their fruit was, left unpicked until well ripened. Here, we can cheat that effect by giving the figs a spell in the oven, aided by honey, spice and citrus. A pork chop is the perfect bedfellow, with the figs acting as an exotic alternative to our more native apple. And in this recipe, a little fig goes a long way.
The tangy juices, scented with anise, honey and orange, are perfect with buttery mash. Serves four.
4 slender bone-in pork chops, excess fat trimmed (I like them about 1cm thick)
For the marinade
2 tbsp sherry vinegar
3 tbsp olive oil, plus 1 tbsp extra for frying
2 tbsp runny honey
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed with a little salt
A handful of thyme leaves
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
For the mash
1kg floury potato such as Maris Piper, peeled and cut into even chunks
100g butter
75ml whole milk
For the figs
6 figs, halved
1 star anise, ground
Zest of  orange
1 tbsp runny honey
1 tbsp olive oil
4 tbsp oloroso sherry or madeira
Mix all the marinade ingredients in a large bowl, season generously, then rub all over the chops. Cover and put in the fridge for at least an hour and not longer than overnight (garlic can deteriorate). Remove from the fridge half an hour before you plan to cook, so the chops come up to room temperature.
Put the potatoes in a pan of salted water, bring to a boil, then simmer for 15-20 minutes, until soft. Meanwhile, in another pan, melt half the butter in the milk over a medium heat. Drain the potatoes into a colander, leave them to steam dry for a few minutes, then return to the pan and mash in the pan (or use a ricer), until smooth. Pour in the buttery milk, mash again, season to taste and keep warm.
When you’re ready to eat, heat a baking tray in a 200C/390F/gas mark 6 oven. Generously season the figs, and toss them gently in a bowl with the star anise, orange zest, honey, oil, and a little salt and pepper.
Shake off any excess marinade from the chops, then heat a frying pan on a medium-high flame. Add the last tablespoon of oil, then fry the chops for two minutes on each side, until golden; depending on the size of your pan, you may need to do this in two batches. Transfer to a plate and keep warm.
In the same pan, sear the cut sides of the figs for five seconds or so, until coloured, then transfer to the pork plate.
Put a dash of oil in the hot baking tray, then lay in the chops and arrange the figs cut side up around them. Drizzle any fig marinade over the fruit, then roast for six to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chops, until cooked through. (I err on pink and juicy if they are free-range to avoid a dry chop.)
Once cooked, put the meat and figs on a plate and leave to rest somewhere warm for five minutes (or wrap lightly in foil). Meanwhile, put the baking tray on a medium-high flame, add the sherry, and scrape up any burnt bits as it bubbles and reduces by half – this will take about a minute.
Gently reheat the potato and stir in the remaining butter. Put a chop and some mash on each plate, and spoon the figs and sauce over the mash; some green beans or wilted greens would be a welcome side.
Figs go very well with lamb, too. Try them in a tagine with carrot and coriander seed, and a honey and citrus sauce. Or keep the star anise in the mix and pair the figs with a slab of creamy soft cheese for a very easy yet sophisticated pudding.",0
"Fish can be trained to recognize human faces, researchers reported on Tuesday.
Fish don’t have the brain structure, called the neocortex, that people and domestic animals use to recognize faces. But the team at the University of Queensland in Australia managed to train fish to tell one human face from another, anyway.
The fish were up to 89 percent accurate in telling apart human faces on a computer screen, the team reported in the journal Scientific Reports.
“We show that archerfish (Toxotes chatareus) can learn to discriminate a large number of human face images, even after controlling for color, head-shape and brightness,” they wrote.
The fish were already trained to recognize images on a computer screen suspended over the tank, Cait Newport of Queensland and Oxford universities and her colleagues said.
They used archerfish, which spit streams of water to knock down insects and other goodies to eat. This means they need to have good vision to start with. “This species, known for knocking down aerial prey with jets of water, relies heavily on vision to detect small prey against a visually complex background and demonstrates impressive visual cognitive abilities,” the team wrote.
So they trained the fish, rewarding them with food pellets when they got it right. The fish became very good at recognizing the different faces.
It must be a different brain function than people and other animals use.
“There is evidence from a range of studies that some non-primate mammals can discriminate human faces. Species which have been tested include sheep, dogs , cows and horses,” the team wrote.
Related: Bees See Your Face as a Strange Flower
“However, most animals tested possess a neocortex and have been domesticated, and may, as a result, have experienced evolutionary pressure to recognize their human carers. There is some evidence that animals lacking a neocortex, namely bees and birds, are capable of some degree of human facial discrimination.”
Crows and pigeons have been shown to recognize human faces especially well. Crows even recognize people in masks.",0

Mark O'Mara: America appears to have settled its gun debate
He says inflexible owners must view school shooting as collateral of ""right"" to bear arms
He says we don't further restrict drinking because of DWI. Have we made that deal on guns?
O'Mara: Face it: Restricting guns won't hurt Constitution, cause anarchy; it will protect us
Mark O'Mara is a CNN legal analyst. He is a criminal defense attorney who frequently writes and speaks about issues related to race, guns and self-defense in the context of the American criminal justice system. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
(CNN)Gun debate? What gun debate? Americans seem to have this settled.
Yes, we witnessed on our TV screens this week yet another parade of children being evacuated from their school — this time in Oregon -- their arms held high to show they were not armed as they fled a 15-year-old shooter who police said took the life of their 14-year-old classmate.
Mark O'Mara
But Americans, ever more desensitized to the school/mall/navy yard attacks that come, weekly, into their lives, don't seem to want to talk about a gun problem. Americans remain pleased for the general population -- even 15-year-old kids -- to have nearly unfettered access to all manner of firearms, including assault rifles. Even the President seems to have acquiesced. A tweet from @WhiteHouse: ""'If public opinion does not demand change in Congress, it will not change.' -- President Obama on legislation to prevent gun violence.""
What this means is that we've accepted school shootings and other random mass shootings as a normal part of life in America, no matter how they affect the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness that was first announced in the Declaration of Independence, some 13 years before our oft-quoted Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
I guess that's not surprising: We accept collateral damage for other privileges we enjoy. We tolerate a certain number of drunk driving deaths, more than 10,000 in 2012, and there's little public outcry for greater restrictions. We've been willing to sacrifice nearly 7,000 soldiers (and tens of thousands wounded) in two wars to maintain our political influence in the Middle East. About 400 children drown each year in pools and spas, but we're not scrambling to outlaw summer fun.

Why should guns be any different? In the United States only about 10 people out of every 100,000 are killed by guns, or a little more than 30,000 per year (As a reference, we lost about 60,000 soldiers in the Vietnam War).
This is clearly an acceptable sacrifice to make to maintain our sacred, un-infringed right to bear arms, no?

After all, I've been told by some gun-rights advocates that reasonable restrictions on gun ownership will undoubtedly send us down a slippery slope to the abolition of all guns in America. And if we didn't have unfettered access to guns, think about what would happen: We would be overrun by a foreign power; our government would assume totalitarian control and burn the Constitution; and criminal gangs, the only people left with guns, would run roughshod over all law-abiding citizens.
If you suggest, as I have, that we should place reasonable restrictions on guns, then you are clearly a delusional or ignorant pacifist who has been dropped on his head. What part of ""shall not be infringed"" don't you understand? they ask. (For the record, I'm a responsible gun owner.)
I'm confident that in the next few weeks there will be another school shooting. I'm confident because there have been 74 shootings on or around schools or colleges in the year and a half since the Sandy Hook massacre. That's averaging one a week.
I'll repeat: We have a gun problem in this country.
Reasonable restrictions on guns will not lead to totalitarianism and anarchy. Suffering 30,000 gun deaths annually is not a reasonable sacrifice to make in order to blindly maintain our unrestricted gun culture, particularly when the rallying cry is an outdated reference concerning infringement which, known to anyone who has actually studied the Constitution and our founding fathers who drafted it, was a reference to the then-existing reality that young men, when called upon to defend the state and the laws of the state, were expected to provide their own arms.
Listen, reasonable restrictions are necessary to assure the continued viability of our Second Amendment rights, and to curb the unnecessary bloodshed caused by the proliferation of guns into hands of irresponsible people who care little about constitutional rights, and less about the sanctity of life. Like that of a boy in Oregon, who was shot dead.

"Waymo is taking the next step in the driverless car evolution            Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.    You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.
Waymo is taking back-up drivers out of some of its Chrysler Pacifica minivans, shown here in California, a significant step in setting up a commercial driverless service. (Waymo)  The brain-bending, potentially earth-moving technology that allows self-driving cars to drive themselves has generally come with an asterisk – in the form of an old-fashioned flesh-and-blood driver sitting behind the wheel, just in case. But Waymo is taking human chaperones out of some of its driverless vehicles in Arizona, a significant step toward launching an ambitious, paid car service to ferry around the general public. Waymo Chief Executive John Krafcik said Tuesday that the company, which grew out of Google’s self-driving car initiative, has begun running some of its fully autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans without a human backup in the driver’s seat. It’s starting in a swath of Chandler, Az., and will spread over time through “the entire Phoenix region, which is larger than Greater London,” according to remarks by Krafcik at the Web Summit in Lisbon. Initially, the shortstop-free robo-cars will not carry members of the public, the company said. But that step is coming fast – “in the next few months,” Krafcik said. For now, passengers will be engineers and other company representatives, continuing an eight-year testing program with 3.5 million miles under its belt. It will open up first to families in its Early Rider program, who are already using Waymo’s autonomous cars (with a just-in-case driver) as part of their routines, giving the company insights into everyday use. Waymo executives see removing the human backstop as a natural part of the evolution of their rigorous technology – and as a vital step in finally tapping all the commercial and social benefits they and other advocates of autonomous driving promise. It will be good for the old and the young, the blind and blotto, and save lives in the process, by starting to remove fallible humanity from the highway equation, boosters say.  Numerous companies are competing to take a bite out of the massive global transportation sector, trying to create a new profit center in the process. Waymo competitors, including Uber have said ditching human drivers could remake the economics of taxi services, ridesharing and freight hauling. Critics however continue to warn that technologists are too rosy about their ability to tame the confusing, treacherous and potentially deadly randomness of road travel. Skeptics also say federal regulators have not done enough to set basic safety standards for technology firms or car companies to meet. The U. S. Department of Transportation has set up a voluntary system that allows companies to describe their safety features to officials in Washington, but does not require them to do so. Congress is considering putting some safety disclosure requirements in place. Waymo last month became the first company to make a voluntary safety self-assessment public, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Krafcik said Waymo’s cars have already driven autonomously the equivalent of 140 times around the globe, and in just the last year have driven billions of miles in simulation. Now, the company is contemplating what’s next. “You can re-imagine the very idea of what a vehicle is. Because they no longer have to be designed around a driver, just people,” Krafcik said. That will allow them to be built for very specific tasks, he said – “one for napping, a personal dining room, a mobile office.” And the norms of ride-sharing, like grabbing an Lyft for a 20-minute ride to work or from a bar, will be shaken up, offering numerous new options. “You can even have that eight-seater SUV for your weekend trips. You could take these vehicles for one ride, for a day, for a week, or even longer,” Krafcik said. “Our role will shift from a driver to that of a full-time passenger,” he said. “We want the experience of traveling with Waymo to be routine, so you want to use our driver for your everyday needs.”",0
"If you are trying to quit smoking, you should know that nicotine leaves the system only after 48 to 72 hours.  However, we will show you a way to flush it out of your body!
The cream of tartar is a byproduct of the wine making process, and it effectively helps the elimination of nicotine from the system.
What’s more, it is inexpensive and affordable, and can provide various other benefits, even to non-smokers!
Chemists often use the cream of tartar in a powder form, and it is technically known as potassium hydrogen tartrate. It is, in fact, a sediment from the bottom of a wine barrel.
Here are 5 amazing benefits of the cream of tartar:
1 – it helps you quit Smoking
Despite flushing nicotine from the body, the cream of tartar can help you no longer stand the cigarette taste. If you mix it with orange juice, it will of great help!
The high vitamin C content in the orange juice will also help you pull out the nicotine, and it will also restore the lost vitamin amount.
You should mix a medium glass of orange juice with half a teaspoon of cream of tartar, and consume this drink every night for a month.
2 – It reduces Blood Pressure
Low potassium levels in the body increase the risk of high blood pressure issues, but the cream of tartar can help you in this case as well, as 100 grams of cream of tartar include amazing 16,500 milligrams of potassium.
If the potassium deficiency is the cause for your high blood pressure issues, you should add a teaspoon of the cream of tartar to a glass of water and drink it every night before going to sleep.
3 – It relieves Urinary Tract Infections
It effectively relieves urinary tract infections as it changes the pH levels in the urine, and creates an environment which destroys bacteria which cause the infection. In a cup of warm water, add one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar, a few drops of lemon juice, and consume it a few times daily.
4 – It relieves the pain due to arthritis
100 grams of cream of tartar have 2 milligrams of magnesium, which, according to Dr. Sircus, “modulates cellular events involved in inflammation.” Therefore, the cream of tartar is especially beneficial in the case of arthritis. Just add a couple of tablespoons of cream of tartar and 3 tablespoons of Epsom salt to your bath, and soak in it for 30-40 minutes once or twice a day. On the other hand, if the arthritis pain is localized, you can use a bucket, and soak only the affected area in water with half the quantities of the ingredients given above.
5 – Clear Acne
The acidic properties of the cream of tartar make it perfect skin cleaning, and acne-fighting agent.
However, it should not be applied directly, but you should drink a teaspoon of it in a glass with 8 ounces of water or orange juice on a daily basis. This will detoxify the system and destroy the bacteria which cause acne.

"Listening to someone complain, even if it’s yourself, has never done anyone any good. Some people say that it may act as a catharsis, a way to let go of negative emotions and experiences, and maybe letting it all out once in a while does feel good, but taking a closer look at what complaining actually does to the brain gives us even more cause to strive for a positive frame of mind and cut out the complaining.
The brain is a complex physical organ that somehow works in tandem with consciousness to create the personality of a human being, always learning, always re-creating and re-generating itself. It is both the product of reality and the creator of reality, and science is finally beginning to under stand how the brain actually creates reality.
Author, computer scientist and philosopher, Steven Parton, examined the ways in which negative emotions in the form of complaining, both expressed by the self and experienced from others, affect the brain and body, coming up with a number of keen observations that help us to understand why some people can’t seem to get out of a negative mood.
His theory suggests that negativity and complaining actually physically alters the structure and function of the mind and body.
“Synapses that fire together wire together,” says Parton, which is a concise way of understanding the essence of neuroplasticity, the science of how the brain re-wires itself based on whatever it is repetitively exposed to. Negativity and complaining breeds more of the same, as this theory points out.
“The principle is simple: Throughout your brain there is a collection of synapses separated by empty space called the synaptic cleft. Whenever you have a thought, one synapse shoots a chemical across the cleft to another synapse, thus building a bridge over which an electric signal can cross, carrying along its charge the relevant information you’re thinking about.
…Every time this electrical charge is triggered, the synapses grow closer together in order to decrease the distance the electrical charge has to cross…. The brain is rewiring its own circuitry, physically changing itself, to make it easier and more likely that the proper synapses will share the chemical link and thus spark together–in essence, making it easier for the thought to trigger.”
Furthermore, his understanding of this process includes the idea that the electrical connections most utilized by the brain will become shorter, and therefore more frequently chosen for use by the brain. This is how one’s personality is altered.
However, as conscious beings, we have the power to affect this process, simply by being aware of how the universal play of duality is at work in the nascent moments of thoughts. We have the power to choose to generate thoughts from the consciousness of love, over fear, thereby ensuring that the brain and personality are positively altered.
There is more to this action than just the effect that complaining has on the self. This line of scientific reasoning extends to the dynamics between two-people, giving scientific understanding of how one’s complaining brings other people down.
Mirror-neurons ensure that we learn from our environment, and are the essential bio-chemical element of empathy. The brain relates to what another person is expressing, and the empathic portion of ourselves responds by ‘trying on’ this emotion as an attempt to relate to and understand the externally unfolding drama.
So, when a person enters and drops a huge boatload of gossip, negativity and drama on you, you can be assured that it is affecting you bio-chemically, and is decreasing your chances of actually being happy. Exposure to this kind of emotional outburst actually causes stress, and because stress kills, complaining and negativity may seriously be contributing to your early demise.
Parton refers to this outlook as ‘the science of happiness,’ and the example of the behavior of complaining does make a fitting case study for the connection between the power of thought and the amount of control a person can exert on the creation of our shared, three-dimensional reality.
The overall view of this is even further condensed, rather precisely, by Parton:
“…if you’re always complaining and belittling your own power in reality, you will not think you have the power to change it. And thus it will never change.”",1
"Few scents are as refreshing as that of a lemon. As it turns out, that smell is not only refreshing – it’s also good for you! In this article, we’re going to explore the benefits of making your very own natural lemon air freshener.
How might one create such a thing, you ask? Easy! All you’ve gotta do is grab a lemon, slice it into quarters and sprinkle some salt on it. Boom. Done.
I know I’m not the only one whose stresses and anxieties tend to build up around bedtime. Some lemon slices on the nightstand will take care of that in a jiffy, though. You see, according to research, the smell of citrus relaxes one’s brain waves and emotions.
This leads nicely to the next point.
Why would you need focus at bedtime, you ask? Well, it’s actually quite helpful – especially if you’re an insomniac whose brain tends to race all over the place. If that’s you, psychologists say a good night’s sleep depends on a few key things.
For one, you’ve got to focus on positive things – and, perhaps, relaxation exercises – that will get you in a state of mind conducive to rest. That’s where focus-boosting lemon fragrance comes in handy.
Every time I try to sleep with a stuffy nose, I’m reminded of the times I took the simple pleasure of breathing for granted. Luckily, for those less-than-clear moments, we can call on lemons. Just let the gentle scent of that anti-oxidizing, anti-bacterial fruit waft through your nostrils and sleep, child. Sleep.
Tired of mosquitoes making a meal of you at night? Or maybe it’s that fly buzzing around your ear that’s got you going insane. Fear no more! Our friendly neighborhood yellow fruit repels all sorts of insects. Those slices will keep them on the other side of the room.
You can add cloves for added insect-repellent effects, as seen in the video above.
I know, morning is the last thing you want to think about as you climb into bed. But those slices on your nightstand will make wake-up time a lot less painful. That’s because the smell of lemon boosts your brain’s serotonin levels. This is a surefire way to ditch those morning blues.
When’s the last time you thought about your home’s air quality? Not sure? Quick, get those slices! Lemon not only smells great – it also purifies air. It’s so powerful, in fact, that you can use it to quickly draw paint fumes out of a room.
Lemon aroma reduces blood pressure. Considering 32% of all Americans suffer from high blood pressure, that makes lemon one handy fruit for a lot of people.",1
"You can’t live without this vitamin. But the FDA wants to reserve the natural form for monopoly drug companies, leaving only the synthetic form for supplements. Urgent Action Alert! The FDA has just released a new 109-proposed rule on the revision of nutrition and supplement labels. (You can read more about the implications of the new labeling rules in our other article this week.) On page 69, the agency slipped in two little paragraphs that could risk the health of millions of people who desperately need folate. It’s a sneak attack so quiet and unobtrusive that few people will even realize it’s there.
According to the guidance, the word “folate” will be banned from the Supplement Fact labels— only the term “folic acid” will be allowed. Folate is the naturally occurring form of the water-soluble vitamin B9. It is found in foods such as black-eyed peas, chickpeas and other beans, lentils, spinach, turnip greens, asparagus, avocado, and broccoli, but is also available as a supplement. The human body needs folate to synthesize and repair its DNA. It’s especially important during the kind of rapid cell division and growth seen in infancy and pregnancy. Children and adults both require folate to produce healthy red blood cells and prevent anemia among many other vital functions. Folic acid, on the other hand, is synthetically produced, and refers to just one member of the folate group:
Pteroylmonoglutamic acid. While folic acid occurs only rarely in whole foods, it’s extremely stable, which is why it’s widely used in dietary supplements and to fortify processed foods. The important thing to remember is that folic acid is not itself biologically active, though for most people the liver can convert it to the folate we need. Most, however, does not mean all. It’s estimated that 30% to 40% of the population can’t efficiently convert synthetic folic acid into folate.
In other words, about a third of the human population has two potential problems: a deficiency in folate (because it is hard to get enough from a diet full of processed foods), and possibly even an excess of folic acid (because their body can’t metabolize what could become an overabundance of folic acid present in “fortified” foods): According to Dr. Jonathan V. Wright, folate deficiency is one of the most dangerous medical conditions, leading to Alzheimer’s and other brain diseases. If pregnant women are deficient in it, it can also lead to spina bifida and other neural tube birth defects in their children. On the other hand, too much unmetabolized folic acid can build up in the blood, which could lead to an increased risk of prostate, lung, and colon cancer, or worsen already present cancerous lesions.
This refers to large amounts of folic acid, larger than in current supplements, but more research is needed to account for individual differences. Note that the FDA is not exactly banning the inclusion of folate and requiring the inclusion of folic acid in supplements. As usual, it is playing a much more subtle insider’s game.
It is simply banning supplement producers from using the word folate on their labels and conversely only allowing the word folic acid on their labels. But it would of course be fraudulent to put folic acid on your label and then use something else. The FDA understands that perfectly. So on what grounds is the agency banning the use of the word folate on the label? Believe it or not, it is arguing that folate can only be found in “conventional” (whole or minimally processed) foods. Before we examine this absurd claim, we must first explain that limiting a folate claim to food would not prevent drug companies from becoming the only source of folate outside of food.
Drug companies don’t care what a chemical is called so long as they can create a high priced monopoly in it. Ironically, the FDA’s position that folate can only be used to describe what is in food would still turn folate over to the drug companies—so long as supplement labels can only use the term folic acid. So what about the agency’s assertion that “folate” can only be found in food? “Folate” is actually a term for a whole B vitamin group. The term “folate” we see on dietary supplement labels refers to “dietary folates,” members of the folate group that can be naturally found in foods.
Folinic acid (5-FTHF), calcium methylfolate, and various other tetrahydrofolates can be found in dietary supplements. Many brands feature dietary folate. It would be completely inaccurate and misleading to refer to these dietary folates as “folic acid.” Legally, it would be fraudulent. Why did the FDA do this? One can only guess. But it would not be surprising if it eventually turns out to be a blatant attempt to reserve for drug companies the use of dietary folates. After all, B vitamins are not only essential for life. They are also proven therapeutic agents.
Drug company research programs have been coming up short for years; new drug therapeutic agents are in very short supply. Moreover, the drug company Merck already holds patents on Metafolin, which the body recognizes as a bioavailable dietary folate. Metafolin is licensed by dietary supplement companies for some of their products. If, according to FDA “logic,” dietary supplements can’t contain folate like Metafolin, it would only be available from whole foods… or drugs, and only from drugs in higher doses.
Since Merck would have exclusivity for a Metafolin “drug,” our guess is that they would make billions. And other forms of patentable folate could then follow. Sound unlikely? It’s not—both forms of fish oil and vitamin D have already been turned into patented drugs. Imagine if competition from supplemental forms of fish oil or D could be wiped out at one stroke by saying no supplement label could use the term! Let’s also keep in mind the case of pyridoxamine, one of the natural forms of vitamin B6, another B vitamin critical to human health. In 2009, Biostratum, the manufacturer of a proposed pyridoxamine-based drug called Pyridorin intended to prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease), filed a petition with the FDA asking to ban the natural form.
The agency agreed to do so. It announced that pyridoxamine dihydrochloride was a “new drug” — which means the FDA effectively prevented any substance containing pyridoxamine from being marketed as a dietary supplement. Never mind that the fish on your lunch salad and the chicken on your dinner table both contain pyridoxamine, as does brewer’s yeast! Never mind that vitamin B6 in general has been in supplements for decades and therefore ought to be grandfathered under federal supplement legislation.
The agency simply stated that because supplement bottles in earlier decades had not distinguished between the particular type of B6 included, they could ban it! The natural alternative to pyridoxamine, one with similar health and anti-glycation properties, is another B6 compound called pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, or P5P. This is the only form of B6 that can be used directly by the body without conversion. While everyone needs B6 to live, some people have difficulty converting other forms of B6 to P5P. P5P exists in food, and has been available as a supplement for years. But even P5P has been under threat! The FDA has a petition from Medicure Pharma to ban P5P.
Thanks to grassroots activists like you, the FDA hasn’t acted on that petition yet — but if the petition is approved, we will have to wait until we get sick enough to obtain a prescription for the drug. We’ll no longer be able to maintain good health and prevent aging and diseases like cancer by proactively keeping P5P at the optimal level. It would be a complete travesty if P5P disappears from the market as pyridoxamine did. The attempt to ban folate is being done differently, through a proposed FDA rule, which carries the full force of law. So it’s critical that we stop this now. All of these attacks on your access to B vitamins are scandalous.
Natural vitamins belong in food and supplements. Banning them in order to potentially benefit drug companies is just another egregious example of the crony capitalism that infests the FDA. Please take immediate, urgent action on this. It may have to go to court. In the meantime, we lay the groundwork for court action by sending our complaints to the FDA. We need a lot of responses on this one to get the agency’s attention. URGENT Action Alert! The FDA must not be allowed to implement this change in its Supplement Facts rules.
It will in effect ban folate and allow supplement producers to use only synthetic folic acid. Consumers who are less able to convert folic acid to the safe and bioavailable folate we need will have no choice. For women of childbearing age, folate is recommended by the CDC, WHO, and most practitioners as an essential tool in preventing neural tube defects — and supplementation with folate is vital, since women may not be able to get enough folate in their diet. Send your message to the FDA today, and tell them not to convert a critical, natural B vitamin from a supplement to a drug through bureaucratic labeling sleight-of-hand!

California restaurant 'proudly' serves Popeyes chicken as its own, charges $13
A popular Long Beach, Calif., breakfast spot has found itself in the middle of a fried chicken controversy after a Yelp reviewer attacked the restaurant for using Popeyes chicken and passing it off as their own.
Sweet Dixie Kitchen, a small restaurant specializing in comfort food with a Southern influence, was called outby Yelp userTyler H., of Los Angeles, who claimed in his review, “Before my friends and I got seated [at the restaurant] we saw them quickly bring in two large boxes of Popeyes to the kitchen.”
Once seated, Tyler H. ordered fried chicken and waffles that he said tasted “suspiciously like Popeyes.”
“I kindly asked our waiter how they cooked their fried chicken. After checking he admitted that they do in fact use Popeyes,” Tyler H. continued in his review. “The manager compensated us for the entire meal.”
Sweet Dixie Kitchen owner Kim Sanchez saw the Yelp review and responded, boldly defending the origins of her chicken.
“We PROUDLY SERVE Popeyes' spicy tenders — the best fried chicken anywhere and from New Orleans — which are delivered twice a day. We also in case you need to know buy our gumbo from a friend who sells it at a local farmers market,” Sanchez said in her response.
“We promote usually small batch local producers in our menu. The exception is Popeyes – we can’t fry at this location – and it the fried chicken I love so much and I ate a ton of it in the ATL. So I serve it,” she continued.
Sanchez’s Yelp response also added that they “don’t mill our own flour” or “grow our own veggies.”
In an interview with Fox News, Sanchez said that she started using Popeyes two months ago for two new dishes – fried chicken and waffles and their fried chicken sandwich.
“I tried Costco chicken, I tried Restaurant Depot chicken, and then I went to dinner at Popeyes and knew this was the chicken we had to use for the store. It’s the best chicken,” she says.
Sanchez claims that she has always been upfront with the use of the chicken chain’s spicy fried chicken strips.
“We wrote it on our board in the restaurant, ‘Imported from Louisiana this week, thank you Popeyes.’ It wasn’t a secret. We use the chicken as an ingredient in a menu item we made, we don’t use their sauces or anything else.”
But other customers that learned about the questionable chicken sourcing have felt duped and took to Yelp to vent their frustrations.
“I just can'twit them. I want to see the contract between this restaurant & Popeyes to know what percentage of $$ Popeyes is getting from this restaurant to be so proudly serving their chicken,” another user, Agnes J. said.
However, despite the complaints rolling in, Sanchez has doubled down on her decision to outsource the restaurant’s fried chicken in a long ranton Facebookdetailing where the brunch outpost gets its ingredients.
The restaurant is open about making “roughly 95 percent” of the food they sell in house, like the seasoned potato salad and eggy quiche — the caveat being that the quiche, where they “crack each egg and measure spices and cream,” is then poured into a “pie crust that was made elsewhere.”

Sanchez said to Fox News that she has reached out to the franchise owner of the Popeyes where she gets her chicken to try and create a partnership, but has not heard back yet.
“I would be glad to put Popeyes on my menu. I walk in through the front door carrying the bag of chicken. The customers know where it’s from. Popeyes knows.”
Sanchez said going forward she will continue to sell the chicken on her menu and vows that she will continue the business “the same way we have always done — honest that we make nearly all from scratch.”

"Hair loss, receding hairline and bald patches are issues that affect many people. In case you are dealing with one of them there is no need to worry. These issues can be successfully treated with the help of natural remedies. Instead of worrying and losing your confidence, keep reading to learn about the fantastic solution that we are going to explain below. This remedy may not seem that appealing at first, but once you start noticing the results you will fall in love with it. The main ingredient of this remedy is onion juice.
Onion juice for hair growth
Onion is most commonly used for cooking but also as a natural remedy for numerous health issues. Onions contain sulfur, a mineral that is the main hair building block. They also improve blood circulation to the hair follicles which provides the proper nourishment. Onion juice has powerful anti-bacterial properties which make it great for treating scalp infections that could cause hair loss. Moreover, onions can even prevent premature hair graying due to the high amounts of the enzyme called catalase. All these reasons are more than enough to convince you to try onion juice right now. We are going to explain two ways you can use onion juice for promoting hair growth and even for growing thicker eyebrows.
Onion juice – scalp soaking solution
You need:
1 large onion
A grater, blender or a juicer
A strainer
Procedure:
Peel of the outer layers of the onion and wash it well. Chop it into smaller pieces and then blend it. If you want to grate it use the finest side, but note that using a juicer is the easiest way to prepare the onion juice. Then place the onion pulp in the strainer and squeeze until you get as much juice as possible. Apply the juice on your scalp and hair and massage it in. You should leave it act for about 30-45 minutes before washing off with a shampoo. You should repeat 1-2 times a week.
Onion juice – after wash solution
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon of onion juice
1 liter of warm water
Procedure:
Mix the onion juice with the water and then use the mixture to rinse your hair after shampooing it. You should repeat this procedure every other day.
Note: The onion odor will remain in your hair until you shampoo it. This is why it is advised to use the rinse at night or during the weekend.

"COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) — Even as Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers enjoyed his bye week at home last week, he couldn't resist the urge to get a sneak peek at his next opponent.
What Rivers saw from the Jacksonville Jaguars on film and will see this Sunday is a defensive front that will threaten the pass protection he has enjoyed through the first half of the season.
The Chargers have allowed 11 sacks through eight games, which is tied with the Jaguars for seventh-best in the NFL. Rivers has the most attempts of any quarterback in that top seven.
""I think we're on one of the best paces from a sacks and hits-wise that we have been on in some time,"" Rivers said Wednesday. ""Those guys up front have been great, so obviously need to continue that.""
Jacksonville's defense has a league-leading 35 sacks, with 10-sack games against the Indianapolis Colts and Houston Texans. Four Jaguars defenders have at least four sacks, led by Calaias Campbell's career-high 11 in his first season for Jacksonville.
There is nothing fancy about how the Jaguars create pressure. They ask their four defensive linemen to get after the quarterback while the other seven defenders drop into coverage.
""There's not a lot to what they do, and I don't say that in any way negative. They do it very, very well, and it's super challenging,"" Rivers said. ""Everything has got to be even more precise because of how sound they are on defense.""
That approach makes pass protection a comprehensive effort. Wide receivers have to get open and Rivers has to get the ball out quickly. Screen passes and draws can make the defensive line hesitate when Rivers does drop back to pass. A consistent run game is necessary to avoid third-and-long situations where the Jaguars can turn to their specialized rush packages.
""Well, we faced a couple teams like that this year. Denver is pretty good at it, and so is Kansas City, so you kind of have a plan that you try to work with. It's tough,"" offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt said.
But there are limits to how much the game plan can be tweaked to neutralize that pressure, especially for an offense trying to get into a rhythm. The Chargers have only scored 21 or more points in four games after averaging 25.6 points per game last season.
Rivers sees an offense that is close breaking out. Given his track record against Jacksonville, having thrown for 12 touchdowns and no interceptions in four wins against the Jaguars over the last four seasons, Rivers believes the turning point could be this week, provided the pass protection holds up.
""We've done enough good things to where I think we have a confident group,"" Rivers said. ""We know we're just scratching the surface. We're still just not scoring the points that we're used to scoring, and if we can get it going how we know and we start scoring 25, 28, 31, then you're going to win more than you lose.""
NOTES: Denzel Perryman will play weakside linebacker as he makes his season debut this week, with Hayes Pullard remaining at middle linebacker, head coach Anthony Lynn said Wednesday. Perryman was the projected starter at middle linebacker before undergoing surgery in August to repair a torn ligament in his ankle.

"Gary Barlow has invited a nine-year-old fan and his mother to his concert after the boy wrote to him saying he could not get a ticket.
Zachary Simmons mother Samantha was 164th in the queue when 6,500 tickets went on sale on the Eden Sessions website, but they sold out in minutes.
In the letter, Zachary said he was angry people bought tickets just to sell them for a profit.
""When Zak found out he could go, he burst into tears,"" Ms Simmons said.
Ms Simmons, from Redruth, Cornwall, said her son wrote the letter because he wanted to tell the singer that genuine fans were missing out.
""I was upset at not getting the tickets, which were to be part of Zak's Christmas present, but I was even more upset at having to tell him,"" she added.
""He was upset, but when I explained why we didn't get the tickets, he got angry and frustrated and said it was wrong that real fans were missing out.""
After Ms Simmons posted Zachary's letter on social media, where it was shared a number of times, Barlow tweeted: ""I'd love this young man and his mum to be my personal guests for the show.""
""We really weren't expecting that reply, because he must get this all day, every day,"" Ms Simmons said.
Zachary said he was ""thrilled"" that he can go to the concert in June, but he still wants the system to be changed so it is fair and fans do not suffer.
The Eden Sessions said there had been a ""massive"" demand for Barlow tickets at what was a ""relatively small venue"".
It said tickets sold out as quickly as any sold to date and the unprecedented demand meant that even people high up in the queue were not successful.
""In light of the feedback we are looking at ways to make our 'all tickets sold' messaging on our booking system faster and clearer in future,"" a statement added.",0

"According to information obtained via a lawsuit, the CIA and Pentagon have tirelessly worked behind the scenes to influence 2,000 Hollywood produced TV shows and movies.
Information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) shows that movies such asTransformers, James Bond, Hulk (2003), Top Gun, Act of Valor, Zero Dark Thirty, and TV shows like Hawaii Five-O, America’s Got Talent, Oprah, Jay Leno, Cupcake Wars, documentaries by the PBS, the History Channel, and even the BBC, have all been heavily by the CIA and the Pentagon.
Veteranstoday.com reports:That is quite a huge number. Researchers, scholars and writers of various stripes have known for years that the US government has been penetrating the film industry for years, but investigators were completely shocked to realize that it was a lot more than they previously thought.
Movies likeTransformers,James Bond,Hulk(2003),Top Gun,Act of Valor,Zero Dark Thirty, and TV shows likeHawaii Five-O,America’s Got Talent,Oprah,Jay Leno,Cupcake Wars, documentaries by the PBS, the History Channel, and even theBBC, have all been influenced by the CIA and the Pentagon. Listen to this:
“National Security Cinemaalso revealshow dozens of films and TV shows have been supported and influenced by the CIA, including the James Bond adventure Thunderball, the Tom Clancy thrillerPatriot Gamesand more recent films, includingMeet the ParentsandSalt…
“When a writer or producer approaches the Pentagon and asks for access to military assets to help make their film, they have to submit their script to the entertainment liaison offices for vetting. Ultimately, the man with the final say is Phil Strub, the Department of Defense’s (DOD) chief Hollywood liaison….
“If there are characters, action or dialogue that the DOD don’t approve of then the film-maker has to make changes to accommodate the military’s demands. If they refuse then the Pentagon packs up its toys and goes home. To obtain full cooperation the producers have to sign contracts—Production Assistance Agreements—which lock them into using a military-approved version of the script…
“On set at Edwards Air Force base during the filming of Iron Man, there was an angry confrontation between Strub and director Jon Favreau.”
Why are the Pentagon and the CIA using film to influence the masses? Simple: “This idea of using cinema to pin the blame for problems on isolated rogue agents or bad apples, thus avoiding any notion of systemic, institutional or criminal responsibility, is right out of the CIA/DOD’s playbook.”
Who are the victims in nearly all these movies? Who are the terrorists? The Palestinians and the Arabs. In fact, movies likeIron Manare part of a Jewish concept known as the golem. In Jewish folklore, agolemis a Frankensteinian monster brought to life to strike out at all perceived enemies of the Jewish people. TheNew Jewish Encyclopediadeclares that this inanimate character can be
“given artificial life with the aid of magic or the use of a Divine name…The concept of the Golem as an artificially created human being by supernatural means was widely accepted during the Middle Ages.
“According to the legend, the most famous Golem was created in the 16th century by Judah Low of Prague, one of the great rabbis. The express purpose of these living automatons was to protect the Jews from menacing dangers…Jewish folklore has numerous Golem stories, and several modern literary works have been written on that theme.”
Jewish professor Alon Raab tells us that “the Golem never failed to come to the rescue of his people when danger lurked, battling everyone from Yasser Arafat to space invaders.”Eleventh-century Talmudic scholar Rashi taught that
“the golem was created by combining the letters of God’s name as revealed in theSefer Yetzira[Book of Creation] a seminal kabbalistic text written between the third and sixth centuries C. E.”
This theme of the golem wreaking havoc on all enemies has emboldened Frank Miller and other comic book writers to provoke anything they perceive as a threat to the Jewish people. Journalist Geoff Boucher writes,
“Much has been made of Miller’s politics in the wake of ‘300.’ The deliriously violent and stylized sword film is based on a Spartan battle in 480 B. C., and although Miller wrote and drew the story for Dark Horse comics a decade ago, in film form it was received by many as a grotesque parody of the ancient Persians and a fetish piece for a war on Islam. Miller scoffs at these notions. ‘I think it’s ridiculous that we set aside certain groups and say that we can’t risk offending their ancestors. Please.’”
Miller sees Islam as a threat to the West, one that is not contingent upon Jewish provocation, and thinks that using his graphic skills to make fun of Islam is appropriate. Sure. But what if people treated Judaism and the Talmud the same way? Would Miller feel so cavalier then?
I don’t think so; there would be a loud outcry about anti-Semitism. Can Miller explain this phenomenon? If he does not agree with Talmudic teachings, then why doesn’t he devote equal amounts of time to ridiculing Talmudic ideology? The simple fact is that Miller’s work, like that of Stan Lee, Bob Kane, Joe Shuster, and others, is essentially Talmudic.
Miller’s dedication to taking down anything he sees as a threat to his essentially Talmudic worldview is revealed throughout his work, especially in his graphic novelSin City, which he brought to the big screen in 2005 in collaboration with Robert Rodriguez (director ofEl MariachiandDesperado) and Quentin Tarantino.
Both the book and the movie are laden with nudity, pornography, and pervasive, graphic violence. Miller himself talks about “a clash of civilization” and how “superheroes should be front and center.” He even believes that Jewish comic book writers like himself should use their medium as “the biggest megaphone” and blatantly states, “I am out to provoke.”
What Miller is implicitly saying here is that comic books are weapons that can be used to attack the moral order. And Miller has been using comic books for quite a long time. Miller issued a call to his brethren and fellow writers by saying: “Let’s revive our tradition and get back on the job.”
Well, Miller has been doing exactly that recently. He has a comic book coming out in September entitled,Dark Night: The Master Race. It seems like he couldn’t expunge the “master race” idea from his mind, a theme that has been a central focus in Talmudic teachings for centuries.
Miller describes his new comic bookHoly Terror: Batman!as “a piece of propaganda.” For Miller, the logic here seems to be simple: revolutionary ideas lead to graphic novels; graphic novels lead to movies; movies lead to propaganda; and propaganda invariably leads to the weakening of the moral and social order. As Eli Roth later puts it, his movies are going to “fuck up an entire generation.”
What if an entire generation doesn’t want to be “fucked”? Well, they are going to find themselves squaring off with people like Roth and indeed Miller.",1
"They say there’s only two things constant in this life: death and taxes. But a third viable contender might be cancer, which an extensive cohort of scientific research has found is caused by prolonged exposure to radiation from cell phones and their associated communication towers.
Contrary to what you may have heard in the mainstream news, mobile phones and the antennas that allow them to communicate emit powerful, microwave radio frequencies capable of penetrating our bodies and cells. And constant exposure to these frequencies, according to the science, appears to be one of the leading causes of cancer in the modern age.
Extensive research into the connection between cell phone radiation and cancer has linked this ubiquitous modern technology to two main types of brain tumors: gliomas and acoustic neuromas. Information compiled by the ElectricSense.com has confirmed the following findings with regard to cell phones and brain cancer.
1) An independent study commissioned by U. S. wireless carrier T-Mobile found that cell phone radiation directly initiates and promotes the formation of cancer:
2) The renowned Interphone study also found that regular cell phone use at just 30 minutes per day over 10 years increases the risk of gliomas by 40 percent. It also found that tumors were more likely to form on the side of the head where a cell phone is most prominently held:
BioInitiative.org.[PDF]
3) A review of 23 epidemiological studies conducted by seven scientists concluded that cell phones cause a “harmful association” between cell phones and cancer. The only included studies that didn’t suggest this were “lower quality” ones that researchers say “failed to meet scientific best practices” — these studies were all funded by the mobile phone industry:
NCBI. NLM.NIH.gov;
SFGate.com.
4) Researchers from the Hardell Research Group, which is noted for conducting what many consider to be the highest-quality studies on the subject, found a “consistent pattern” of increased risks for both glioma and acoustic neuroma in conjunction with mobile phone use:
PathophysiologyJournal.com.
5) A study out of France observed similar outcomes associated with prolonged exposure to electromagnetic frequencies from mobile phones. Scientists noted higher rates of gliomas and temporal tumors from “occupational and urban mobile phone use.” In response, the EMF watchdog group Powerwatch noted that this study supports the categorization of mobile phone radiation as a “probable human carcinogen.”
OEM. BMJ.com;
Powerwatch.org.uk.
6) A study of nearly 800,000 middle-aged UK women found that those who used cell phones for 10 years or more had a 250 percent increased risk of developing an acoustic neuroma. The longer the women used the phones, the higher their risk:
SaferEMR.com.
7) Similarly, a study conducted by the group Lonn found that acoustic neuromas are increasingly more likely to develop the longer a person uses a mobile phone:
NCBI. NLM.NIH.gov.
8) In Sweden, researchers studying adult brain tumor cases found that individuals with the highest cumulative use of mobile phones also had the highest risk of developing brain cancer:
NCBI. NLM.NIH.gov.
9) The Hardell group conducted a study in 2009 which found that RF-EMFs from mobile and cordless phones are directly associated with malignant brain tumors. This study specifically states that wireless radiation initiates and promotes carcinogenesis:
NCBI. NLM.NIH.gov.
1) The body’s “master” gland, also known as the pituitary gland, is responsible for producing hormones and regulating other key bodily systems. But a study out of France found that cell phone use greatly increases the risk that this important gland will become cancerous:
MieuxPrevenir. Blogspot.fr.
2) The thyroid gland, which similarly produces hormones in addition to regulating body temperature, is also affected by mobile phone radiation. An Israeli study found that rates of cell phone use are directly proportional to the risk of developing thyroid gland cancer:
SaferEMR.com.
3) Many health experts would contend that solar radiation poses the greatest threat to healthy skin. But a study out of Sweden found that melanoma risk is greatly accelerated by mobile phone use.
4) A controversial Powerwatch study found that cell phone use nearly triples the risk of neuroepithelial tumors, which are a result of stem cell cancer:
Powerwatch.org.uk.
5) Another study out of Israel confirmed a direct association between cell phone use and cancers of the mouth. Based on 460 cases of parotid gland tumors, researchers observed a direct association between mobile phone radiation and cancers of the parotid, the salivary gland located right next to where users typically hold their phones:
AJE. OxfordJournals.org.
6) A separate study, also out of Israel, found that parotid gland cancers have increased in prevalence by 400 percent in the country between 1970 and 2006, which scientists link to increased mobile phone use:
Journals. LWW.com.
7) An extensive review of more than 12 separate studies looking at health outcomes from exposure to radiation from mobile phone, television and radio broadcast towers found that cancers in general, and specifically cancers of the brain and blood (leukemia), are greatly increased:
Journals. LWW.com.
8) Lymph nodes, a key component of the immune system, don’t like cell phone radiation much, either. An Australian study found that typical exposure to cell phone radiation greatly increases lymphoma risk:
MicrowaveNews.com.[PDF]
9) Back in the U. S., a study looking at young women with breast cancer found that regular use of smartphones can trigger the formation of breast cancer. This is especially true when women carry their phones in their blouses or bras, where phones are pressed directly against the breasts.
Hindawi.com.
10) Researchers in Germany have also linked mobile phone radiation to uveal melanoma and other cancers of the eye:
NCBI. NLM.NIH.gov.
11) Practically every other type of cancer not covered by one of the aforementioned studies was identified in a large-scale Brazilian study, which linked mobile phone radiation to cancers of the prostate, breasts, lungs, kidneys and liver. Shockingly, more than 80 percent of identified deaths in Brazil’s third largest city, Belo Horizonte, occurred less than 500 meters away from one of the city’s 300 cell phone antennas:

"There was a time when buyers measured the appeal of a vehicle based on such things as styling, performance or the availability of features like power windows and leather seats. But these days, shoppers are seeking out the vehicles that offer the most seamless and powerful digital technologies.
Next month, BMW will launch its new Connected Plus service, an update in an expanding line-up of digital features and services that have been added to the Bavarian maker's cars in recent years. The new system will not only help you plot out the best route to your destination but use real-time traffic reports to give you a heads-up when it’s time to leave. Still running late? It will send out an alert to the folks you’re meeting to let them know when they can expect you to arrive.
BMW is by no means the only maker racing to introduce such high-tech features into your car, truck or crossover. Ford, for example, now lets you access Amazon’s Alexa with a tap of a button on the steering wheel. Among other things, you can use that digital voice assistant to have your favorite beverage waiting at Starbucks for your morning commute.

“We think our cars need to play well with the digital lifestyle owners choose,” Tom Brenner, head of BMW’s digital services, told NBC News during a tour of the company’s technology center in downtown Chicago.
The facility more closely represents what you’d expect to find in Silicon Valley than a typical automotive development center. Filled with young, latte-drinking cyber-geeks, it works at a pace that sees new products, services — and updates of existing software — roll out, on average, every two weeks. Consider that the average BMW vehicle has a life cycle of about six to seven years, with only a modest update halfway through.
BMW’s intense focus on digital technology might seem an oxymoron considering the brand’s long-running advertising tagline, “The Ultimate Driving Machine.” But Brenner and other company officials say there should be no surprise. Why, they ask, would you expect that the typical American’s increasingly digital lifestyle be interrupted once they slip behind the steering wheel?

BMW began its foray into technology with the launch of the 2001 7-Series. Its flagship sedan introduced the concept of an iDrive, a sort of mobile mouse that controlled an array of onboard functions, including navigation, audio and climate control. The list of features built into today’s cars has rapidly escalated, especially with the debut of driver assistance technologies like Blind Spot Detection, as well as the addition of hands-free Bluetooth phone and audio pairing.
""The new asset in the automotive business is data.""
BMW Connected Plus will go several steps further. It tracks appointments in an owner’s calendar and, if there is driving involved, it calculates not only driving time but how long it might take to walk to your car and then help you find where to park. You’ll get an alert 10 minutes before you should leave to give you time to get ready.
You can then ask your Alexa device to turn the car on and, on the sort of sweltering summer day that Chicagoans faced this week, turn on the air conditioning.
There are plenty of other services coming, including the ability to access e-mail on your Microsoft Exchange server, even dictating a voice reply.
Such functions are likely to become even more desirable in the years to come, explained Brenner. According to various studies by organizations like the Boston Consulting Group, one-third or more of the miles Americans travel by 2030 are likely to be in driverless automobiles. That will provide plenty of time to watch “content,” Brenner said, work, or catch up on some sleep.

“It takes only a little imagination” to think about all the possible services and features that will migrate into the automobile in the coming years,” Gerri Martin-Flickinger, the chief technology officer for Starbucks, said during a joint news conference with Ford last March.
Meanwhile, auto manufacturers are racing to pair your car with all the digital devices in your life. Chevrolet on Friday announced owners can operate the MyChevrolet app through their Apple watches to lock or unlock a vehicle, find directions to where it was parked or sound the horn.
One of the challenges will be to add new functionality to vehicles already on the road. Tesla has addressed that by incorporating over-the-air, or OTA, updates that can be used to install new services, replace old software — or even diagnose vehicle problems. Honda launched OTA capabilities with its new Odyssey minivan, and BMW is working on similar technology for Connected Plus.
It’s difficult to find an automaker that isn’t working on in-car technologies, and they’re partnering with the obvious list of major Silicon Valley and other tech companies: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, as well as major restaurant chains, digital service providers, and an endless list of smaller tech firms and start-ups.
Some manufacturers are offering their services at no charge — at least for an initial period that can run from one to three years. But all are looking for the right business equation. General Motors has developed a steady revenue stream from its OnStar service, with an à la carte menu of safety, convenience and service features.
There’s another pay-off. BMW believes it can boost its loyalty rates — measured in returning customers — by several percent, “which is worth millions of dollars,” explained Dieter May, the head of digital products and services. That’s on top of potential revenue streams from various paid services.
Yet as with other access points to the connected world, there is a potential downside.
“Data is becoming a currency, with actual value, and it must be protected,"" Danny Le, principal and automotive leader, at KPMG, told NBC News. ""Security needs to be invested in.”
In-car technology is the single biggest source of complaints about today’s vehicles.
Indeed, the threat of hacking has become an all-consuming conversation within the automotive digital community, as it has throughout the tech world.
There are other risks. BMW took a lot of heat early on for the cumbersome operation of the original iDrive. Only with recent iterations have consumers given strongly positive reviews. Ford was similarly thrashed for problems with its early Sync in-car system. According to David Sargent, head of automotive practice at J. D. Power and Associates, in-car technology is the single biggest source of complaints about today’s vehicles.

"A landmark studyhelps explain why Big Pharma is so afraid of the medical benefits of cannabis. The pharmaceutical and alcohol industries, both powerful influences in Washington, have long lobbied against cannabis legalization in order to protect their profits.
The recent study is lending credibility to the idea that medical cannabis can be used as a natural alternative to prescription pain medications, with nearly 100 percent of respondents saying they believe cannabis is helping them decrease their use of prescription opioids to treat the pain.
The study, which was conducted by HelloMD, one of the largest medical cannabis communities in the nation, and University of California Berkley, surveyed nearly 3,000 patients who use both opioid and non-opioid based pain medication.
The results of the study concluded that 97 percent of respondents “strongly agreed/agreed” that they could decrease use of their opioid medications when using cannabis. While 92 percent of respondents said that they “strongly agreed/agreed” that they prefer cannabis to treat their medical condition.
The study also found that 81 percent of respondents said they “strongly agreed/ agreed” that using cannabis alone was more effective than taking cannabis with opioids.
Use of cannabis as a substitute/in conjunction with opioid-based pain medication (PRNewsfoto/HelloMD)
While cannabis is only legalized for medicinal use in 26 states and the District of Columbia, 93 percent of respondents said they “strongly agreed/agreed” that they would use cannabis as a substitute for their current prescription medication if it was available.
Dr.Perry Solomon, Chief Medical Officer of HelloMD, referenced a recent publication from the National Academy of Sciences,  on “The Health Effect of Cannabis and Cannabinoids,” and noted that this study serves as a way to support the theory that cannabis is the opposite of a gateway drug.
“Thelatest publicationfrom the National Academy of Sciences clearlyrefuted the ‘gateway drug’ theory that using marijuana can lead to opioid addiction, instead finding evidence of cannabis having multiple curative benefits,” Dr.Solomon said. “Our study further substantiates this.Hopefully this will awaken the public, medical professionals and legislatures to the fact that cannabis is a safe, non-addictive product, available to help fight the opioid epidemic.”
Amanda Reiman, a professor at UC Berkley who helped lead the study, said the treatment of pain has become a “politicized business” inthe United States that has resulted in “the rapidly rising rate of opioid related overdoses and dependence.”
“Cannabis has been used throughout the world for thousands of years to treat pain and other physical and mental health conditions,” Reiman said. “Patients have been telling us for decades that this practice is producing better outcomes than the use of opioid based medications. It’s past time for the medical profession to get over their reefer madness and start working with the medical cannabis movement and industry to slow down the destruction being caused by the over prescribing and overuse of opioids.”
As  has reported, despite the fact that cannabis has been proven to help with a number of things from killing cancer cells to treating rare and fatal conditions, it is still classified among the deadliest drugs that are supposed to have no medicinal value in the United States.
While studies such as the latest one from HelloMD and UC Berkley serve as a reminder that for many patients, cannabis is the ideal alternative to opioid medications, there is still a clear reason why cannabis has yet to be legalized in the U. S. If medical cannabis was legalized in all 50 states, it would take at least $4.5 billion away from the stranglehold that has been established by big pharma.

"AT&T is inching closer to bringing 5G to market.
AT&T (T, Tech30) announced Wednesday that it plans to begin testing its faster 5G network for streaming videos through DirecTV Now in Austin households.
The trial, expected to take place in the first half of 2017, will test how well the next-generation wireless network handles “heavy video traffic,” according to a company announcement.
AT&T says its 5G service has hit speeds of up to 14 gigabits per second in lab tests, significantly faster than the current 4G network. That would cut the delay for streaming or downloading movies and shows over a wireless connection. (Disclaimer: AT&T agreed in October to buy Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. The deal is pending approval by regulators.)
Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s CEO, said at the time of the acquisition he hopes to combine faster wireless service with premium content to compete “head to head with the cable companies.”
The 5G concept has been teased in the wireless industry for years as consumers look to stream more videos, connect more smart devices in their homes and experiment with virtual reality applications.
By making wireless speeds faster, companies like AT&T may get customers to use more data — and pay for it.
Verizon previously said it expects to begin rolling out 5G technology as soon as 2017. Google is now focusing on wireless too after attempting to bring high-speed Internet to customers through costly fiber optic cables.",1

Pope Francis recently declared Satan as the real God during a ceremony with Pope John Paul the 1st and Pope John Paul the 2nd.There have been lots of Youtube videos which claim that the Pope including a group of Catholics, including many Cardinals, are actually citing a prayer that clearly uses the word ‘Lucifer’.
Is this a conspiracy theory that merely the product of a simple mistranslation taken out of context? It’s strange to think that the Pope and the College of Cardinals are actually Satanists, but if you look at how the Pope continually facilitates the New World order agenda, it’s not really that far of the fetched.
The clues are right in front of you…The massive pedophilia epidemic isn’t coming from random members of the public who has suddenly decided they find children attractive, it comes from the Catholic Church, and no, it’s not just suddenly started, it’s been going on for millennia but is only just being uncovered.
Now, what could be more satanic than pedophilia?Pope Francis was also recently caught on the radio telling listeners that “Jesus turned into Satan”.
The religious leader accused Jesus of “debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself”, before adding Jesus Christ “made himself the devil, the serpent, for us.”
The Pope said a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.
‘Satan’s Been Misunderstood, Let’s Give Him A Chance’So what is the Pope’s game? His recent e heretical statement came after he broke centuries of Christian tradition by announcing to a 33,000 strong crowd of Catholics that
“a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.
“Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,” the pope said during the June 25 speech, reinforcing the theories that he is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy.
So what is with the Satanic Prayer the Pope has been reciting? The payer is called the Exsultet, prayed each year at the Easter Vigil to celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, here it is:
Latin
Flammas eius lúcifer matutínus invéniat: ille, inquam, lúcifer, qui nescit occásum. Christus Fílius tuus, qui, regréssus ab ínferis, humáno géneri serénus illúxit, et vivit et regnat in scula sculórum.
English
“His flame dawning his own son May, I say to you O’ Lucifer who knows no setting Christ is your son who came back from the dead and shed his light on the human race and is alive and reigns forever and ever.”
So why is the world Lucifer in a Catholic prayer? The Catholic church say that Lucifer means “light-bearer” (lux is “light,” as you may know from fiat lux, “let there be light”.So why do we use the word “Lucifer” as a personal name for Satan? And why is Christ called “Lucifer” in the Exultet?
“How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low! You said in your heart, ‘I will ascend to heaven; above the stars of God I will set my throne on high; I will sit on the mount of assembly in the far north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will make myself like the Most High.
’According to shamelesspopery: On its face, this is about the King of Babylon, but it’s not hard to see the subtext: that it’s also about the fall of Satan, who tried to hoist himself above the Lord God. This is made clearer in light of the New Testament, in which Christ says, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven” (Luke 10:18). And since the Latin Vulgate translates “Day Star” as “Lucifer,” it’s how that title for the devil came about.
But what about for Christ? Just look at Revelation 22:16,
“I Jesus have sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star.”
Interestingly, the Vulgate doesn’t use lucifer here, but stella splendida et matutina, but the meaning is the same. Both Jesus and the devil are referred to as morning stars. (The Protestant site GotQuestions notes this oddity, but also that it’s not unique: both are also compared to lions, cf. 1 Peter 5:8 and Rev. 5:5, etc.). In the broader Scriptural context, this makes sense.
Christ is the Light (John 1:4-9), humanity’s “dayspring” (Luke 1:78). As a fallen angel, Satan once bore witness to that light before turning to darkness. Ironically, Christ alone truly warrants being called a lucifer or “light-bearer”: the devil forfeited this by turning away from the light. But in a quirk of history, based largely on the Latin Vulgate (in language that the KJV borrowed), “Lucifer” became associated with the devil as a common name.
So there you go: the Exultet is an ancient prayer (likely dating back to at least the sixth century), back before we mistakenly started treating “Lucifer” as a proper name for the devil. Perhaps it’s not as exciting as a billion-person Satanist conspiracy, but it’s a lot truer.

"At five foot, six inches, Apotheosis was shorter than the average American male and very unhappy about it.
So he did something other men who feel short might consider unthinkable: he opted for costly, painful surgeries to make himself ""grow"" a total of six inches.
""I realized that the world looked at me a certain way that I didn't look at myself in that certain way,"" said the 37-year-old New Yorker, who goes by the pseudonym ""Apotheosis"" in online forums and asked that ""20/20"" not use his real name. ""I wanted the way I felt about myself and the way the world felt about me to be similar.""
Apotheosis is one of a ""growing"" number of men pursuing limb-lengthening procedures for cosmetic reasons.
Dr. Dror Paley, a renowned orthopaedic surgeon at the Paley Institute at St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., performed 650 leg-lengthening surgeries last year.
Most of Paley's patients have severe deformities or dwarfism, but he also sees cosmetic patients.
""The majority who come for cosmetic limb lengthening have what we call, height dysphoria. They're unhappy with their height,"" said Paley, adding that therapy has little effect on changing a patient's views. ""It's one of the few psychologic-psychiatric disorders that you can actually cure with the knife.""
That is precisely the reason why Akash Shukla, 25, decided to undergo the procedure. At age 18, the New Jersey man was devastated to find out that his final height would be 4'11 .
""I felt like my short stature was kind of causing a void inside me- an emptiness in my heart, if you will,"" he said.
And not everyone was encouraging.
""There are people that have said, 'just accept what God gave you. But, in some way, shape or form everybody is trying to alter what god gave them. If God gave kids crooked teeth, they get braces,"" said Shukla, who is now almost 5'2"" thanks to the surgery.
But limb lengthening is certainly not like straightening teeth.
Only a few doctors, including Paley, perform the procedure in the United States.
Surgeons break the leg bone in two and implant a state-of-the-art telescopic rod into the middle of the broken bones which then pulls the bone apart very slowly, about one millimeter a day.
New bone grows around it and tissues like the muscle, the nerves, the arteries, and the skin, regenerate as well.
At about $85,000, the procedure is expensive and the process lengthy. It takes at least three months to complete it and it requires demanding and excruciating physical therapy.
Apotheosis is still in recovery and he does not want to go public even though this is his second surgery. ""I am still lengthening right now and there could be further complications and I don't want to talk about it successfully until it's been successful.""
But he is candid about his leg lengthening journey on www.makemetaller.org, an online forum for people interested in the procedure.
""I am not telling anyone they should do this surgery, but I am laying out my experiences and the risks that I have taken and the successes that I have had and let people make their own decision,"" he said.
Many go to the site looking for advice on doctors, often foreign, as the cost for the surgery could be less than half as much overseas.
Apotheosis traveled to Germany to have internal rods implanted and now he is the one responsible for controlling the lengthening, twisting his legs back and forth to extend the rod inside.
Despite the pain and financial burden, patients like Apotheosis say those few more inches of height can make a big difference.
""When I walk down the street a different person perceived differently by the world for the rest of my life, you know, I am who I want to be now,"" he said.
He chose the moniker Apotheosis, he said, because ""it means to become godlike -- become the best you can be. It's a Greek word.""
""And that's kind of what I want? And I am not trying to be godlike; I am trying to be the best me that I can be.""

"As robots come to dominate manufacturing, and automation eats its way into more business processes, societies are beginning to address the future of work for humans. Another issue -- for the power industry in particular -- is whether programmable machines might also significantly increase electricity use.
In the wealthy countries of Asia, robots have already arrived. South Korea, Singapore and Japan are the three most automated manufacturing economies, according to the International Federation of Robotics. In Korea, 1 manufacturing worker in 21 is a robot. The U. S., Taiwan and five wealthy European countries fill out the top 10:
Since robots run on electricity, as do other automated processes for moving materials around the factory floor, an electric utility executive might reasonably hope that they will soon drive greater electricity demand. But a look at the past 10 years of electricity consumption in these top 10 countries suggests they might not.
Four countries on the list have increased their consumption since 2006 -- Korea's power use is up almost 40 percent and Singapore's is up 30 percent. But Taiwan's use is up only modestly. And the U. S., by far the largest electricity consumer in the group, is up by just 1 percent.
As for the European countries, every one has seen itselectricity consumption fall.
It’s not as if any of these countries are deindustrialized. Germany has a heavily industrial economy, and its producers are automating as much as possible. Siemens, for one, has boosted production at one factory ninefold in three decades without appreciably increasing its workforce. Yet, as a whole, Germany uses 5 percent less electricity than it did 10 years ago.
To be sure, this is correlation, not evidence, that increasing automation lowers energy use, and there are many other variables in the mix.
Where robots require significant electrical load, they create an economic incentive to conserve electricity elsewhere -- in lighting and heating, for example, which serve humans more than machines. The potential for near-total automation -- and with it the “lights-out factory” devoid of human labor -- would greatly reduce or eliminate the systems designed to keep people comfortable. In Google’s data centers, the temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) in the “cold aisle” sections where people work, and 120 degrees elsewhere. And the ambient noise is so loud, humans can't enter without ear protection. Continue the process of automation, and more energy-consuming systems disappear. No people means no refrigeration, no cooking, no TVs in the break room.
Every manufacturing company is looking for low to zero to negative growth in electricity use. So while intensive and pervasive industrial automation must be a tempting narrative for power company executives looking for new sources of demand, it's more likely that the robot era will arrive with no need for extra energy.

175 entries, no noticeable mistakes. Favourite clue (by far), among 16 receiving one or more votes, was 'Who'll render France lawful when it strays?' for FLIC. Equal second was 'Reynard's tail behind, brush-like' for DAFT, though I've a sneaking feeling I might have used the idea, if not the precise wording, before. (I never deliberately reuse an old clue verbatim, no matter how pleased I was with it first time round.) Another clue, which received a few votes of approval, was actually flawed: in 'Being so makes car drive off, instinctively' (IN SE) the final word should have been 'intrinsically', which I keyed incorrectly and then failed to spot the error at proof stage. A few of you clearly saw that something was amiss by querying my definition. I do apologize.
There were lots of good ideas, nicely realized, for a not very inspiring compound noun. Picking the best was uncommonly tricky. The three prizewinners I chose in the end on the naturalness of their wording, a factor always worth keeping in mind when composing your entries. The less a clue reads like a clue, i.e. something that would sound odd in any other context than that of a crossword, the better, I feel. A fair number of you dealt with the LESSON part as LESS ON. Nothing wrong with that, but too often it was clued by 'wearing fewer clothes' or something similar, which isn't quite right: 'wearing fewer clothes' leads to 'having less on'. Such fine syntactical distinctions are most important.
The comments I received on my question regarding my use of Mrs/Ms in slips, etc (for which many thanks) were overwhelmingly in favour of retaining the status quo. (The only time I don't use Mrs is for husband-and-wife teams, where logic would demand both Mr and Mrs, though this seems too pernickety.) There was also a universal welcome for my decision to accept all abbreviations in Chambers in future. I'm just sorry it's taken me so long! And yes, I'm also happy to accept the use of international radio communication code words such as alpha, bravo, etc.
While on the subject of Chambers, I've had the following update from the 'project editor': 'The situation with The Chambers Dictionary, 13th edition is that we can [sic] to reprint it later this year, although we do not have a set date for this yet. It would not be cost effective to pulp our current stock and to reprint the book just yet so our next reprint will be based on shifting our current stock. We do have the missing words list available on the Chambers website as a printable PDF for those who have purchased the 13th edition.' This strikes me as pretty outrageous and I shall say so. If you feel like complaining direct to the publishers, please do. Meanwhile I shall continue to recommend the new edition, but this should not inconvenience those who have not yet bought it.",0
"Do you have a few favorite “go-to” herbs? Why not grow them in water and keep them close at hand on the kitchen window sill or right on the counter? Water-grown herbs are just as flavorsome as those you grow in the garden. You don’t have to mess with soil or worry about regular watering or changing seasons.
Most herbs will be happy growing in water, but those propagated from cuttings are easier to start in water. Seed-grown annuals like cilantro, mustard, and dill are a bit tricky because you need to sow the seeds in soil or some other medium and then transfer the seedlings to water. Soil to water transition is not impossible, but it may not always work out because soil-grown roots are a bit different from water roots.
What You Need to Grow Herbs in Water Water
For a simple herb stand in the kitchen, you can root herb cuttings in plain water in glass bottles. Avoid using chlorinated water directly as the bleaching chemical is not exactly friendly to plant tissues. Tap water that has been left to air overnight is fine, so is stored rainwater. Spring water or well water is the best because it has some amount of dissolved minerals that may be of use to plants.
Containers
As for the container, mason jars or any other glass bottles will do, even plastic bottles. Roots generally like to grow away from light, so colored bottles, especially amber colored ones (such as these) are best. You can just wrap a piece of paper around the bottle to keep the root zone in the dark. This will even prevent algal growth on the container walls and on the root surface. Algae do not adversely affect plant growth, but they make the bottles look untidy.
Narrow-mouthed containers have an advantage: they can support the cuttings and keep them nearly upright. However, the mouth of the container shouldn’t be too narrow or tight-fitting around the cutting. The roots have to breathe, and the mouth of the container should allow free movement of air.
If you’re using a wide-mouthed container, you have the option of covering the top with nylon or wire netting. Insert the cuttings through the holes, and that will offer some support to the cuttings. Another advantage, especially in warmer areas, is that the netting prevents mosquitoes from laying eggs in the water and multiplying.
Plant cuttings
Soft cuttings are pretty quick to root in water. You don’t need to use any rooting hormones. If you have some herbs growing in the garden, snip off 6-inch sections from growing tips and put them in the water-filled containers. The best part of growing herbs from cuttings is that you can use the ones you get from the supermarket. Just wash them in plain water and cut off the lower portion.
Remove lower leaves from cuttings and trim the lower tips close to the nodes from where the roots arise. When they are inserted into the bottles, there shouldn’t be any leaves touching the water. They can rot easily and spoil the water, as they do in flower vases.
Woody cuttings like rosemary may take longer to root, so be patient. Change the water once a week without disturbing the cuttings. Once the roots start growing, usually between 2-6 weeks, water changes may not be necessary.
If you have willow trees in the garden, you can steep some branches in warm water overnight to make a natural rooting hormone mix. Place the cuttings in the infusion to encourage rooting. Alternately, rooting hormone powder can be used.
10 Best Herbs You Can Grow In Water
1. Peppermint – This is the most popular mint for medicinal uses because it contains high amounts of the volatile substance menthol. It gives a unique cooling sensation on the skin or tongue, but without actually causing any temperature variation. Growing peppermint in water is easy; just put fresh cuttings in water to grow new plants.
2. Spearmint – This is another mint variety closely related to peppermint. In fact, peppermint is a natural hybrid of spearmint and an aquatic mint that is commonly known as water mint.
3. Oregano – This pungent herb is worth growing indoors because you can use the leaves to flavor almost any vegetable. Take cuttings of fresh growth and pot them up in water. Start pinching the growing tips as soon as the plant starts to grow well.
4. Basil – Basil would love the warmth of your kitchen and grow happily in a water-filled container as long as you provide it good light. Take cuttings any time before it starts flowering. If you have several varieties of basil, growing cuttings in water is the best way to preserve your collection during winter.
5. Sage – Take soft cuttings in the spring and root them in water. You may need only one or two sage plantsbecause only very tiny amounts are needed to impart flavor. Keep the plants in bright light and in a well-aerated place because this herb is prone to mildew.
6. Stevia – This sweet plant is good to have in the house to add to freshly brewed teas and beverages. Take cuttings of actively growing soft branches and place them in water. Provide a warm place and as much light as possible to keep this tropical plant happy and full of sweetness.
7. Lemon balm – The lemony scent of this mint-family herb is a welcome treat in any home, especially in the winter. The leaves are great for making tea. Take cuttings in spring or fall. Keep the containers in a warm place that receives plenty of bright indirect light. They may take up to 3-4 weeks to develop roots. Keep the water clean with regular changes. Some people find it easier to root the cuttings outside the house when the weather’s still warm. It may help avoid white mildew that lemon balm is prone to. You can bring them indoors when the new plants are well established.
8. Tarragon – Take cuttings in the spring after new growth appears. Fall cuttings are fine too, but they may take longer to grow roots. Keep cuttings in a warm place that gets bright light. French tarragon is best as a culinary herb. Russian tarragon is milder, or even bland, so use it as a green in salads.
9. Thyme – You need to take cuttings of new growth that is green in color. The old growth that has become stiff and brown may not sprout roots easily. The best time to take the cuttings is mid-spring to early summer, before the plant starts flowering. The thin stems of thyme can dry out very fast, so put them in water as soon as you cut them. Spray the portion above the water, if necessary. Once it starts growing, cut the stems to promote branching.
10. Rosemary – The semi-woody cuttings of rosemary take longer to root, but spring cuttings of new shoots may be faster. Either way, it is worth the effort because rosemary makes an excellent indoor plant for a sunny spot.
6 Veggies & 9 Houseplants You Can Also Grow In Water
9 Best Houseplants To Grow In Water
Not just herbs, but other houseplants do equally well in water. Just perfect for you if you regularly kill houseplants by over watering them or forgetting to water altogether. You don’t need to make any special arrangements when you go off for a few days.
Pothos – This plant is commonly grown in water. Take tip cuttings of any length and put the cut end into some water making sure that 2-3 nodes are submerged in water.
Arrowhead –  This plant is similar to pothos. Tip cuttings can be potted up with a few nodes below the water level.
Philodendrons – Dainty heart-leaved philodendrons, as well as the large, split-leaved types do equally well in water. Take 6-8 inch cuttings of growing tips and put in a container that can support its weight. You may need to place a piece of rock in the container to prevent accidental tipping.
Peace lily – You can pot up divisions or use an entire plant growing in a pot. Just wash off all the soil from the roots and put it in a bowl of water.
Aluminum plant – Cuttings of this beautiful plant with silver markings do very well in water.
Dracena – The plant commonly grown in water as Chinese lucky bamboo incidentally is no bamboo, but a variety of dracaena (Dracaena braunii). Others like corn plant (D. fragrans), Song of India (D. reflexa) are good choices. Sections of the cane can be rooted and grown in water, but support is essential for these top heavy plants.
Dieffenbachia (Dumb cane) – Cut top growth and pot up in water after the cut end becomes dry. Care must be taken while handling this plant; its sap is so caustic, it can burn your skin.
Chinese evergreen (Aglaonema) – Take cuttings or clean whole plants growing in pots and put them in large containers of water.
Chlorophytum (Spider plant, Airplane plant) – Put large plantlets or entire plants cleaned of all soil particles in goldfish bowls full of water. Water culture is best for hanging plants because you don’t need to water them often.
6 Best Vegetables To Grow In Water
Watercress, water chestnut, wasabi, and lotus are some of the food plants that naturally grow in water. But many terrestrial vegetables can adapt to growing in water. Some, like leafy greens like lettuce and spinach, do extremely well. They seem to be happier than their counterparts growing in the ground because they get a continuous supply of water and are not bothered by soil pathogens.
Lettuce – This is the most favorite vegetable of hydroponic farmers. The easiest way to grow them hydroponically is to start the seeds in netted cups. When they are bigger, insert them into the beds containing growing medium.
Spinach – This leafy vegetable is grown the same way as lettuce.
Tomatoes – Tomato seeds started in individual cups are inserted into the growing medium. High yields are typical of hydroponically cultivated tomatoes.
Peppers – Their cultural requirements are similar to tomatoes.
Cucumbers – Bush type cucumbers are preferred for hydroponics; the climbing type would need extra support.
Celery – Being able to grow celery without soil is a bonus; it means no dirt deposited in the leaf bases. It makes cleaning the vegetable very easy.
How To Feed Water-Grown Plants
Plants growing in plain water will soon exhaust what little mineral nutrients the water may contain. Since they don’t have access to the nutrients naturally occurring in soil, they need supplemental nutrition to do well. Regular fertilizers diluted in water or proprietary formulations designed for hydroponics can be used at regular intervals.
When you use fertilizers to feed water grown plants, they leave some residues that may accumulate in the water and on the roots, causing root burn. Change the water at regular intervals and flush the plants and the containers occasionally.
Hydroponics – Growing Plants in Water and Inert Media
Soil has some functions other than providing minerals required for plant growth,. It supports the plants and provides a medium for anchoring the roots. When plants are grown without soil, the lack of proper support can be a limiting factor. Soil acts as a reservoir of water and fertilizers added to it, and then releases both in a controlled manner.
Inert natural media like sand, gravel, perlite, vermiculite coconut fiber, and coconut chips are sometimes added to water containers to serve as support. Some products like lightweight expanded clay and rock wool are specially manufactured for this purpose.
Plants grown in a hydroponic medium seem to appreciate the physical support they get. Special nutrient formulations are mixed with water to provide continuous nourishment to the plants. That’s why hydroponic systems typically give very high yield.
Types of Hydroponic Systems
Wick system – The plants grow in tubs filled with an absorbent medium like coco-peat that can wick up nutrient-rich water from a bottom reservoir. It is somewhat like growing plants in soil, except that the nutrients come from the water, not the medium.
Deep Water Culture – It is almost same as the simple system described for growing plants directly in containers of water. The roots remain suspended in water, but the plants are actually growing in another container partially immersed in the main water container. Sometimes Styrofoam sheets with holes are used for suspending the plants.
The water in the main container is agitated or aerated with an aquarium pump. This extra aeration to the root zone helps reduce disease and keeps the roots healthy and strong. The main drawback is that power is required to run the system.
Instead of allowing the roots to remain submerged in water all the time, different types of arrangements for intermittent exposure have been developed. This allows more air-circulation around the roots, helping reduce root zone diseases.
Falling water – Nutrient solution is supplied to the beds from overhead sprinklers. It percolates down by gravity and gets recirculated. The root zone gets good air circulation, but the system involves pumping water for recirculation.
Flood and drain – The plants growing in the bed of inert medium are watered by intermittent flooding of the beds with the nutrient solution. The bed is them allowed to drain, exposing the roots to air.
Aeroponics
This is an improvement on hydroponics where growing medium is done away with. Plants are grown in holes cut into large pipes so that their roots remain inside the pipe. Nutrient solution is sprayed on to this root zone.
Aquaponics
This is a combination of hydroponics and aquaculture in which fish and other aquatic life are grown. It does away with the proprietary nutrient solutions used in hydroponics, replacing it with the nutrient-rich water discarded from aquaculture tanks.
The system uses an inert medium that gets colonized by microorganisms capable of breaking down aquaculture waste products. The water thus cleaned and filtered by the hydroponic bed gets recirculated into the aquaculture tanks.
A simple replication of aquaponics would be growing herbs, watercress or microgreens on Styrofoam sheets floating in an aquarium tank with their roots absorbing the nutrients generated from fish waste.
It is truly amazing the number of plants that can be grown without soil.  If you are ready for a change from conventional gardening why not try your green thumb at water gardening?

"Choosing a van hire company to rent a vehicle isn’t easy as there are many options available regardless of where you are in the country. Most van rental businesses are reliable but, unfortunately, there are those out there that can’t fulfill your requirements. If you need to hire a van for your new business but you’re unsure of what company you want to handle your requirements, have a look at some of the below points to consider before signing any van hire contract.
If you look at van hire Coventry for your van hiring needs, you’ll see that they offer thousands of different vans for different purposes. When hiring a van always make sure the company has other options for you in the future in case your needs change. A lot of businesses provide other types of vehicles for you to choose from, so if the needs of your business change, you’ll be able to adapt to another vehicle.
Any good van hire company will not only cover the costs of any repairs to the van if needed but they’ll also offer breakdown cover should you experience any problems on the road. MOTs and services will also likely be free and the only cost that you need to cover is for the van hire itself. Look for a company that offers flat fees for van hire, or at least a company that keeps the charges simple so your business finances are kept in order.
You’ll be surprised by how many hire van businesses don’t cover breakdown costs and you’ll have to either use your own cover or get your vehicle to a garage on your own terms. Most businesses offer this cover as standard, but always check to make sure you’re covered in case anything goes wrong. Van hire businesses will always offer presentable vehicles in excellent condition, but vehicles can suffer from mechanical problems regardless of how well maintained or new they are, so it’s always worth considering.
Depending on the van hire company will depend on the contract lengths they offer. Some businesses will let you hire a vehicle for a day or two whereas commercial van hire companies may require you to have a contract in place to use the vehicle for a year or so. Only hire a van if it suits your terms and be careful not to sign any contracts if you feel your needs might change in future.
Hiring a van from a reputable company doesn’t have to be hard and if you look at online reviews and research a business in detail you’ll likely be in the right hands. Try and hire a van from a local company so you can get help and advice whenever you need it and you’ll find you can’t go far wrong.",1
"Essays are literary pieces of information which clearly convey the opinions and emotions of the author. They consist of a number of elements like observations, criticism, opinions, political scenarios and recollections from the past. Newspapers and magazines are the repositories of essays where one can find different descriptions and narrations of different people from different parts of the world.
Essay writing is, in fact, made a part of our academics where it is agreed and understood to be a great tool in improving the writing skills of the students. Buy essays here to get the best essays. Essay writing also bears a predominant weight age of marks in all the types of examinations that help in understanding the level of intellectual capabilities, knowledge on various aspects, thought process and attitude of the students.
Essays are classified into expository, persuasive, analytical and argumentative types.
Expository type – is explaining an issue or idea to the readers and is a personal opinion of the writer on the event.
Persuasive type – is the one in which the readers are convinced to adopt the writer’s point of view.
Analytical type – are essays where the writer analyses and examines the main causes and its overall impacts of a particular incident or event.
Argumentative type – is where the writer proves that his\her opinion is appropriate than what others say.
Here are some key aspects that the writer should observe while writing an essay.
The foremost responsibility of a writer is to understand the topic and then brainstorm on what all facts that strike to his \ her mind pertaining to the topic. Then plan on the systematic flow of thoughts that need to be presented. Avoid the temptation to jump on writing as soon as you see the topic. A little planning here would get you a better output.
2. Decide on the style one wants to adopt
It is the writer’s choice on what style he \ she want to adopt for the given topic. But one very important aspect that the writer should remember is that the chosen style has to adopted throughout the essay. Fluctuations from one style to the other to impress upon the readers and leads to a confusion in understanding the writer’s opinion.
3. Maintain the flow of the sub-topics.
Put the random ideas as they flow in the brain and the arranging them into a logical and sequential order is very important.
One thing is that it is human nature to seek reasons and logic behind any aspect. Hence the writer should provide all the supportive facts and figures appropriately which can help the readers understand the opinion better.
Moving away from the topic is something that happens often when the writer tries to write more on the topic. Unless specified on the size of the essay, the writer should be concise on what he \ she wants to convey to the readers.
The essay should let the audiences know the writers command on the language. Use of appropriate and simple words impress on the readers and makes it easy for them to understand the message of the writer.
This is very important part of an essay and carries equal weight as introduction does. The conclusion should summarize the topic and it has to strike on the ultimate message of the entire essay.
8. Mistakes cost dearly – Always proof read
The writer should do a final proof reading to eliminate any grammatical or spelling errors in the essay. Especially in competitive examinations very small mistakes matter a lot.
To conclude, writing is a skill and can be improved on a continuous basis and as rightly said by Stephen King “Description begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s mind.
Apart from the above-given points some points that should be kept in mind are-
Be concise. Try to stick to the word limit as the audience is always in a hurry and would not go through very long essays.
Be honest. Don’t over speak about your achievements, titles, and offices.
Be an individual. In writing the essay, ask yourself, “How can I differentiate my essay from others. Work accordingly.
Be coherent. Obviously, you don’t want to babble, so write about just one subject at a time. Don’t try to cover everything in an essay. Doing so can make you sound busy, scattered and superficial.
Be accurate. Not only just use spell check (that goes without saying). Attend to the other mechanics of good writings, including conventional punctuation in the use of commas, semi-colons, etc.
Be vivid. A good essay is compared to a story: In many cases, it’s a description of an important moment. Provide some details to help the reader see the setting.
Be cautious in your use of humor. Humor is always in the eye of the beholder. Be funny only if you think you have to. Then think again.
Keeping these points in mind will make your essay stand out amongst the whole lot of essays of many students.",1
"Jacob Rothschild has accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of being a “traitor to the New World Order”.
Putin’s refusal to tow the New World Orderline makes Jacob Rothschild nervous, as he needs Russia on hissidein order to fulfil the illuminati agenda.
Obama is really getting on Putin’s nerves though because he can’t see why he’s doing the things he’s doing to his own people and warning Americans “Keep your Guns”!!
I know no more than anyone else about Putin, but I can deduce some things that might make sense.
First, He would not have reached as high up as he has, just like in America, if he had not been one of them and on their side.
He would never have been head of their intelligence KGB if he was not one of them, and he would never have made it to President.
Does that mean he could not turn on them and betray them? No, it just means that even if he had, he still has not suffered like others who have betrayed the group.",1
"Once you’ve done a spot test and there are no issues, simply add 2 ounces of the cleaning mixture and warm water to the rug cleaner’s reservoir. Following the carpet cleaner’s instructions, proceed with the task at hand. You can save any leftover cleaning solution for future jobs. Simply store it with the cap on the container.
According to the MarthaStewart.com website, home cleaning products for carpets are an ideal solution, as the site explains: “Some commercial spot removers take off the protective coatings or break down dyes that are found on most carpets.”
The site also includes a list of stains and the best products to clean them, with mention of hydrogen peroxide’s excellent ability to bleach stains “without breaking down carpet dyes.” She recommends using peroxide on stubborn stains such as “blood, berries, candy, chocolate, soft drinks/coffee, gravy, ice cream.”
The cleaning instructions advise: “Mix: Buy 3 percent solution at a drugstore and use full strength.
Technique: Scoop up solids with a spoon. Blot liquids. Rinse repeatedly. If stain persists, use soapy water, then rinse. Repeat. If improvement stops, dab on hydrogen peroxide. Wait one hour. Repeat as needed.”
The site also recommends hydrogen peroxide on mud stains, with the recommendation to allow the mud to dry and vacuum before rinsing with soapy water and using hydrogen peroxide to bleach the stain.",1
"As century-old Wall Street brokerages have agonized over the fate of a major U. S. regulation on retirement advice, younger Silicon Valley counterparts have coolly shrugged their shoulders.
At issue is when and how the federal government will implement the so-called “fiduciary rule” handed down by the U. S. Labor Department last year.
The rule, which aims to protect retirees by eliminating conflicts of interest for the brokers paid to advise them, was set to go into effect in April, but is being challenged by the Trump administration.
The rule is now on track to be delayed by 180 days – creating a great deal of uncertainty about its future.
Big wealth managers and insurers most affected by the rule have welcomed signs that the new White House may roll it back. They have fought hard against the rule in court and on Capitol Hill, arguing that it would raise compliance and technology costs, while restricting brokers’ ability to charge commissions and sell certain high-fee products.
Critics have said the additional costs would force brokerages to dump less well-heeled clients in favor of wealthier ones. Startups offering digital wealth management services have taken the opposite tack, saying the rule would benefit retirees and their own businesses. Investors abandoned by big firms might move to digital providers, which offer transparent, lower-cost alternatives, the thinking goes.
In interviews since Trump instructed the Labor Department to review the rule earlier this month, executives at “robo-advisers,” which manage investor money with algorithms, brushed off the impact of the rule on their business.
Although the rule might have sped up a broader shift of investor money to “robo-advisers,” the trend had been gathering momentum anyway, they said.
“An expansion of the fiduciary rule would be nice for our business, but in no way affects our ultimate success,” said Andy Rachleff, chief executive officer of Wealthfront, one of the largest robo-advisers that deals directly with investors.
Wealthfront competitor Betterment has encouraged Democrats in recent weeks to fight efforts to delay or gut the rule. Nonetheless, Betterment’s Associate General Counsel Seth Rosenbloom said any regulatory changes would have little impact on the company’s growth.
“We are sad that it looks like … the rule might go away, be delayed or watered down,” Rosenbloom said. “But we are optimistic that the attention around the issue will make for better informed investors in the long run.”
Among robo-advisers that provide services to brokerages, Mike Sha, co-founder and chief executive of robo-adviser SigFig, said he did not expect the rule’s delay to impact its business or partnerships at all. Wealth units of Wells Fargo & Co and UBS Group AG use SigFig’s technology and offer its online investing tools to their clients.
Robo-advisers represent a small piece of the wealth management industry, overseeing roughly $200 billion of client assets in 2016, according to consulting firm A. T. Kearney. It expects the total to surge to $2.2 trillion by 2020.
Interrupting the fiduciary rule could slow that growth for some companies. Last week, for instance, LPL Financial Holdings, said if the rule was delayed, it might move more slowly in rolling out some compliance plans, which include its robo-adviser and other new technology.
But the shift to less expensive digital options began before the rule was formalized, driven primarily by customer demand for more digital options. That trend is unlikely to be stopped with or without the rule, analysts said.
“By all projections, there is unbelievable demand for digital advice and solutions,” said Kendra Thompson, a managing director in the financial services group at the consultancy Accenture. The rule is “an accelerator for digital, not an originator,” she said.",1
"A top US manufacturer of lawn and garden pesticides said it plans to eliminate products containing the neonicotinoid class of chemicals, the use of which has been linked to a massive decline in honeybee population.
In an announcement on Tuesday, Ortho,a division of Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, said that it will cease the use of neonicotinoid (“neonic”) ingredients imidacloprid, clothianidin and dinotefuran by 2017, while phasing out neonics in eight products that are used to kill garden pests by the year 2021.
Tim Martin, Ortho’s vice president and general manager, said the company will also begin a “multi-year partnership” with pollinator advocacy organizations to “to promote pollinator habitat” and “homeowner education” initiatives to encourage “responsible use of pesticides where pollinators can be found.”
“This decision comes after careful consideration regarding the range of possible threats to honey bees and other pollinators,” Martin said in a statement. “While agencies in the United States are still evaluating the overall impact of neonics on pollinator populations, it’s time for Ortho to move on.”
Martin added that the change may require gardeners to apply Ortho products more frequently than is currently recommended, and that the cost of products will not change significantly.
Neonics attack the central nervous systems of insects, causing tremors, paralysis, and death. The insecticide is absorbed into treated plants and distributed in their vascular systems, rendering various parts – including the roots, leaves, stem, flowers, nectar, pollen and guttation fluid – toxic to insects.
Neonics like imidacloprid were developed in the 1990s to boost yields of staple crops such as corn, but they are also widely used on annual and perennial plants in lawns and gardens. Researchers believe the neonics are causing some kind of biological reaction in bees that has been blamed for Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), the disease killing off honeybees and threatening pollination of the world’s crops.
While regulatory agencies in the US are still assessing the impact of neonics on bee populations, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hassaid imidacloprid can be a threat to various bees and other pollinators.
Groups wary of pesticide use refer to currentresearch blaming the cause of CCD on two major types of neonics, including imidacloprid. Another study found that bees exposed to “field-realistic” doses of neonics gatherless than half the pollen that they normally do, causing starvation among their young.
Environmentalists are calling on the EPA to join the European Commission in adopting a moratorium on such insecticides. In 2013, The EC instituted atwo-year moratorium on the use of three neonic pesticides, including imidacloprid.
In 2015, the EPA proposed aprohibition on the use of pesticidesthat are toxic to bees –including neonics – when crops are in bloom, andtemporarily halted the approval of new outdoor neonic uses until new bee data is submitted and pollinator risk assessments are complete.
In March, the US Fish and Wildlife Service said it willconsider protecting two species of wild bumblebees under the Endangered Species Act.
Meanwhile, major neonic producers like Bayer CropScience and Syngenta havesaid that claims of neonic effects on bee populations were exaggerated.",1
"During a pregnancy, women often want a support group consisting of their partner, family, and friends in order to get through the difficult parts of beingpregnant.
When Brianna, a young woman who did not reveal her last name, got pregnant this past year, she was initially surrounded by this same group and was confident going into her pregnancy. Then, suddenly, her whole life changed and she nearly lost the most important person in her life: her husband.
During a pregnancy, women often want a support group consisting of their partner, family, and friends in order to get through the difficult parts of beingpregnant.
When Brianna, a young woman who did not reveal her last name, got pregnant this past year, she was initially surrounded by this same group and was confident going into her pregnancy. Then, suddenly, her whole life changed and she nearly lost the most important person in her life: her husband.
When she was already more than eight months pregnant, she awoke one morning thinking it was a day like any other. Her husband was not with her because he worked nights, often turning toenergy drinksto keep himself awake.
“I still remember my mother-in-law waking me up that morning. ‘Austin had an accident’ she said,”Brianna recounted.
Austin’s family had no idea what had happened, but they knew they had to get to him as soon as possible. He was at ahospitalthat was 2 hours away and the family rushed there with no information about his condition. When they arrived, they learned that Austin had suffered from a brain hemorrhage, which is a type of stroke that results in localized bleeding in the brain and kills brain cells.
“The doctors concluded (after running his tox screen and ruling out drugs) that this horrible event was due to his recent excessive energy drink consumption (a habit he had built when he started working longer hours and commuting),” Brianna said.
Brianna’s claims are what caused the Facebook post to be canceled, as no further evidence for the claim that energy drinks caused Austin’s brain to hemorrhage was produced nor was it confirmed that the doctor actually pointed to energy drinks as the main cause.
Energy drinkshave been shown to increase blood pressure to dangerous levels, and high blood pressure can lead to hemorrhaging, but the specific link between energy drink consumption and brain hemorrhages isn’t yet supported in the medical community. Nevertheless, Austin has suffered some major consequences from his brain hemorrhage, the first of which involved missing the birth of his son.
About a week after she had given birth, and several weeks after Austin’s brain first hemorrhaged and he had undergone major surgeries as well as extreme strokes and seizures, Brianna was finally able to make it back to Austin’s hospital to see him. Despite overcoming the worst possible scenario for his condition, Brianna saw that Austin would always carry the evidence of his condition because the hemorrhage had taken the top portion of his skull.
“He isn’t the same man I fell in love with, but I still fall further everyday, We are fighting to help him recover. To make his life better. One day we will get there. Until then, I will never give up on him. Because love is selfless, and I love him more than life itself,” Brianna said.",1

A bear eats frozen fruit at the city zoo in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Animals you see at zoos are often given frozen snacks tohelp them cool off from the intense summer heat. (Silvia Izquierdo/Associated Press)    Washington summers are beastly. Between the heat and humidity, it’s hard to keep from wilting like a flower. Of course, given how inventive humans are, we can beat the heat with air conditioning, an afternoon at the pool or a double scoop of rocky road ice cream. But what about the rest of the animal kingdom? What tricks do animals have up their sleeves (or should that be fur) to keep cool?  Shedding: One characteristic of being a mammal is having hair on your body. Some mammals, such as dolphins, have only whiskers (and those fall out shortly after birth). Most have a dense coat of fur. During winter, fur thickens to protect animals from the cold. The opposite occurs in warm weather. By shedding, less heat is “trapped” in the animal’s body, allowing it to cool off.  Hiding: On a scorching summer day, you might hide from the sun under an umbrella. Animals do the same thing, only they use natural umbrellas in the form of foliage. They also hide under rocks, fallen trees and any other structure that blocks the sun’s rays. Some animals stay hidden all day and come out at night to feed.  Sweating: When you sweat, water rises to the surface of your skin. As the water evaporates, it cools the skin slightly. Most animals don’t sweat. Horses are an exception to this rule. So are dogs, except they sweat only through their paws, which isn’t enough to keep cool.   A Siberian tiger takes a swim at a zoo in Wuhan, in China. (Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)   Panting: When you exhale, heat leaves the body with your breath. Dogs, cats and lots of other animals cool off by panting. Birds do it as well, so if you see an open-mouthed bird on a hot day, there’s a good chance it’s panting. However, unlike dogs, birds don’t have a big, sloppy tongue hanging out of their mouths.  Pooping: Bird poop is gooey because it contains lots of water. Storks and vultures take advantage of this by pooping on their legs during the summer. When the water in the poop evaporates, it provides a cooling effect.  Swimming: Jumping into a swimming pool not only cools you off, but it’s also lots of fun. Animals do the next best thing: They seek out ponds, rivers, streams or any body of water they can find. Some, such as pigs, prefer mud because it keeps them cool longer and protects their skin from insects.  Radiating heat: Elephants and hares have very large ears compared with their body sizes. During the summer, more blood circulates through the blood vessels in their ears, releasing heat into the environment.   Sleeping: Bears hibernate to avoid the challenging conditions of winter. Some animals use a variation of this technique to avoid the hot, dry conditions of summer. The name for this state is “estivation.” The water-holding frog avoids the harsh summer months by burrowing into sandy ground and protecting itself inside a “cocoon” made of mucus.   Eating cold treats: Many zoo animals get cold treats during the summer. Examples include frozen fruit for bears, frozen fish for sea otters and blood ice pops for lions.",0
"Poland has said thanks but no thanks to a $9.2bn credit line from theRothschild owned IMF.
According to Poland’s finance ministry, Warsaw will withdraw from the International Monetary Fund’s precautionary Flexible Credit Line (FCL) which is worth billions of dollars.
The ministry quoted Finance Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on Twitter saying: “We are resigning from a $9.2 billion credit line from the IMF. The Polish economy is in such a good situation that we can do it”
RT reports: The country’s budget posted a record surplus of $1.36 billion for the period from January to August as a result of a steep rise in revenue from value-added tax. Economic growth was almost four percent.
I have taken the decision to quit the FCL after an analysis of tax data, macroeconomic parameters, assessment of our budget stability and currency reserves,” Morawiecki was cited as saying.
In January, the Executive Board of the IMF approved a two-year arrangement for Poland worth about 8.2 billion at that time.
The fund said the credit line would “provide valuable insurance against external shocks.”
“A possible growth slowdown and banking sector stress in the euro area could have significant spillovers via trade, financial, and confidence channels,” said the IMF.
The Flexible Credit Line has been in place for Poland to use at times of crisis since 2009, but the country has never drawn on the funds. Last year Poland asked the IMF to halve the value of the FCL.",1
"After its much ballyhooed presentation of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 and its Bixby smart assistant, Samsung is delaying the best part of Bixby -- voice control.
Positioned as a competitor to Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Google Now, Bixby will not have key featuers available when the phone ships on April 21, but instead will come in a software update later this year.
SAMSUNG JUST UNVEILED ITS NEW GALAXY S8 SMARTPHONE
“Key features of Bixby, including Vision, Home, and Reminder, will be available with the global launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 on April 21. Bixby Voice will be available in the US on the Galaxy S8 later this spring,” Samsung said in a statement to The Verge.
The software update is scheduled to come in the Spring, but the company did not give an exact date.
Some features of the smart assistant will be available upon launch, like its augmented reality features, making suggestions on apps to use based on location, time of day and learning habits over time.
Samsung included a dedicated button on the phone's side for Bixby in an effort to place the spotlight on it and differentiate it from other smart assistants.",0
"A sprinkler system is one of the most effective tools available to prevent the spread of fire in tall buildings. Grenfell Tower and thousands of others in the UK do not have sprinklers installed. Reality Check explores the reasons.
Regulations in England mean that only buildings constructed since 2007 and which are taller than 30m are required to have sprinklers fitted. This requirement wasn't applied retroactively so did not apply to Grenfell Tower, which was built in 1974.
Existing high-rises in England must have them fitted if a fundamental change is made to the structure or use of the building.
These regulations are the same in Northern Ireland. In Scotland all new residential buildings taller than 18m must be fitted with sprinklers. In Wales since last year, all new and refurbished residential accommodation must have sprinklers. Nowhere in the UK is it a requirement to retroactively fit sprinklers in existing buildings.
This tragedy has brought back memories of other fires in high-rise blocks and warnings ignored. The World at One has looked into what recommendations were made in the past.
After a fire at Shirley Towers, Southampton, in 2010, which killed two firefighters, the coroner said: ""Social housing providers should be encouraged to consider the retrofitting of sprinklers in all existing high-rise buildings in excess of 30 metres in height.""
In 2005, a fire at Harrow Court in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, killed a woman and two firefighters trying to rescue her. The Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service report recommended the UK Fire Service should explore options for high-rise buildings, including the ""provision of sprinklers"".
After six people died at Lakanal House in south London in 2009, the coroner said ""It is recommended that [the Department for Communities and Local Government] encourage providers of housing in high-rise residential buildings containing multiple domestic premises to consider the retrofitting of sprinkler systems.""
Fewer than 1% of council tower blocks are fitted with sprinklers - so what does it cost to fit a new sprinkler system in an old building?
Sir Ken Knight, the author of a report on the Lakanal House fire, said that while there was significant evidence of the effectiveness of systems such as sprinklers controlling fire spread in buildings, it was not considered ""practical or economically viable"" to enforce the retrospective fitting of fire suppression systems to all current high-rise residential buildings.
The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association (BAFSA), the trade body for the fire sprinkler industry, said retrofitting Grenfell Tower with sprinklers might have cost 200,000. This is the figure for installing a sprinkler system but does not include potential maintenance fees or costs associated with the wider redevelopment of a building.
Costing will of course vary from building to building. After the Shirley Towers fire in 2010, it cost the council 1m to install sprinklers in three tower blocks.
The cost can be high because in blocks made of concrete and steel like Grenfell, the process is difficult and time-consuming. So the focus has been on other measures which would contain a fire to stop it spreading.
However, Roy Wilsher, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council, said it is ""certainly something we need to look at again"".
He also said that if the fire spread up the outside of a high-rise, as it is reported to have done at Grenfell Tower, then sprinklers might not have made a difference.
The Grenfell fire was similar to one that broke out in Dubai in 2016 - the difference is ""that building had sprinklers and nobody was killed"", according to Alan Brinson of the European Fire Sprinkler Network.
In 2015, a spokesman for the Chief Fire Officers Association said that nobody had ever died in a fire in the UK in a property with a ""properly installed sprinkler system working the way it's meant to"".",0
"Everyone knows that hydrogen peroxide is great for cleaning wounds, but there is so much more to this chemical compound!
From sanitizing surfaces, to busting out stubborn carpet stains, and everything in between – hydrogen peroxide works wonders. After checking out this long list of “unheard of” uses, this strange liquid will be your go-to tool for almost everything!
Disclaimers:
– The majority of these tips call for a 3% consistency of hydrogen peroxide (which is what’s commonly used in bottles).
– The abbreviation “HP” will be used to replace “hydrogen peroxide” in the tips below.
So, let’s start learning about all of the great thing hydrogen peroxide has to offer!
Body
Beat Most Bodily Viruses: All you have to do to help rid your body of infections and viruses such as the common cold and flu is place 3 drops of HP in each ear. Allow the solution to sit for 10 minutes, then drain it from ears by turning head slowly to each slide.
An Effective Mouth Rinse: Due to its chemical composition, HP is wonderful for fighting mouth-bred germs and bacteria. Simply gargle a cup of water combined with two capfuls of HP.
Get Shiny, White Teeth: Most people don’t know that HP is a common ingredient in most commercial teeth whitening recipes. To get the most out of this powerful oxidation process, just brush your teeth like normal. Once you’re done brushing, mix two tablespoons of water with 1 teaspoon of HP. Then gargle the mixture for 60 seconds, spit it out and rinse your mouth thoroughly with clean water. You can do this up to three times a week!
Highlight Your Hair In Minutes: Use a spray bottle to spritz HP on damp hair. Allow the HP to sit on your locks for 15 minutes before rinsing it off in the shower. After just a few times doing repeating this process, you’ll be left with lighter tresses!
No More Painful Toothache: Combine a half-ounce of HP and a half-ounce of coconut oil (works best to do this in a shot glass) and gargle the mixture! The antibacterial properties will get rid of infection and will help soothe any pain you may feel.
Instant Wound Cleaning: When you have small cuts and abrasions, pour a capful of HP directly over it. This will instantly disinfect and help the wound heal faster!
Silky, Smooth Skin: Get rid of annoying acne and discoloration by washing your face with HP. Not only will the chemical clean your pores, but it will also fight against any new acne that might pop up!
Say Goodbye To Earwax: Hidden inner earwax is harder and most irritating to eradicate! But by pouring two drops of HP in each ear, followed by two drops of olive oil, the wax will drain right out! You’ll normally have to allow the mixture to sit in each ear canal for 3-4 minutes before the wax becomes liquified.
The Best Hand Sanitizer: Your hands will be bacteria-free if you spritz a tiny bit of HP solution over them. The chemical compound acts like an antibacterial soap and will protect against the spread of germs!
A Fun Foot Scrub: Rough feet and hard calluses can be removed with just a bit of HP! Simply add a half-cup of HP to your bathwater and allow your tootsies to soak for roughly 30 minutes!
Home
Clean Your Germy Toothbrush: Your toothbrush harbors all types of germs and bacteria. But if you allow it to soak for an hour or so, the bristles will be germ-free and you can brush your teeth with a cleared conscious.
Every-Type-Of-Stain Remover: Stubborn, stuck on fabric stains (especially blood, sweat and other bodily causes) can be buffed out with ease. Just pour a bit of HP directly on the stain and allow it to sit for 60 seconds. Then gently rinse the area with cold water – you can repeat this process as many times as needed until the stain disappears!
Dishwashing Powertool: Another great use for HP is as a replacement dishwasher soap. If you chose to use this for a dishwashing cycle, be sure to thoroughly rinse the dinnerware before placing them in the machine. HP isn’t as effective as other detergents for removing hardened food remnants.
No More Annoying Odors: It’s a little-known secret that HP removes unpleasant odors from pets and foods – and it works especially well on fabrics. Just combine white vinegar and HP in a bucket and allow the smelly fabrics to soak. Then place them into the washing machine and allow a normal cycle to run! The odors will be no more!
The Best Lunchbox Cleaner: After storing food day-in and day-out, lunchboxes become the perfect places to harbor germs. But just use a water-HP solution in a spray bottle and give it a spritz. After a few seconds, wipe it down and feel comfortable sending your loved ones off with a bacteria-free meal!
Your Toilet Will Look Like New: All you need to do to get shiny porcelain is pour a half-cup of HP into the bowl and allow it to sit for 30 minutes! Not only will it leave it looking brand new, but it will also disinfect one of the most bacteria-prone places in our homes!
Banish Mold For Good: With your handy, dandy water-HP spray bottle you filled earlier, apply a heavy layer onto annoying mold spots. Allow it to sit for 10 minutes and scrub the area with the hard side of a sponge after the allotted time has passed. Be sure to wear gloves and avoid any direct skin contact!
Streak-Free Glass Cleaner: Pesky soap, dirt and daily grime on glass surfaces can be busted out in a second with HP. Use the same water-HP spray bottle as before and apply a light layer of liquid. Let it sit for a few minutes and use a paper towel or newspaper to wipe it off! The best part is that there’s not a streak in sight!
Clean Your Cutting Boards: With all of the raw meats, vegetables and other food items prepared on your wooden cutting boards, it’s only right to clean them the correct way. To disinfect them thoroughly (without ruining the wood surface), spray the water-HP mix on both sides and allow it to soak into the grains for several minutes. Then rinse the surface with cold water!
A Spotless Refrigerator: Just like the lunchbox from earlier, the fridge is an ideal place for germs to stick around! But with just a quick spray of the water-HP solution and a few minutes to do the work, you’ll be left with a cleaned, disinfected place to store your foods! Be sure to wipe the excess liquid off before returning your food into the fridge!
Potent Toy Cleaner: New playmates, curious pets, dirty hands and a million other common reasons causes the spread of germs onto your precious kid’s toys! But use the water-HP solution in the spray bottle to battle these types of dangerous bacteria. Just wipe them down with a paper towel or rag after a few minutes to act!
Burnt Foods Aren’t A Problem Anymore: Stuck-on food stains can ruin your favorite bakeware. But not anymore! Just mix HP with baking soda to form a thick paste. Scrub the paste on the stubborns stains with an old toothbrush and allow it to sit for 10 minutes or so. After the time is up, scrub the area with warm water until the stain is removed!
Purify Stagnant Humidifier Water: Millions of children around the country benefit from a humidifier in their room while they sleep! But after weeks of use, that water can become a breeding ground for cold and bacteria! Luckily, all you have to do is add one pint of HP for every gallon you place in the humidifier. This will keep the water clean and prevent molds from spreading to your little one’s lungs!
Now that you know all of the true benefits of hydrogen peroxide, it’s time to spread the knowledge to your friends and loved ones! They need to know how to get the most out of this magical liquid as well!

"Chances are, not every item in your suitcase needs to go with you on vacation. Lighten your load by casting off unnecessary extras. From hair dryers and toiletries to makeup bags and magazines, here are 12 things to cross off your packing list.
We're not saying you shouldn't enjoy a good read on vacation. But if you've got a Kindle or tablet, you can free up valuable space by leaving the paperback books and magazines at home. Electronic options are slim and lightweight, and allow you to load up more reading material than you could ever hope to finish on vacation.
A different outfit for each day
We all like having options, but almost no one needs an entirely new ensemble for each day of the trip. Packing this way is one of the quickest ways to run out of room in your luggage — and chances are, you won't end up wearing half of what you brought.
For all but the longest trips, most people can get away with bringing three tops and three bottoms that are practical and comfortable, and that can be mixed and matched. If you're worried about running out of clean outfits, plan on doing a load of laundry on the road, or simply hand wash a few items when you need to.
Denim is ideal for travel because it's versatile, long-lasting, and hides stains well. But, it's also heavy and takes up a lot of space, even when folded tightly.
So pack your favorite pair of jeans, but stick to one or two pairs at most, and mix in lightweight bottoms like cotton or linen pants, leggings, jeggings, performance fabrics, or khakis.
Instead of bringing your entire toiletries bag, take advantage of the free stuff you can get at your hotel.
Most properties provide shampoo, conditioner, soapand lotion, but that doesn't mean that’s all they have in stock. Some hotels also have a supply of deodorant, toothpaste, mouthwash, razors, shaving cream, feminine hygiene products, and even sewing kits. The secret is, you have to ask for it.
Chances are, you don't use every item in your makeup bag regularly, so why take the whole thing?
Stick to the products you use on an everyday basis, and nothing more. Try limiting yourself to a cover-up, a blush or bronzer, an eyeliner pencil, minimal eye shadow, mascaraand a lip color. Or, consider one of these makeup kits, which come with a variety of cosmetics all in one travel-size palette.
Leave your blow-dryer, straightener, curling ironand large bottles of hair products at home — they eat up a ton of luggage space, and take over the bathroom once you've unpacked.
Most hotel rooms already have a hair dryer, and some properties are even offering hair straighteners now, too. Confirm this with the hotel in advance to avoid packing more than you need.
If your hotel doesn't offer styling tools, invest in travel-size options, or, simply make do without — after all, it's only temporary.
More than two devices
Unless you're traveling for business, you can probably make do with just a smartphone. But if you're considering packing other devices — such as an iPad, tablet, laptopor Kindle — limit yourself to two at most. Here's why: Overpacking gadgets leads to suboptimal vacations. Either you find yourself constantly distracted by your tech gear, or you end up not using most of what you packed. Choose wisely and preserve your vacation time and your packing space.
You might want to look like a fashion icon on your next trip, but don't be tempted to pack your nicest watch, jewelry, designer purseand any other nonessential embellishments. Traveling with valuables will make you a prime target for pickpockets, and you'll run the risk of losing or leaving the smaller accessories behind.
It's okay to bring a snack for the plane, but there's no reason to stash excessive amounts of food in your luggage.
If your goal is to save money, plan on buying a few staple items, such as coffee, cerealand milk, when you arrive. But in your effort to save, don't miss out on the local delicacies of the destination you are visiting. After all, isn't the food part of the vacation experience?
Unless you're going camping, don't pack your own sheets and towels. Hotels, hostels, and vacation rentals nearly always provide them. And if for some reason yours doesn't, consider it a sign that you should probably find a different place to stay.
There's nothing worse than suffering through a vacation in the wrong shoes, so choose them carefully.
Leave behind any footwear of questionable comfort — like high heels and ballet flats — and any that haven't been broken in.
Only pack two or three of your most comfortable and versatile shoes — try bringing one good pair of walking sneakers, and one or two other pairs of supportive shoes that can be dressed up or down.
That 'just in case' gear
Avoid packing for situations that are unlikely to happen. For example, you don't need to pack rain gear if you’re visiting somewhere dry, or a winter coat if you’re going to the tropics — you won’t end up using them. The same thing goes for anything you might do. If you aren't a hiker, don't bring hiking boots. Set realistic plans so you don't end up packing unnecessary gear.

"Actress Zelda Williams isn’t worried about being compared to her famous father, late comedian/actor Robin Williams.
“I didn’t go into acting with any ideas of where I’d wind up,” the 27-year-old told PEOPLE magazine. “Maybe this is pessimistic, but I knew I was never going to be my father, so I went into it because I love it.”
But like Robin, Zelda wants to do more than just appear in front of cameras. She explained to the celebrity news publication that screenwriting is another passion.
“It’s not some ‘Let me get back at my parents by being more famous’ kind of thing,” she said. “I wrote a young adult TV show that I hope I get to make because I have five godchildren.”
Zelda, who found solace in writing and acting after her father’s passing in 2014 at age 63 from suicide, also hopes to make a lasting impact in Hollywood.
“I grew up with ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’ and shows that didn’t sexualize everything and didn’t titillate everything,” she said. “I’m like, can you just give someone a really smart, spunky female lead? I want the butt-kicking show!”",0
"It looks like the fat cats in the banking world are now trying to dictate to us what we can and can’t do with our own hard earned money.

After months of giving mixed signals from governments around the world regarding the regulation of Bitcoin. A Lakestone Bank and Trust customer, Jordan Spencer, took to Facebook to share a letter he received on December 14th which threatened to close his account for a “policy violation.”
According to the letter, Spencer has been using a popular Coinbase website to make cryptocurrency purchases and deposits which is tied to his personal bank account. This apparently is a violation according to loss prevention officer Louise Vermillion.
The full letter from the bank has been made available below:
So let me get this straight, Jordan Spencer is about to lose his bank account because he’s buying bitcoin? Which currently is worth a lot more, and is more stable than the American Dollar and the Stock Market? Since when do banking institutions dictate how we can and can’t use our own money? Why did we ever bail these institutions out to begin with?
Strategist on the Big Bitcoin Correction: ‘I’m Surprised It Took So Long’
The cryptocurrency’s dramatic fall on Friday has prompted many to wonder if the Bitcoin bubble has finally burst.
Overstock CEO Weighs on Bitcoin Price Plunge
Bitcoin continued its downward spiral on Friday, as prices fell more than 30% at one point and shed almost half their value after hitting a record high earlier in the week.
By Friday afternoon, Bitcoin had recovered to around $13,000, a roughly 20% loss, but still a far cry from Bitcoin’s record high price of $19,783 reached on Sunday. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple were also slumping on Friday, with all but two of the top 100 cryptocurrencies trading lower, according to CoinMarketCap.
The selloff has prompted many market watchers to wonder if the Bitcoin bubble has officially popped, or if it could instead be a result of profit-taking before prices head higher again.
Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said he was anticipating some degree of a cryptocurrency correction, due in part to the recent headlines surrounding heightened regulation and increasing perceptions that a bubble was forming among digital currencies.
“I’m actually a little surprised it took so long for the cryptos to sell off,” O’Rourke explained.
O’Rourke pointed to how Litecoin founder Charlie Lee said on Wednesday that he’d sold and donated all of his tokens this week, citing a conflict of interest. He said the move would be similar to if Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN – Get Report) CEO Jeff Bezos announced he’d sold all his shares in the internet giant.
“When you think about it from a stock market perspective, if you walked in and found out Jeff Bezos sold all his Amazon stock, or if Mark Zuckerberg sold his Facebook Inc. (FB – Get Report) shares, or if Elon Musk sold his stock in Tesla Inc. (TSLA – Get Report) ,” he said. “Almost overnight, those stocks would be down massively.”
Litecoin fell about 6% on Thursday after Lee made his announcement.
Bitcoin is being compared to past investing manias.
According to O’Rourke, the recent plunge in prices of digital currencies during the last few days is likely tied to profit taking, Whether it’s longtime bitcoin holders or “newcoiners” that are pulling out of cryptocurrencies is unclear, however. The frenzy around bitcoin mania may be deterring some investors who can’t figure out where cryptocurrencies are headed next and are realizing it’s not the safest trading environment to be in right now.
“Over the past couple of days, we’ve seen a little more euphoria, especially as it filtered over into the stock market,” O’Rourke said. “It became way too euphoric and people started to take profits and realize these things have had an incredible run this year.”
Bitcoin started off 2017 trading at roughly $1,000 before skyrocketing to almost $20,000 earlier this month. Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University, said that given the levels that Bitcoin started trading at, this week’s sell-off isn’t as big as some are making it out to be.
The drawdown in prices is consistent with recent volatility, Harvey added. In fact, Harvey said that based on Bitcoin’s past volatility, there’s a one-in-20 chance of a 25% swing in either direction occurring in any given week.
“The current drawdown is also consistent with a price that was artificially driven up by bandwagon investors assuming that Bitcoin would gain 1,500+% in 2018,” Harvey explained.
Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has led some market watchers to wonder if we’re on the cusp of a Bitcoin bubble. Others have been reassured by the possibility of institutional investors entering the space via Bitcoin futures or exchange-traded funds, with the idea that the vehicles could lessen some of volatility of digital currencies.
As long as the frenzied speculation continues in the cryptocurrency market, O’Rourke said he expects volatility to continue in the near term. To get a taste for the euphoric speculation in Bitcoin and other currencies, just look to the growing number of companies which added blockchain to their name, only to see their stock shoot up almost immediately.
O’Rourke pointed to fintech microlender LongFin, which went public at $6.65 per share last week. After announcing that it acquired “blockchain microlending” company Ziddu.com, LongFin’s stock traded above $26 a share. On Monday, it climbed as high as $142 per share, before declining to about $40 on Friday.
These kinds of speculative plays on the bitcoin craze are just one reason why O’Rourke said he thinks investors should be wary of cryptocurrencies.
“When you’re involved in pure speculation, you’re at the market’s whim,” O’Rourke explained. “The SEC is right in that it’s a buyer beware situation.”It looks like the fat cats in the banking world are now trying to dictate to us what we can and can’t do with our own hard earned money.
Now setting all these factors aside, the mere fact that bitcoin jumps so high and falls so low should have any investor out there very concerned. But at the same time, when the stock market is just paper and our dollar isn’t backed by anything tangible, what’s the difference? After all, we have all learned by now that when the crap hits the fan, as it did in 2008, only those who are deemed “Too big to fail” are the ones who get the help, while the rest of us fall like dominoes.
Please share if you agree banks shouldn’t be allowed to tell us how to spend our own money….",1
"Have you ever wondered what honey really is and why it’s so good for you?
According to Live Science, bees make honey from flower nectar, using tube-shaped tongues to extract the nectar and store it in second stomachs. The nectar mixes with enzymes in these extra stomachs. Bees then pass the substance on to other bees in a digestive assembly line until the last bee deposits the honey into the honeycomb. Bees fan the honeycomb with their wings until all the extra water is evaporated. The honeycomb is then sealed with a substance that hardens into what we know as beeswax.
But why do bees make honey? Because it’s their food source! So what makes honey so nutritious? According to Benefits of Honey, honey is approximately 80 percent natural sugar and 18 percent water. The remaining 2 percent is vitamins and minerals, as well as pollen and protein. Though honey is high in sugar, it is not bad for you when consumed in moderate amounts. In fact, the vitamins and minerals make honey really quite healthy. Continue reading to learn how regularly consuming and otherwise using honey can benefit your health!
1. More energy. Nutra Ingredients reports a study by the University of Memphis Exercise and Sport Nutrition Laboratory found honey to be an effective pre- and postworkout energy source for athletes. This is because, unlike other carbohydrates, honey does not cause blood sugar to drop after the initial spike. Honey has also been found to improve power and speed in endurance athletes.
This is good news for everyone, not just athletes. Instead of drinking a sugary soda for a mid-day pick-me-up, try eating a piece of toast with a tablespoon of honey.
2. Burn fat. Not only does honey give you more energy, it also helps you burn fat! Mike McInnes, founder of the “Hibernation Diet,” says that consuming a spoonful of honey before bedtime can help burn fat. This is because honey can speed up your metabolism and reduce stress hormones as you sleep. Try a detox drink made from cinnamon tea and honey, as recommended by Natural News.
3. Heal cuts and burns. According to Dr. Axe, manuka and linden honey are particularly good for healing cuts and wounds. This is because they have strong antibiotic properties. Rub honey directly on the affected area. You can also use these types of honey to heal acne.
4. Treat cough. WebMD says that just 2 teaspoons of honey 30 minutes before going to bed can suppress a nighttime cough. This method is safe and effective for adults and children above the age of 1.
5. Relieve nausea. Honey, when combined with lemon, is a wondrous treatment for nausea. Many pregnant women suffering from morning sickness know this, but Blessed Herbs explains the science. The astringency of lemon clears toxins from an agitated stomach. But it needs the delivery system of honey to slowly release the lemon’s cleansing power.
6. Lower high blood pressure. LiveStrong reports honey contains a special type of carbohydrate known as oligosaccharide. This carbohydrate doubles as an antioxidant and an amazing blood-pressure-lowering mechanism. If you suffer from high blood pressure, it may be a good idea to add a tablespoon of honey to your daily diet.
7. Treat dandruff. A study from Dubai says the antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant properties in honey make it an effective treatment for even the most severe symptoms of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, like hair loss and scaling. To use this home remedy, gently rub honey diluted with warm water onto your scalp. Let the honey sit for three hours and then gently rinse with warm water. Do this every day until your symptoms subside. Maintain a healthy scalp by applying honey once weekly.
8. Better sleep. David Wolfe swears that eating a bit of honey and Himalayan salt results in a restful night’s sleep. He explains this works because Himalayan salt contains magnesium, which reduces the stress hormone cortisol and makes it easier to fall asleep. Honey on the other hand, supports the body by healing the liver and other organs as you sleep. Wolfe recommends mixing 5 teaspoons honey and 1 teaspoon Himalayan salt and storing in a jar. Every night, dissolve 1 teaspoon of the mixture under your tongue.
Honey is one of the sweetest, most delicious naturally occurring foods on the planet. It’s amazing that it has so many health benefits! So what are you waiting for? Add a teaspoon to your morning tea. Try it in coffee or slather it on a piece of whole-grain toast. Mix it in with yogurt or add it to your favorite vinaigrette. The possibilities, like its benefits, are endless!

"People hoping to lose a few pounds by substituting artificial sweeteners for regular sugar may end up disappointed, suggests a fresh look at past research.
The review of 37 studies suggests the use of so-called non-nutritive sweeteners could be linked to weight gain and other undesirable outcomes like high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.
""From all that research, there was no consistent evidence of a long term benefit from the sweetener, but there was evidence for weight gain and increased risks of other cardiometabolic outcomes,"" said lead author Meghan Azad, of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada.
Artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose and stevioside are growing increasingly popular as evidence mounts that sugar is fueling the obesity epidemic, Azad and colleagues write in CMAJ.
The artificial sweeteners are chemically different than sugar. They activate receptors on the tongue that lets the brain know the person is eating or drinking something sweet.
Past research on these sweeteners shows a mixed bag of results, including links to weight gain, as well as links to weight loss, according to the authors of the new review.
For the analysis, they looked through the medical literature for studies examining possible links between artificial sweeteners and weight or health issues like obesity.
The researchers found seven randomized controlled trials, which are considered the gold-standard of medical research. Some of the trials, for example, compared people who drank artificially sweetened beverages to people who drank water. The researchers also found 30 studies that followed people using the sweeteners over time.
They found no link between the use of artificial sweeteners and changes in body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of weight in relation to height, among the 1,003 people in the randomized controlled trials. They also didn't find a link between the sweeteners and other outcomes.
Among the 405,907 people included in the 30 other studies, the researchers found that artificial sweeteners were tied to a small increase in BMI, weight, waist size, obesity, high blood pressure, heart problems and metabolic syndrome.
""I think it's cause for some caution and rethinking whether or not these products are without any effect,"" Azad told Reuters Health.
The researchers caution, however, that the studies that followed people over time may be biased since artificial sweeteners are promoted as a treatment for conditions like obesity or diabetes. Also, the randomized controlled trials were relatively short.
Azad also said they were not able to look at individual sweeteners.
""It's possible that different sweeteners have different effects, but we were not able to examine that because of the studies available,"" she said.
The risks and benefits of these sweeteners need to be evaluated, but the science examining those benefits is lacking, said Sai Das of the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston, who was not involved with the new study.
""It is time for the science to look at what - if any - benefits there are to see if that is meaningful enough to outweigh the risks that have been highlighted,"" Das told Reuters Health.
Until there is better research, Das said, people should use be cautious about using artificial sweeteners.",0
"Mid-table is in the eye of the beholder. These two teams are a point apart halfway down (or up) the Premier League table. For the ninth-placed visitors it is a cause for doubts, uncertainty and the odd glance over the shoulder. For the hosts, now in 12th, it means success, affirmation and calls for feet to stay connected to the ground.
Southampton took an early lead thanks to Steven Davis, who turned home a rebound from James Ward-Prowse’s well-executed free-kick. Glenn Murray restored parity shortly after half-time with a canny striker’s header. There were few other chances to write about, which suited neither manager, but their mutual disappointment came from very different perspectives.
“Confidence is as high as it’s been this season“ said Brighton’s Chris Hughton. “We’ve got good players and if we play at the right level we know we’ve got a chance of getting results. Home form will be so important for us in this division and it was just the end product that was lacking today. We had a lot of play in the final third but we didn’t create enough clear-cut chances.”
Hughton’s counterpart Mauricio Pellegrino, said: “We did the most difficult thing. We were in front with an early goal. But when you let your opponent back into the game in this division, every single team has the quality to hurt you. Brighton are mentally very high right now. We played well but when you control the game you must play with more determination to score the second one and kill the game.”
Brighton are no longer everyone’s favourites for relegation after a solid start to the season was capped by last week’s eye-catching thumping of West Ham at the London Stadium. Southampton, for their part, are still perceived to be struggling for form. Indeed if you include Claude Puel’s time at the club, the jury has been out on the Saints for longer than the average fraud trial.
Goals are the main concern for both teams. Pellegrino’s side have scored nine in 10 games, Brighton just one more. The word dour has been applied to both sides this term, but it has always seemed a little harsh when applied to Hughton’s team, not just because every point scraped from solidity is one towards safety but also because they tend to play with an attacking four, including two wingers. Saints went 4-3-3 here but struggled to make an impact with Sofiane Boufal and Dusan Tadic nominally playing out wide but neither showing much appetite for it.
Boufal it was who set in motion the events that led to Southampton’s goal in the seventh minute. The foul he drew from Dale Stephens on the edge of the Brighton box wasn’t much of one, if indeed it was one at all, but Ward-Prowse made the most of the dubious advantage. Standing square of the ball the England international, making only his third league start of the season, took a minimal run up and drove his kick over the wall and off Mathew Ryan’s crossbar. Davis beat Shane Duffy to the rebound and scored with a bouncing header.
Brighton are not used to being broken open so quickly in matches. Equally they are not at their most comfortable when chasing a game. But in their doppelganger wingers, Anthony Knockaert and José Izquierdo, they had the game’s most effective performers.
With both men in tandem for just the second time, newly promoted Brighton’s attacking play was faster and more confident than in the opening weeks of the season. Izquierdo’s pace was a real threat while Knockaert had the cuteness of touch to find space in small pockets. Both made a talented Southampton back line work hard for their corn.
The scores became level seven minutes after the restart. When the ball came to Knockaert on the edge of the box, he had the presence of mind to lay it off to Pascal Gross who was waiting wide right. The German swung a deep cross to Murray who had peeled off his marker and used his height advantage over right back Cédric Soares to head past Fraser Forster at the near post. It was the German’s fifth league assist this season (one fewer than Kevin De Bruyne), and Murray’s third goal. Once again, however, there will be questions over Forster, whose positioning was suspect and reactions slow.
The match drained away as both coaches sought to affect minor change through tactical substitutions, the risk of losing everything greater than the chance of a win it seemed.
“It was unlucky because the ball deflected off Cedric and surprised the keeper“ Pellegrino said of the equaliser. Hughton, not surprisingly perhaps, took a different perspective. “It was an excellent header. There was only one place he could score and he put it right in that corner.”",0
"It seems a lot of us have trouble sleeping these days. My post on how to get a better sleep naturally has gotten really popular lately, so I wanted to share an unusual thingthat has helpedmy sleep lately – wearing orange sunglasses at night.
If you look at the research, it turns out that wearing silly glasses can serve a serious purpose!
There is a lot of research showing that blue light after sunset can disrupt circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin production. More recent studies showthat artificial light exposure at nighthas even more serious consequences.
Think about it, until the invention of electric light bulbs, people relied on the sun on the majority of their light. After dark, they onlyused natural sources of light like candles, campfires and lanterns (all orange lights). With the dawn of modern electricity, we suddenly had the ability to stay up with lights on for many hours after sunset.
With computers, TVs, tablets and phones, this use has extended even more, and these new technologies are especially high in blue light.
Electricity brought many benefits, but it also gave us the ability to mess with our circadian rhythm and our sleep cycles.
Researchers have known for years that shift workers and those who are regularly up late at night are at a higher risk for various cancers. More recent research shows that even recreational exposure to blue light for a few hours at night can have a negative effect.
Some researchers even promote the theory that the disruption of natural circadian rhythm from (blue) light after dark is a big contributing factor to the rise in obesity and chronic disease. There is even evidence linking this disruption of the sleep cycle to higher rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, and other cardiovascular problems.
But we do know that exposure to light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences circadian rhythms, and there’s some experimental evidence (it’s very preliminary) that lower melatonin levels might explain the association with cancer.
Shift workers and those up after 11 PM seem to be especially at risk for the negative effects of blue light.Researchis showing that any of us who are up after dark looking at sources of blue light (TV, computer, etc.) are at risk. Since my work day begins when my kids go to bed at 8, avoiding these things was not an option so I looked for another solution.
Turns out, there is a simple way to reduce most of the blue light we see at night: orange sunglasses.
While light of any kind can suppress the secretion of melatonin, blue light does so more powerfully. Harvard researchers and their colleagues conducted an experiment comparing the effects of 6.5 hours of exposure to blue light to exposure to green light of comparable brightness.
The blue light suppressed melatonin for about twice as long as the green light. Itshifted circadian rhythms by twice as much (3 hours vs. 1.5 hours).
In another study of blue light, researchers at the University of Toronto compared the melatonin levels of people exposed to bright indoor light who were wearing blue-light–blocking goggles to people exposed to regular dim light without wearing goggles.
The fact that the levels of the hormone were about the same in the two groups strengthens the hypothesis that blue light is a potent suppressor of melatonin. It also suggests that shift workers and night owls could perhaps protect themselves if they wore eyewear that blocks blue light.
It is important to note that blue light in itself is actually a very good thing. Exposure to blue light (preferably outdoors) is important during the day to maintain proper circadian rhythm. It is only blue light at night that causes the problems. At night, bluelight signals the body that it is still daytime (sunlight has a lot of blue light).
In fact, avoiding blue light during the day has been linked to depression and sleep troubles! It is important to get blue light, but only during the day when it benefits the body. I have a 10,000 lux light box (with blue light spectrum) that I use in the morning to help my cortisol rhythm for this reason.
Psychology Today explains the benefits of wearing blue-blocking sunglasses at night:
* “Astudyof 20 adults who wore either blue-light blocking or ultraviolet light blocking glasses for 3 hours before sleep found that both sleep quality and mood improved among those in the group who wore blue-light blocking glasses, compared to the ultraviolet light blocking group.
Shift workers are at especially high risk for circadian rhythm disruptions, because of their non-traditional schedules. In a study by scientists at Quebec’s Universite Laval, nightshift workersusedblue-light blocking glasses at or near the end of their overnight shifts for 4 weeks. At the end of study period, their overall sleep amounts increased, as did their sleep efficiency.”
Limit or avoid TV, computer, phone, etc after dark
If that isn’t possible or plausible, use orange sunglasses to help greatly reduce the blue light. I’m wearing these Uvex glasses in the picture above.They were inexpensive and effective (they also have one that fits over reading glasses). I’ve since switched to these official blue blocking glassesthat are slightly more stylish (and the ones you will see me in on video sometimes).
* Install an app like f.lux on computers and tablets. This automatically reduces blue light on these devices after dark.
* Dim overhead lights or just use lamps with orange bulbs after dark. Our favorite way to do this is by using salt lamps to light our house at night. Bonus: They also help clean the air.
* Exposure yourself to sunlight during the day. This canhelp keep your circadian rhythm in check and get some Vitamin D at the same time",1
"As an online retailer, you need to take very seriously some of the most common concerns that people have about online shopping. Here are just a few of those concerns, and some suggestions about how you can provide the reassurance your potential customers need to make their purchase on your site.
Security and privacy concerns are cited in a Department of Commerce Study as being why almost half of American internet users are reluctant to shop online. In light of the prominent data breeches and hacks of major internet sites in recent years, it is understandable that potential customers will have some reservations about proving sensitive information online. For that reason, you need to be sure that your site is as secure as it can be. Unless you have the right sort of tech savvy and the time to make sure that your site is regularly checked for vulnerabilities, it is worth getting professional assistance from a company like Sitelock. You can read some Sitelock reviews here to get a sense of the kind of service you should be looking for – including how to get a trust symbol on your website to assure your customers. More and more people are looking for such symbols, and this will go a long way towards giving your clients the peace of mind they need.
Many shoppers say that they prefer shopping in brick and mortar shops because any questions they might have about the product or process can be answered right away by a store associate. Your website might have an email for questions or support, but if people are forced to wait for a response to an emailed question, they might have already moved on before that answer arrives. What people prefer is the real-time support that they get in the traditional shop. For this reason, your site may benefit from adding live chat functionality to capture the 18-34 age group, and a toll free number to appeal to the 35 and over age group. Having some form of real-time assistance available on your site contributes to the sense that your business is “real” (addressing another common concern of reluctant online shoppers) and has been shown to increase conversions.
One of the biggest challenges that online retailers face is that people may be hesitant to pay in advance for a product that they might not like, that may not fit, or that is the wrong color or fabric. To address this concern, consider different ways to reduce the risk to your customer. There are any number of ways to do this – for example, free delivery on returns, a hassle-free return policy, “try before you buy” offers, and the provision of very detailed product information before purchase are just some of the more common strategies.
Online shopping is convenient and easy, and if you pay attention to the concerns that are raised by potential customers and address them, you can expect that more shoppers will be happy to make a purchase on your site.",1
"After receiving complaints that crosses on food product labels were offensive, a grocery store manager quickly removed them to appease those who took issue. However, as soon as a Christian heard about the store’s submission, he arrived with a brilliant surprise for the unsuspecting store employees.
As the Muslim population festers, their religious demands continue to grow louder and more burdensome. Unfortunately, appeasing them only gives way to stronger demands until they reach their ultimate goal of establishing Sharia law, as they’ve done in over 50 Muslim countries.
Expectedly, this tactic has made its way to the West with Muslims demanding that we accommodate their ceaseless religious compulsions, refraining from ever offending their hair-trigger sensibilities. As we become one step closer to implementing blasphemy laws, fed-up Westerners are beginning to rise up with a few demands of their own.
When the tiny Muslim minority whined about minuscule Christian symbols on food product packages, namely crosses, European supermarket giant Lidl hastily capitulated, airbrushing out every seemingly Christian symbol they came across.
Absurdly believing this would satisfy the unendingly offended Muslim community, the chain had no idea that they’d also offended the non-Muslim majority in the process. In fact, the store has hypocritically allowed Islamic minarets and crescent symbols to remain on halal food products. Fortunately, a bold Czech native was there to call out their bias in a brilliant way.
The Gateway Pundit reports that 37-year-old conservative activist Martin Zapletal and his companions arrived at 3 Lidl stores dressed as medieval monks and carrying 3-foot crucifixes to protest the franchise’s censorship of Christian symbols in favor of the Muslim supremacists. In a display that effectually mocked the store’s hypocrisy, Zapletal and several others quietly browsed the aisles, “blessing” each product that had been scrubbed of Christian symbolism.
Peacefully protesting the blatant religious censorship that directly complies with Sharia law, the group accumulated censored items in their carts and parked them at several checkout lanes before leaving.
“Yes, the crucifixes were real, and very old,” Zapletal explained to The Gateway Pundit, “but the costumes were improvised.”
“We in the Czech Republic like different kinds of humor. We’re known for that and we wanted to highlight what is a very serious issue – the censorship of Christian identity across Europe.”
Expectedly, the peaceful protest garnered the attention of the store manager, who threatened to call the police on the group for allegedly frightening customers and damaging merchandise. Knowing that they hadn’t committed any crime, Zaplatel simply continued with his demonstration, replying, “I am a citizen. I am a patriot. We must all take a stand against evil.”
“We’re at home here. Our rules apply. If anyone doesn’t like it, he can leave,” Zapletal continued from a small village near Olomouc, a university town in Eastern Bohemia Thursday morning.
“This goes far beyond the decisions of this one supermarket chain,” he stated, adding that large foreign populations are being invited into Europe to deliberately divide the continent, a project so advanced that conflict is already inevitable, he believes.
Incredibly, Zaplatel’s activism has been joined by thousands of offended non-Muslims who’ve inundated Lidl’s Facebook page with negative comments and vowed to boycott the chain. Shoppers in the Czech Republic, Belgium, and Germany have also threatened to never shop at the popular grocer again, according to Zero Hedge.
The massive outcry reached the ears of Lidl upper-management, causing the company to apologize for upsetting the majority of their consumers. However, the chain did nothing to remedy the situation and continues to sell censored products while Islamic foods proudly display their religious symbols. Oddly, the company alleged that they removed only Christian symbols in order to prevent the exclusion of customers of other faiths.
“We are avoiding the use of religious symbols because we do not wish to exclude any religious beliefs. We are a company that respects diversity and this is what explains the design of this packaging. Our intention has never been to shock,” said the supermarket’s spokesman. “We avoid the use of religious symbols on our packaging to maintain neutrality in all religions. If it has been perceived differently, we apologize to those who may have been shocked.”
Although offending Muslims is quickly becoming a punishable crime in the West, offending the Christian majority is widely considered acceptable, especially in an effort to appease the very vocal Islamic minority. So, while the corporate giant lets the world know how they feel about Christianity, hopefully, Christians, who account for the majority of their consumers, will let them know how they feel by shopping elsewhere.",1

"Unless you’re really lucky, sometime during your travels you will find yourself in a situation where an airline owes you something. Maybe it’s because of a delay, lost baggage, a rescheduled flight, whatever. When that day comes, the airline will almost surely try to settle by issuing you airline vouchers for future travel rather than cutting you a check. At worst, the airline loses the cost of the seat rather than the posted fare; at best, you’ll somehow not get around to using the airline voucher, and the carrier will face no cost at all.
To decrease their risk, airlines incorporate gotchas into vouchers to increase the chances that you won’t be able to use them. So before you accept any airline vouchers, you need to ask seven questions.
How long are the vouchers valid? A tight validity limit is one of the oldest voucher gotchas in the book. An airline offers a generous voucher, but you have to use it within six months. Clearly, many travelers are uninterested in or unable to schedule another flight within that short a time. This ploy is more prevalent with cruise lines than with airlines, but you still have to be careful.
Who can use it? Is the value of the travel voucher limited to you, or can you use it to buy a ticket for someone else? Many airline vouchers may be used only by the person who initially received it for his or her own travel. Depending on your flexibility, that might or might not be a deal-breaker.
Does it cover the whole price? Airline vouchers seldom include the full cost of a future trip; often, you must pay the government taxes and fees separately. But I’ve heard reports of a much worse limitation: an airline voucher covering only the “base” fare and not the very stiff “carrier-imposed fee,” essentially a renamed fuel surcharge, which on some airlines can be more than the base fare.
More: 8 tips to make the most of your next flight
Do you get just one bite? Some vouchers are valid for only a single transaction, even when the value of that transaction is less than the face value of the voucher. For example, if you use a $500 airline voucher to buy a $400 ticket, you might not be able to use the remaining $100 for second ticket. Instead, you lose that value outright.
Are there any fare limitations? I haven’t seen much of this one, but an airline could place some fare buckets off-limits to voucher-based tickets—not applicable to “flash sale” prices, for example, or for business class.
How much are vouchers to you? Given the limitations on how you can use it, a voucher is effectively worth a lot less to you than its face cash value. Many experts estimate that a voucher is worth somewhere between a third and a half of its face value. If you ask for cash but an airline offers a voucher, take the voucher only if the face value is at least double the cash offer. When cash isn’t an option, if the voucher value seems to be inadequate, bargain for more or consider your alternatives.
Can you get cash instead? When a flight is oversold, an airline almost always resorts to offering travel vouchers to passengers who agree to get off and take a later flight. Usually, that works, and someone takes the offer. But if nobody bites, and the airline has to select someone to get off, government regulations specify cash payments, not vouchers, for “involuntary” bumping. You can get up to $675 in the U. S., depending on the circumstance, but only in the case of overbooking. European rules call for higher payments as well as payments for delays. Take the voucher only if its worth to you is a lot more than the cash.

"A San Francisco based, synthetic bio hacker group has made hundreds of headlines for creating cheese without the use of cows. Young bio hackerspace people fromBioCurious and Counter Culture Labs make up the group.
They beat out 243 other groups to take first place at this year’s iGEM “jamboree” competition. iGEM stands for international genetically engineered machine. The winner’s groupfundraiser brought nearly $40,000 from donors – over double the amount they needed. They claim to have approval from many vegans, without the anticipated anti-GMO backlash.
Interestingly, they have dubbed the product ‘Real Vegan Cheese’ because they claim that other vegan cheese-like foods are merely substitutes.
Genetically engineered bakers yeast is inserted with DNA strands, some of them human – to cut down on allergies they said – to make the yeast into a “milk” protein creating factory. But no actual mammal DNA is used. The yeast stays behind for the end product.They say: “To create our proteins, we study animal genomes, choose milk-protein genetic sequences, and synthesize those genes.”
Plus the purified proteins will be identical to those found in regular cheese, and will not contain any GMO!
The New Yorker explains what synthetic bio hackers are about and how they differentiate themselves from other genetic engineers:
At the core of the Jamboree wasa discipline called synthetic biology. Whereas developers of genetically modified organisms—herbicide-resistant soybeans, carotene-enriched rice, faster-growing salmon—tweak a plant or an animal’s DNA with genes borrowed from elsewhere in nature,synthetic biologists assemble new gene sequences from scratch.The science has attracted a good deal less press than G. M.O.s, but it has already moved beyond the lab. [emphasis added]
iGEM wants to foster undergraduates into applying systematic biotech, using engineering andbiological parts to operate in living cells. An alchemy of sorts.
The group says they are independent, open source, non-profit and base their actions off of a love for the environment. They disarm public scrutiny by inviting questions, even critical ones, and attempting to foster transparency. They claim they don’t want to change the conversation on synthetic biology, but rather take an inviting approach and quell fears of safety aimed at their project. The invitation for people to get involved is offered to replace the question of should scientists andcompaniesbe allowed to do“X”? In other words, the acceptance of synthetic biology will happen as a result of public participation and engagement.
During their iGEM presentation, they were asked about the legitimacy of doing something justbecause we can, as they stated. The man asked them to reframe the idea and say if you should. While not as vague as responding “why not?” they reiterated a love for the environment, animal rights, encouraging a plant-based diet and teaching the public. Perhaps the gentleman asking meant – why this? Is there not a better way to solve the inconvenience of vegan fare and the environment aside from synthetic biology, i.e. using the human genome?
As for other safety concerns, they disregarded any claims to casein protein, or, their casein micelles being a precursor to cancer.
This is not the first project to create a food, or a sort-of human-based food under the auspices of “sustainability.” There are Bill Gates’ vegan, plant-basedeggs. Genetically engineered cows that produce human breast milk (I guess cows are still useful for something). Test tube meat. Do you see a pattern? For starters, it’s the idea that the naturally-born counterparts are inherently “bad” and that we should get used to a world without them.
While they claim it’s not an actual GMO with no DNA or GE ingredients remaining, some people find it unsettling to eat human protein-derived food products. Comparisons to the “zombie” craze and Soylent Greenare surfacing. The zombie trend has prompted restaurants to try for burgers made to taste and feel like human flesh– sort of the inverse of using the actual human DNA blueprint to create cheese.We also do a lot of “recycling” of ourselves already. For instance, the use of our own sewage to fertilize crops. The practice has been called “biosolids” since the 1990s to make the idea more – ahem – palatable to the public.
Since some people will not accept the human-derived milk protein, they are also creating “good ol’ fashioned” cow protein-derived vegan cheese – imagine that…
Since the group is working closely with the FDA on legal guidelines, it is very likely their project will come to fruition – it’s just a matter of when. It’s still “a work in progress.”",1

Black woman writes about getting a gun for protection. NY Times readers don't like that one bit.
Black woman writes about getting a gun for protection. NY Times readers don’t like that one bit.
Antonia Okafor is a black woman who wrote about wanting a gun for protection in a New York Times op-ed. But readers didn't like that at all. (Image source: YouTube screenshot)
During her first year of graduate school at the University of Texas, Dallas, she wrote in a New York Times op-ed that she worked during the day and took all her classes at night.
“Every evening, after class got out around 10, I had to walk through the sprawling parking lots to get to my car,” Okafor explained. “I dreaded that time of day. I would pray that no one was lurking in dimly lit areas or behind cars, and I’d try not to think about the campus police alerts I’d seen about sexual assaults in the area.”
What’s more, she said she was assaulted as a child — which left her “acutely aware of the realities of being preyed upon just because you are physically smaller and less likely to protect yourself. I know what it means to feel defenseless.”
“Now my only means of protection was a rape whistle,” Okafor said. “I would hold it in one hand and my phone in the other, the numbers 9-1-1 pre-dialed and my finger on the call button. As I neared my car, I would start to jog. It scared me to think that even if I dialed the number and blew the whistle, by the time anyone got to the scene it might be too late. When I got to my car, I’d get in, lock the doors and look behind me to make sure no one was in the back seat.”
And around the time the Texas Legislature was debating the campus-carry bill in 2015 — which it eventually passed — Okafor said she began advocating for the right of students to carry concealed and soon became the Southwest director of Students for Concealed Carry. All despite coming from a Democratic household and never having been a “gun enthusiast.”
“But from the minute I put my hands around a Ruger LC9 pistol, the gun I regularly carry with me now, I felt more in control,” she continued. “I felt empowered to be holding a tool that could protect me physically, and I was determined to learn how to use it responsibly. It was a relief to know that I could shoot if I had to, even though I would never use my gun unless it was a last means of self-defense. I got my concealed carry license a year ago.”
Okafor added that she regularly comes across “liberals who fear irresponsible gun use and think that college kids (even if they are 21) can’t be trusted with firearms.”
Worse yet, Okafor wrote that “many liberals … don’t support a woman’s ‘right to choose’ when it comes to her own self-defense,” adding that “I fiercely resent being told that I can’t protect myself according to my rights as an American.”
“Contrary to popular belief, there is a place for young, pro-Second Amendment women in modern feminism,”she concluded. “And there is a place for them on college campuses.”

And wouldn’t you know Times readers took issue with Okafor’s stance?
“Yet another argument for guns that relies on emotions, not facts,” one reader commented. “You are not, statistically, safer with a gun … Guns pose an embarrassing public safety risk, exacerbated by concealed carry. Your argument lacks rigor. The Texas law in question is a travesty, and should be overturned as soon as possible.”
Another asked, “Why carry a gun instead of pepper spray, which will incapacitate an attacker but is not lethal and not a danger to innocent bystanders?”
“As a black person the author should be careful what she wishes for,” another commenter declared. “Just as with drugs, if things go wrong with a gun (and every day you can read articles that show very clearly that they do and will), blacks will be the first to be severely punished. Blacks continue to be stereotyped as violent, and she’s not helping.”
Yet another dissenting commenter added, “This young woman most likely has the best of intentions, but it sounds like extensive psychotherapy and trauma therapy is what is needed, not the false sense of security that comes with carrying a firearm.”
But not every reader was bothered by Okafor’s piece.
“With gun control, would be rapists and other non-law-abiding citizens would still be able to gain access to firearms while law-abiding citizens would be left defenseless,” one observed. “Gun control only takes firearms out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.”
The best reply may have been from a “a middle-aged, liberal, and gun-hating white male. As far as I’m concerned, there’s no demographic that deserves wide rights to bear firearms more than black women. I totally support you, Ms. Okafor.”
Here’s Okafor speaking about the issue on a video for TheBlaze:

"South Korea have claimed that North Korea are preparing to conduct another underground nuclear test, in a bid to escalate tensions with the UN and international community.
Seoul’s intelligence agency warned that Pyongyang is preparing its fifth nuclear test, just one day after it fired a long-range ballistic missile.
In its previous nuclear test, on 6 January, North Korea detonated what it says was a hydrogen bomb, but international experts have rejected that suggestion.
Pyongyang’s latest provocations have been met with unanimous condemnation – even from allies China and Russia long ago – but a new nuclear test actually demonstrate what the regime of Kim Jong-un, thought to criticism.
Immediately after the missile launch Sunday, South Korea put its forces on high alert for any alleged threat from the North.
At a meeting of the National Security Council on Sunday, Park Geun-hye, the president of South Korea, said: “The security of South Korea and its people are in danger, since no one knows the irresponsible provocations North Korea will.
Shortly after dawn on Monday, a North Korean patrol boat crossed the maritime border off the west coast of the Korean peninsula. South Korean vessel fired several warning shots before the warship through the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea was withdrawn.
Meeting in New York on Sunday, the Security Council of the UN strongly condemned the North Korean decision to ignore previous UN resolutions and international public opinion and move on with missile launch Sunday morning.
Describing the launch as a “serious violation” Rafael Dario Ramirez Carreno, the ambassador of Venezuela and President of the Council this month, said: “Members of the Security Council strongly condemned the launch.”
Flanked by his Japanese and South Korean counterparts, Samantha Power, the US ambassador, he added: “We will ensure that the Security Council imposes serious consequences (North Korea) past transgressions of the DPRK require our response even stronger. “.
North Korea insists that the vehicle was a rocket designed to put an observation satellite orbiting Earth and has a sovereign right to explore and exploit space.
Critics say the rockets share the almost identical technology long-range missiles and that the resolutions of the United Nations explicitly prohibited Pyongyang of conducting such testing dual-use starts with the argument that they are helping North Korean scientists to refine their weapons and marry them for a warhead.
Strengthening the belief that the pitch was a disguised missile test, South Korea has described the satellite was launched into orbit as “worthless.
The satellite weighs about 440 pounds, it becomes twice the weight of the satellite that North Korea launched in 2012, according to the National Intelligence Service of South Korea. A functional satellite usually weighing 1,700 pounds, according to the agency.
South Korea opened talks with the US on the distribution of missile batteries High Altitude Area Defense Terminal to counter the threat posed by North Korean missiles, although China has reacted angrily to the plan.
The Chinese government summoned the ambassador to South Korea on Sunday to protest against Seoul request missile system.
China fears creeping influence in South Korea the United States, but Seoul insists it has the right to decide their own security measures when the lives of its citizens are threatened.",1
"eetroot can be a bit divisive. Depending on how you look at it, its deep purple colour is bold and beautiful or, quite literally, a bleeding nuisance. Its smell and earthy taste are just as controversial: “It tastes of soil,” say those who think that’s a bad thing. “It tastes of soil,” say those who think it’s a good thing.
Predictably, I side with the latter. I love beetroot, because it tastes of the earth and its colour makes total sense at this time of the year. What I’d love even more, though, is for its range and versatility to be more accepted, so it was less divisive in the first place. Purple beetroot are still the most widely available, but look out for other varieties, too: the pretty pink-and-white-striped ones, say, or golden bulbs that carry much less potential to stain.
There’s also a huge range size-wise, and those earthy notes become more pronounced the bigger the bulb gets. If that taste of soil puts you off, use baby bulbs, which have spent so much less time in the earth that they’re yet really to smell of it.
And that’s just the beginning. What you can do with your bulbs is even more versatile. Today, I’m showcasing just three of the many directions in which beetroot can be taken: grated raw and baked in a bread, as you might carrots or parsnips; roasted whole, to draw out that natural sweetness; and, for those not shy about the matter, a stew that highlights just how bold this wonderful vegetable can be.
Keep the leaves and stems of your baby vegetables attached, if you can, because they make the finished dish look much prettier. It also means you can use the stems as handles when dipping the veg in the yoghurt (this is definitely one to eat with your hands). The trick is to get the cooking times right for each vegetable (those provided are only guidelines, and will vary according to size): you want them cooked until soft, but still retaining their texture. Serves eight.
1 whole head garlic
3 tbsp olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
450g baby beetroot, washed, stalks and leaves attached, if possible
500g baby turnips, washed, stalks and leaves attached, if possible
400g baby carrots, washed, stalks and leaves attached, if possible
500g baby leeks, washed and trimmed
300g Greek-style yoghurt
1 tbsp sumac, plus a pinch to serve
Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Cut the top quarter off the garlic head, and discard. Put the garlic in a double layer of aluminium foil, pour a teaspoon and a half of oil and a pinch of salt over the cut side, then wrap securely. Bake for 35 minutes until caramelised and soft, then leave to cool down.
While the garlic is roasting, get on with the vegetables. Trim the beetroot to leave at least 4cm-long stalks on each, and do the same with the turnips and carrots (if you like, toss the trimmed leaves in extra oil, roast them alongside the veg for the final five minutes and add to the finished dish). Mix the trimmed veg in a large bowl with the leeks, two tablespoons of oil, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Pull out the beetroot and turnips and put on a large oven tray lined with baking paper. Roast for 10 minutes, then add the carrots to the tray and roast for another eight minutes, then remove the tray from the oven. Meanwhile, spread out the leeks on a second large oven tray lined with baking paper and roast for seven minutes, until just cooked and starting to colour, then remove from the oven and leave to cool.
While the veg are cooling, in a small bowl, mix the yoghurt with a tablespoon of oil, the sumac and a pinch of salt, then sprinkle over the extra pinch of sumac.
Squeeze the caramelised garlic flesh from its skin into a large bowl and mash with a fork. Tip in all the freshly roasted vegetables, warm or at room temperature, tossing everything gently so it all gets a coating of the garlic, then arrange on a large platter: group each type of veg separately on the platter, or leave them mixed up. Serve with the sumac yoghurt on the side.
All this needs is a bowl of plain rice alongside. Serves four.
1kg boneless beef shin, cut into roughly 6cm square chunks
Salt
60ml olive oil
6 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
4 shallots, peeled and cut into 0.5cm-thick slices
3 bay leaves
3-4 oranges – shave the peel of 1 into four wide strips, then juice them all to get 400ml
500g beetroot, peeled and cut into 4cm chunks
500ml beef stock
1 litre water
1 tbsp tomato paste
 dried habanero chilli
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp ground cinnamon
Season the beef with a teaspoon of salt. On a medium-high flame, heat half the oil in a large, 28cm-diameter, heavy-based saucepan for which you have a lid. Brown the beef in two or three batches, making sure the pieces are spaced well apart, for seven minutes, turning regularly so they colour on all sides, then remove the meat from the pan.
Leave any juices in the pan and add the remaining two tablespoons of oil, the garlic, shallots, bay leaves, orange peel and half a teaspoon of salt. Saute for about four minutes, stirring from time to time, until the onions are soft and golden, then add the beetroot and fry for another four minutes, stirring occasionally, before returning the beef to the pan. Pour over the beef stock, orange juice and water, and add the tomato paste, habanero and ground spices. Bring to a boil, turn down the heat to medium, cover and cook for two to two and a half hours, until the meat is very soft and starting to fall apart and the sauce is nice and thick. (If you’re using a smaller pot, you may need to reduce the sauce further to get the right consistency: you’re looking for about 350ml of thick sauce at the end.)
Serve on rice and top with a spoonful of soured cream, a sprinkle of coriander, if using, and a wedge of lime for squeezing over on the side.
This savoury beetroot bread has a cakey texture, and is best eaten spread with lots of salted butter, rather than for making sandwiches. It will keep well in an airtight container for a week. Makes one loaf, or enough for about 10 slices.
50g rolled oats
10g thyme leaves, finely chopped
50g pumpkin seeds
2 tsp caraway seeds
2 tsp nigella seeds
100g plain flour
100g wholemeal flour
2 tsp baking powder
 tsp bicarbonate of soda
Salt
2 raw beetroots, peeled and finely grated (200g net weight)
2 large eggs
80ml sunflower oil
80g soured cream
1 tbsp honey
20g parmesan, finely grated
120g good goat’s cheese (I used Rosary), roughly broken into 2cm pieces
Heat the oven to 175C/345F/gas mark 3, and grease and line the base of a 20cm x 10cm loaf tin.
In a small bowl, mix the oats, thyme, pumpkin, caraway and nigella seeds in a small bowl, then spoon out one tablespoon’s worth on to a small plate.
In a large bowl, mix the flours, baking powder, bicarb and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Whisk to combine and aerate, then add the beetroot and the oat and seed mix in the bowl, but don’t stir it together.
In a second bowl, whisk the eggs, oil, soured cream, honey and parmesan. Tip in the flour and beetroot mixture, and mix in with a spatula until thoroughly combined, then gently fold in the goat’s cheese, so as not to break it up as you go.
Pour the batter into the prepared tin, then sprinkle the reserved tablespoon of oats and seeds on top. Bake for 40 minutes, cover tightly with foil, then bake for 40 minutes more, by which time a skewer inserted into the centre of the loaf should come out not completely clean, but not too wet, either. Remove the tin from the oven, remove the foil and leave to cool for five minutes. Tip out the loaf on to a wire rack, turn it back over so it’s seed side up, and leave to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing.

"The term adrenal fatigue refers to the condition in which the adrenal glands have difficulties with dealing with stress and busy schedule. In such a condition, you are likely to feel dull, overworked, and extremely fatigued.
Although adrenal fatigue cannot be diagnosed by your doctor, the warning signals below indicate that there is something wrong which needs to be addressed as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, most people neglect self-care and fail to pay attention to their health until it becomes too late. It is very important to try out certain self-care practices, which are essential for your success. In other words, you need to move away from anything that doesn’t serve you, and focus on self-care practices instead.
The body needs 8-10 hour of sleep each night, which is the time it takes to reset, recover, and recharge. However, most people fail to get enough sleep which eventually throws off your balance. It`s high time you changed this by introducing a new, healthy habit.
Be in bed by 10:30, even if you have trouble falling asleep. To relax your body, practice some meditation or take a warm bath with added AlkaBath.
3. You Feel Exhausted After Working Out
Did you know that exercise should make you feel energized, instead of feeling fatigued and exhausted? Too much exercise can do the opposite and you may end up with additional stress on your adrenal glands.
In case you are exercising on a regular basis, but are still not achieving the wanted results and are struggling with abdominal fat, swap your exercise routine for more gentle forms like yoga, walking, and stretching.
The thyroid may be affected during the second stage of adrenal fatigue, which may lead to symptoms like poor circulation, weight gain, dry hair, fatigue, and dry hair and skin. When the adrenal glands gave difficulties coping with stress levels, the hormone precursor steps in. This eventually leads to hormone imbalance.
The symptoms of a hormone imbalance, such as increased PMS symptoms and irregular cycle are highly unpleasant. To fight them back, eliminate caffeine, drink plenty of water, follow a nourishing diet, get enough rest, and add adaptogenic herbs into your diet.
Adrenal hormones affect cognitive function, mood, and mental stress. The pressure of a busy schedule may lead to an adrenaline rush and thus affect the functions above.
Both anxiety and depression are directly linked to stress, which means that we are less tolerant and much more frustrated. So, take time for YOU and try out some self-care practices.
Cravings for salt are very common drawback of hormonal imbalance, mostly due to the fact that the body looks for sodium and other minerals. When the production of salt-retaining hormone is reduced, you are likely to crave salty snacks and experience heart palpitations, dizziness, and low blood pressure.
Make sure you get enough minerals by using seaweeds like kelp and dulse, adding mineral drops to your water, or using a high quality Himalayan pink salt in your cooking.
Feeling stiff and sore is one of the most common signs of adrenal fatigue and the most common reaction to stressful events. You may feel stress in the back, jaw, or the neck! To fight this back, improve your sleep habits, try out yoga or meditation, and enjoy a warm, relaxing bath using blends like AlkaBath.
8. You’re Relying on Caffeine to Get You Through the Afternoon
Coffee doesn’t give you energy, but rather lends it to you. Although caffeine helps you get through the day by working as stimulant, it also affects your adrenal glands and keeps the body in stress mode. Although mornings can be difficult when you have adrenal fatigue, coffee drinker should understand that the initial energy they get from caffeine wears off and they end up feeling even more fatigued. Reach for herbal teas and coffee substitutes instead!
9. Your Digestion is Off
When you are under stress, your digestion is off and you fail to get the most of the food you eat. This is completely normal reaction since functions like metabolism and digestion are downregualted in adrenal fatigue mode. It is very likely that you will experience diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, bloating, and weight gain.
The solution lies in following a nourishing diet and Recharge supplementation like drinking lemon water, drinking plenty of water, getting enough minerals, taking a probiotic, and taking time to savor your meals.",1

I just read an article by, I think someone named Armstrong. This guy is predicting there will be bloodshed before this is over.  The left is crazy, and the Democrats are doing nothing to defuse the situation. The problem, as I see it, is those of us here on OPP are too old to be of much physical help. If, however, it becomes a shooting civil war, then perhaps we could be of some use. Those who are younger and willing to help, unlike the professional protesters, have jobs to protect and can't just leave the job to counter protest. It was also mentioned that teachers are letting students out of class to protest. These kids aren't old enough to vote and have no idea even what the issues are. Also, the left is following the tactics of the brownshirts of Germany, whose method of operation was to interrupt meetings they considered a threat.

Why?  Seriously, why bother?  They're doing a great job of fighting themselves.  Every time a group of them gets together they embarrass themselves.

What's not to like?  I for one have no desire to go out into the cold, wet, winter streets and engage these morons.

Dear Heloise: What is the difference between a yam and a sweet potato?   Nora P.: Sweet potatoes usually are sweeter than yams. Yams are starchier. Sweet potatoes contain calcium, iron, protein, beta carotene, sodium, vitamin A and more sugar and water than yams. Yams have more fiber, potassium and vitamins C, B-6 and E than sweet potatoes, but also more fats and carbs. Sweet potatoes are believed to have come from Central or South America, while yams are believed to have originated in Africa and Asia. West Africa is still where the majority of yams are grown. Sweet potatoes are readily available in most grocery stores, while yams usually are more available in international markets. There are two main varieties of sweet potatoes in the United States and Canada. One is pink-skinned and orange on the inside; the other is golden-skinned and white on the inside. With yams, the outer skins usually are dark-brown or light-pink. The insides can be pink, white, yellow or purple.  Dear Heloise: You had a marinade for lamb that my husband really liked. It not only improved the flavor of the meat, it helped reduce the cooking odor in the house. Sadly, I lost it when we downsized to a new home. Would you reprint that recipe?   Nancy H: Yes. The lamb marinade also is great for beef and veal. So, here is your recipe:          Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and use as you would a commercial marinade. If you like this marinade, you will love my pamphlet Seasonings, Sauces and Substitutes. To get a copy, send a stamped (70 cents), self-addressed, business-size envelope, along with $3, to: Heloise/Seasonings, P. O. Box 795001, San Antonio, TX 78279-5001. Remember, you can only use a marinade once. This prevents cross-contamination of bacteria, which in turn can cause illness.  Dear Heloise: Chips and snacks are now packaged in huge bags! Sometimes I’m afraid to open them — I don’t want the seam to split. I’ve found that putting a piece of tape all the way around the bag just under the opening prevents the bag from splitting.   Dear Heloise: I store almost-empty jars of jelly, mayonnaise, relish, etc., on their sides. It’s easier and takes less time to dispense when the product is close to the jar opening.   Dear Heloise: I’ve found that those empty potato-chip tubes make fine “trash cans” for the car. They fit into the cup holders, and when full, you can replace the lid and discard.

"Convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein hasserved legal papers to an alternative media website in order to stopthem from publishing details surroundinga case involving sex trafficking.
In January, Mike Cernovich of Cernovich Mediafiled a motion to intervene in Giuffre v. Maxwell – a case involving a sex trafficking victim and an accused sex trafficker.
A woman who claimed that New York financier Jeffrey Epstein trafficked her for sex when she was a teenager may pursue a lawsuit accusing British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell of defamation for calling her allegations lies, a U. S. judge ruled.
In a decision on Monday night, U. S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan denied Maxwell’s request to dismiss Virginia Giuffre’s lawsuit.
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a 70-page motion for summary judgment with the court under seal. As the civil lawsuit is a public proceeding, the case should never have been sealed.
Cernovich Media retained leading first amendment attorney Marco Randazza to represent the interests of the public and the many readers and listeners of Cernovich Media.
The courts belong to the people, not the parties. The First Amendment demands that court proceedings be open to the public. How can a free press do its job in keeping a watchful eye over the workings of government if those workings are sealed?
In a desperate attempt to keep thepublic from learning about the wrongdoings by high level government officials in relation to pedophilia and trafficking, Epstein has filed a motion to “quash”Cernovich’s lawsuit.
In a plot twist fitting of a Kafka novella, the entire motion is redacted.
I can’t tell you what this motion claims, nor can I defend myself in court against these secret charges.
My due process rights are being violated, as it’s impossible for me to respond to this motion, as I don’t know what’s it in and cannot read what accusations pedophile Epstein has made. Here is another excerpt.
As my free speech lawyer Marc Randazza said:
There is a First Amendment right of access to judicial proceedings. We don’t have secret trials. You use the people’s courts, you do it in public. This entire case seems infected with an air of secrecy that is constitutionally unconscionable. When you look at this document, and Ms. Giuffre’s filings, where not even a single word is open to the public? Even documents from the CIA that have national security implications are less redacted than this. The people have a right to know how their courts are being used.
How can the judge allow this?
Why is heafraid of me?",1

There is no denying that our climate is rapidly changing at the hands of human intervention, and that the earth is entering an environmental crisis. The need for more pro-environment countries, cities, homes, and systems is at an all-time high and requires the immediate, focused attention of everyone, from the world’s leaders, to businesses, right down to each individual citizen.
One of the major ways people can enact change is through the production of energy. Avant Garde Innovations is the latest new startup out of India to do just that: they have created an innovative new wind turbine that is affordable and suitable for residential, commercial, agricultural, and rural settings.
AVANT GARDE INNOVATIONS IS CHANGING THE RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY
When you think of a wind turbine, you probably picture a giant, noisy, industrial turbine – the type most of us see when driving past an open field. Unfortunately, till date they have proven to be expensive and haven’t been able to really put a dent into the energy sector. That is, until now. Avant Garde Innovations have created a new type of wind turbine that produces clean energy at a fraction of the cost of traditional turbines, making clean energy affordable for everyone, businesses and residential areas alike.
Their goal, as stated on their website is as follows:
“eliminate energy poverty, reduce dependence on struggling state power grids and create energy self sufficiency for all the needy ones through distributed, localised and affordable renewable energy. In doing so, we believe we can collectively usher in our world a cleaner environment, new economic prosperity and social change.”
Currently with branches in India and Australia, Avant Garde Innovations is quickly gaining global attention for their focus not just on environmental sustainability, but also economic sustainability and accessibility. They believe that clean energy must be accessible to all people in order to effectively impact the environment.
A LOW COST RENEWABLE ENERGY OPTION FOR THE EVERY DAY FAMILY
The Avant Garde wind turbine is small, only about the size of a ceiling fan. It has the ability to produce 5 kilowatts of power each day, enough to power a single home for a lifetime. A family can purchase one for a one-time fee of $750. To compare, traditional home wind turbines generate only 1 kilowatt of energy and can cost anywhere from $4000 USD to $10,000 USD. Avant Garde has taken something formerly inaccessible and made sustainable energy a possibility for all. (1, 2)
Currently, the turbines are available in only India and Australia, but the start up has big hopes for future expansion into other countries, including North America.
STEPS YOU CAN TAKE NOW TOWARDS CLEAN ENERGY
Installing a home wind turbine is not a feasible option for most people given the current price tag, however there are many other sustainable practices you can follow to do your part towards healing the environment.
Solar Panels: Installing solar panels on the roof of your home is another excellent renewable energy choice. Solar panels can be used to power your home, heat your pool, and plenty more.
Electric Cars: If you are in the market for a new car, consider switching to an electric model. Though at first electric cars were only available in higher end vehicles, more affordable economy cars are now available, making them a more feasible option for the general public.
Unplug appliances that aren’t in use: Certain appliances with screens that continually use small amounts of electricity, even while not in use, can add up over time. Items such as toaster ovens, some coffee makers, even microwaves don’t necessarily need to plugged in 24/7.
Electricity Usage Tracking App: Considering downloading one of these phone apps that helps you to track your energy usage. These apps will show you what appliances in your home are using the most energy, help you find ways to cut back on usage, and also help you track cost and how much money you are spending and could be saving by cutting back.
Help us spread the word about this incredible new company and their technology by sharing this article with your friends and family. By supporting them, you are supporting the right to clean energy for every family in America and the rest of the world.

"The Trump administration is exploring ways to replace the use of Social Security numbers as the main method of assuring people’s identities in the wake of consumer credit agency Equifax Inc.’s massive data breach.
The administration has called on federal departments and agencies to look into the vulnerabilities of employing the identifier tied to retirement benefits, as well as how to replace the existing system, according to Rob Joyce, special assistant to the president and White House cybersecurity coordinator.
“I feel very strongly that the Social Security number has outlived its usefulness,” Joyce said Tuesday at a cyber conference in Washington organized by the Washington Post.“Every time we use the Social Security number, you put it at risk.”
Joyce’s comments came as former Equifax CEO Richard Smith testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the first of four hearings this week on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers from both parties expressed outrage over the size of the breach as well as the company’s response and grilled Smith on the timeline of the incident, including when top executives learned about it.
Smith said the rising number of hacks involving Social Security numbers have eroded its security value.
“The concept of a Social Security number in this environment being private and secure -- I think it’s time as a country to think beyond that,” Smith said. “What is a better way to identify consumers in our country in a very secure way? I think that way is something different than an SSN, a date of birth and a name.”
Joyce said officials are looking into “what would be a better system” that utilizes the latest technologies, including a “modern cryptographic identifier,” such as public and private keys.

“It’s a flawed system that we can’t roll back that risk after we know we’ve had a compromise,” he said. “I personally know my Social Security number has been compromised at least four times in my lifetime. That’s just untenable.”
Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, said one possibility could be giving individuals a private key, essentially a long cryptographic number that’s embedded in a “physical token” that then requires users to verify that the number belongs to them. It could work like the chip in a credit card that requires the owner to enter a pin allowing use. He pointed to Estonia where they have deployed such cards that people use to validate their identity.
“Your pin unlocks your ability to use that big number,” he said. The challenge is how to create the identifiers and how to distribute the keys. “It’s very promising” and “it’s possible to technically design something like this” but it could be expensive to design and disseminate such material to each American, he said. “This is a pretty big endeavor.”
The administration is also participating in discussions Congress is having about the requirements of protecting personal data and breach notifications for companies.
“It’s really clear, there needs to be a change, but we’ll have to look at the details of what’s being proposed,” Joyce said. In the response to the Equifax hack, though, he said, “we need to be careful of Balkanizing the regulations. It’s really hard on companies today” facing local, state and federal regulators as well as international rules, he added.
The U. S. government began issuing Social Security numbers in 1936. Nearly 454 million different numbers have been issued, according to the Social Security Administration. Supplanting such an ingrained apparatus would not happen over night. The original intent was to track U.S. workers’ earning to determine their Social Security benefits. But the rise of computers, government agencies and companies found new uses for the number, which gradually grew into a national identifier.
Over the decades, the Social Security number became valuable for what could be gained by stealing it, said Bruce Schneier, a fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.It was the only number available to identify a person and became the standard used for everything from confirming someone at the doctor’s office to school.
“They appeared at an age when we didn’t have other numbers,” Schneier said in an interview. “Think of this as part of our aging infrastructure” from roads and bridges to communications. “Sooner or later we as a society need to fix our aging infrastructure.”
He pointed to India’s wide-scale rollout of the Aadhaar card,a unique number provided to citizens after collecting their biometric information -- fingerprints and an iris scan -- along with demographic details, to almost 1.2 billion people. In the U. S., a more secure system could be designed, “but magic math costs money,” he said.
Making any changes to the current system, including replacing numbers entirely or restricting who can use them, would likely require an act of Congress, according to Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, which advocates for limiting the use of Social Security numbers.
“You’d need to change a lot of existing public law,"" Rotenberg said. “There would need to be extensive hearings and study about the consequences. It’s a complicated issue.""
The government’s own record of protecting Social Security numbers has its blemishes. Medicare, the federal health-care program for senior citizens, has long used the numbers on identification cards recipients must carry. After years of criticism by the agency’s inspector general for the risks that creates, new cards with different numbers are currently being rolled out.
The failure of the Social Security number is that there’s only one for each person, “once it’s compromised one time, you’re done,” Bob Stasio, a fellow at the Truman National Security Project and former chief of operations at the National Security Agency’s Cyber Operations Center.
Public and private keys -- long strings of code -- could help validate identities. For instance, the government could issue each person a public key and private key. If people were to open a bank account, for instance, they could provide their public key -- instead of a Social Security number -- and the bank would send a message that could only be decrypted using their private key. If the private key gets compromised, the government could easily issue another one.
Stasio also cited emerging blockchain technology as another potential tool. It could create a kind of digital DNA fingerprint that’s “mathematically impossible” to duplicate. In place of a Social Security number, each person could receive a blockchain hash -- a kind of algorithm unique to an individual -- that is stamped on every digital transaction or action.
That type of technology “could be used as a much more efficient and mathematically sound method of transaction, identification and validation,” Stasio said.
While lawmakers were unanimous in criticizing Equifax’s response to a breach that compromised information on 145.5 million U. S. consumers, they were divided on how to fix the underlying issue. Democrats on the panel have reintroduced legislation imposing requirements for when companies have to report data breaches, while Oregon Republican Greg Walden noted the company’s human errors, saying “you can’t fix stupid.”
Smith said the Equifax employee responsible for communicating that the vulnerable software needed to be patched didn’t do so. That failure was compounded when a scan of the company’s systems didn’t find that the vulnerability still existed, the former CEO said.
Joyce’s comments helped take some of the focus off Equifax’s blunders, analysts at Cowen Inc. said in a note Tuesday.
The “White House may be indirectly coming to Equifax’s rescue,” they wrote. “This reduces the risk of business-model-busting legislation such as a requirement that consumers opt-in to a credit bureau collecting their data.”

Ready to make a soothing muscle rub for back pain that is natural and free from chemicals?
Well, great. Today I am going to share with you a homemade soothing muscle rub that is easy and fairly quick to make at home. Many of these things you may already have in your kitchen. And the few you don’t, you can easily find at a natural food store or coop.
Now you may be wondering why cayenne would be the main ingredient for a muscle and joint rub. Great question!
Why Cayenne Works for Muscle Pain
Capsaicin, one of cayenne’s active constituents stimulates the release of something known as “substance P” in the body. Substance P is released from nerve cells and the inflammatory cells of the immune system. Substance P is most noted for its role in helping the body perceive pain and in stimulating the release of various cytokines to induce a healthy inflammatory response.
Cayenne also dilates blood vessels, which allows for more anti-inflammatory cells to make their way to the affected area. When substance P is released and subsequently depleted, as is the case when you repeatedly apply cayenne, the threshold of pain in that area increases. This is also known as pain desensitization. 1,2
What happens is the area actually feels less painful. This allows you to take some much needed steps to helping that part of the body heal. Whether it be walking, stretching, exercises or physical therapy, with the assistance of cayenne, you can help your body heal a lot sooner!
Beyond the Cayenne
This rub is full of additional ingredients that will help your tired, achy muscles relax and maybe even heal some!!
Coconut oil is a wonderful oil that nourishes the skin. It is antimicrobial so is a perfect base for this rub. Coconut oil has been shown to have its own pain reducing and anti-inflammatory properties. 3
Raw cocoa butter is nourishing to the skin. It contains a high amount of antioxidants (just like chocolate) and will be nicely absorbed by the skin along with the beneficial herbs to help penetrate the muscles below.
Ginger is an spic with a long history of use in both Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is naturally anti-inflammatory and warming. When used in a muscle rub it will help stimulate the movement of blood flow. This allows for new blood to come into the area bringing with it new immune cells and helps push along old blood containing inflammatory cells that have done their job at the site of pain. 4
Turmeric, similar to ginger, is a spice with a very long history of use for its anti-inflammatory and healing effects. Turmeric will help to reduce swelling and keep the body’s inflammation in check. Remember inflammation is good for the healing process. But not when the body is chronically inflamed. 5
Peppermint Essential Oil has menthol in it. This is another common compound used for muscle soreness as it will reduce pain and relax the muscles. Peppermint cools an area providing similar relief as ice. 6 There is a nice balance here with the ginger and the peppermint. The former is working to warm the area and bring new blood flow and immune cells, while the later is constricting the muscles and moving the blood along to get rid of waste.
It is a really wonderful combination!
In addition to using the rub for sore muscles, remember to:
Rest the area. One of the worst things most people do is to not sufficiently rest an area that chronically has pain. Rest is paramount to healing! With low back pain, lying down or sitting with legs up is often helpful.
Drink plenty of water. Water is needed to carry your blood around and in that blood there are immune cells just waiting to help reduce inflammation. Adequate water is paramount to healing. Be sure to drink  your body weight in ounces of water a day. If you are dealing with an injured area, another 15-20 ounces will go a long way.
Consider taking Turmeric capsules for arthritis pain reduction and healing. Turmeric capsules, 1500mg/day, has been shown to be just as effective as NSAIDs for reducing pain in folks with knee osteoarthritis, and without the side effects like NSAIDS (one of which is delayed healing). 5
Cayenne Muscle & Joint Rub Recipe:
 cup coconut oil
 cup raw cocoa butter (if you can’t find this, then just use all coconut oil)
 cup beeswax (grated to facilitate melting process)
2 tsp organic Cayenne powder
1 tsp organic Turmeric powder
1 tsp organic Ginger powder
10 drops of peppermint essential oil
Instructions:
Place the coconut oil, cocoa butter and beeswax into a pyrex glass container and place that into a sauce pan that contains 2-3 inches of water (the pyrex will be resting in the water).
Bring the water to a simmer. Continually stir the mixture until the cocoa butter and beeswax are completely melted, along with the coconut oil.
Add the cayenne, turmeric and ginger powder and stir until they are completely moistened (roughly a minute).
Remove from heat and add the peppermint essential oil.
Pour the mixture into a glass jar immediately and allow to cool before placing a lid on top.
Use liberally on affected area.
Storage: best stored in the fridge due to the fact it does not have preservatives in it. Lasts approximately 6-8 weeks.
CAUTION: be sure to wash your hands after you apply to affected area, as both cayenne and peppermint EO can be very strong. Also, turmeric may cause mild skin yellowing which is normal.

"Nurses are the too-often-unsung heroes of the medical community, and we rely on their wisdom to keep us healthy and safe. Did you know that their years of experience in handling everything from from IV-lines to bed pans have given them knowledge in tons of other areas, too? Little Things gathered up some of their most varied and helpful tips to share with us. Whether you’re dealing with a nasty stench, an ugly cut, anxiety or some crazy hair, there’s a nurse genius life hack to get you out of the bind. Read on for EIGHT of them!
* Smear toothpaste on your finger— and below your nose.
OK, so the toothpaste-on-the-finger tricks? It’s to help your breathing! The menthol in the toothpaste blocks odors and stenches that are not only unpleasant, but can make it hard to breathe. Smear some on your hands to sniff when you need, use it more directly by smearing it below your nose, or double-up on face masks and put a layer of ointment between them. Toothpaste, Vicks VapoRub, and/or anything mentholated will work well!
This one isn’t (just) about cleaning up after patients; it’s about calming down! We all get anxious and worried sometimes, and simple folding – think towels, washcloths, and other things hard to mess up – is calming because the action distracts us and makes us feel useful without requiring intense concentration.
You know those liquid bandages that are becoming more and more popular? Guess what they resemble— superglue! If you don’t have any bandages, superglue absolutely works as a way to seal and protect your cuts, scrapes and injuries. Just apply a small amount and go about your business. Obviously, for deep or intense cuts, you should see a medical professional, but we can all take care of minor ones ourselves.
Or a sanitary pad! Blood absorption is, after all, what they were designed to do. Stop a nosebleed by cutting a tampon in half and gently sticking it into your nose. Don’t go too deep! Use a sanitary pad to stop the bleeding from cuts, the same way you’d use any other cloth or gauze.
Whether the stain has set in already or the spill has just happened, hydrogen peroxide is your new best friend. Pour some on a cloth and dab to both prevent a stain from setting and to remove ones that have already settled.
One of the most common diet directives you get in a hospital is to cut out salt, but that can leave your food tasting bland, especially if you’re used to a high-sodium diet. Add some flavor without endangering your health by sprinkling lemon juice on your meals.
Let’s say your hands are covered in a particularly sticky substance you can’t get off no matter how hard you try. Use shaving cream like a lotion to help break it up, break it down, and take it off, then finish off with wipes or your regular cleaning routine.
If your hair is severely tangled or matted, you can use rubbing alcohol to detangle it. It works by breaking down whatever substance caused the tangles and undoing the knots. Simply put a few drops on the area and gently massage it through your hair.
So smart! It’s incredible how many different hats nurses wear. Aren’t you grateful we can benefit from their wisdom? Check out the original article on Little Thingsfor even more, then tell us which of these life hacks you’re going to try first! Do we have any nurse-readers out there who want to add to this list?",1
"A friend of Gulliver’s recently received some devastating news, in the form of a change to company policy. No longer would he and his co-workers be able to book their own flights and file for reimbursements. Instead, the firm would buy all employees’ plane tickets from the start.
On the face of it, this is a convenient change. It saves staff time by ensuring that they do not have to fill in tedious expense forms. But many business travellers may not see it that way. A study from Phocuswright, a travel-research firm, finds that more and more employees are booking their own travel and filing for reimbursements. Sometimes doing so allows for a better itinerary: travellers can avoid annoying layovers and airlines for which they reserve particular ire. Sometimes, if they are feeling generous towards their employer, it can save money too.
But the most compelling reason is often the credit-card reward points. Say you are booking a flight from London to New York. On United Airlines, the round-trip will earn you close to 2,000 miles (3,218 km). Not bad. But if you book the flight at a popular time it may cost $1,000. With the most-generous credit cards, that could be worth an additional 3,000 points, which can be turned into air miles, cash or other rewards. Then add in the cost of a hotel for a few nights, transport to and from the airport and around town and a few dinners. In total, you could be on the way to the 12,500 points needed for an average American domestic flight. This windfall is all from a short business trip—but only if you book it with your own credit card.
Workers who book their own trips—dramatically dubbed “rogue travellers” by the New York Times—are still in the minority. Most use a corporate travel agent or a company booking tool. But an increasing number are going rogue.
This is possible because companies’ policies around booking business trips tend to be quite flexible. According to the Phocuswright study, 8-10% of companies have “tightly managed” policies, meaning employees must use certain suppliers and will not be reimbursed if they use others. That suggests around 90% of firms allow workers to choose which airline to fly, which hotel to stay in, and whether to travel by taxi or Uber. And even in tightly managed companies, more than half of employees say they can use any airline, and nearly half can use any hotel or car-rental firm. That makes sense from the employer’s perspective. Why limit options when cheaper and more convenient alternatives may be out there?
The trend towards rogue bookings is aided by technology in two ways. First, travellers are increasingly using mobile devices to book their business trips. In companies with travel policies, over a third of employees book their travel on mobile devices; for hotels, that share is more than half. That allows travellers to book lodging and other logistics on the go, rather than dealing with travel managers or agents hundreds of miles away. Millennials are, unsurprisingly, leading the charge toward mobile bookings. (Notably, the West is far behind China in this respect, where 53% of all online travel bookings last year were made on mobile devices, compared with 25% in Britain and 21% in America.)
But technology is also allowing employers to track their staff. Some companies do this with software like TripLink, a booking-centralisation tool from Concur, a travel-expense firm. It lets employers monitor all employees’ bookings to ensure they are in line with company policy. Other firms use apps to track workers’travel. This is particularly useful when trips take workers to unstable parts of the world.
In other words, rogue travellers are not really going rogue when their independent bookings are under ever-greater scrutiny and control. But then again, maybe independence is not really the goal here. Sometimes, it’s all about the air miles.",0

The talented new chef at this restaurant with rooms offers exquisite meals with molecular and new Nordic elements, but the basics are spot on, too
roviding butter at a spreadable temperature is a skill all hoteliers should have mastered. The rarity with which this simple task is accomplished, however, means that when you do come across a warm, yielding pat of butter, you sit up and pay attention. Clearly, someone is sweating the small stuff. That would be Kath and Liam Berney, owners of Cottage in the Wood (CITW), a whitewashed 16th-century restaurant with rooms in England’s only mountain forest, Whinlatter, west of Keswick.
“Do you prefer your scrambled eggs creamy or set?” asks Kath, before serving a terrific breakfast with woodland mushrooms and bacon on sourdough. This attentiveness continues throughout (fresh milk and homemade biscuits in bedrooms; warnings about midges if windows are left open at night; games, books and walking guides in the lounge), yet it never feels oppressive. In contrast to more forbidding Lake District gastro destinations, Liam and Kath offer a warm, breezy experience. “We see ourselves as a foodie bolthole,” says Liam, “but we want to be accessible.”
Accessibility is relative, but CITW’s cottage rooms (a little boxy, shower power domestic, not that well noise insulated but offering sound comfort), start at 110 B&B. There are four more glamorous rooms, too: the garden room looks a doozy.
But the real stars of the show here are nature and Rich Collingwood, the new-ish head chef at the now 15-year-old CITW. The conservatory dining room feels as though it is embedded in the mountains, ferns and streams (cleverly rendered in miniature in the table decorations), and red squirrels occasionally scamper across the terrace. Collingwood’s exquisite plates of light, clean food and intense flavours are as refreshing as the country air.
There’s some technical, molecular stuff, such as cherries and raspberries filled with hyper-real fruit gels, and a L’Enclume-like use of curious ingredients: dill emulsion, wood sorrel granita, a brilliant strawberry gazpacho. There’s a little New Nordic fermentation and foraging, too. Crucially, this creativity is underpinned by a precise understanding of how components interact on the plate.
Such cooking is often ruined by clumsiness, but here there is no over-elaboration. The elements of each dish are proportionate, to the millimetre (do not expect a trencherman’s feed!). Collingwood’s scallop ceviche, with salty, funky fermented turnip, apple and dots of roe cream, has real clarity of flavour – as has his ornate plate of smoked eel, intense eel jelly, caviar and segments of Jersey Royal. The centrepiece of the tasting menu is that iconic Lakeland product, Herdwick hogget (crispy breast, loin, sweetbreads), with burnt aubergine purée (like super-boosted baba ganoush), sheep’s yoghurt, mint oil and pickled artichoke. It is like the hogget has been on holiday to North Africa and found its old va-va-voom.
These many dish elements are described tableside by the staff, but it is not a test. No one will quiz you. Likewise, Liam can give you chapter and verse on his small-producer and organic wines, or leave you to get sloshed. Your call. And you don’t have to buy into the pseudoscience of biodynamic viticulture to concede that some of Liam’s choices in that field taste fantastic.
CITW sits on Magic Hill (so named because a downhill slope appears to go uphill due to the surrounding land). It’s a fitting address. This is a cocoon of miraculous comfort and pleasure.

In terms of mountains, Latrigg is a quick, easy walk from town. Walla Crag is slightly longer, and if we’re feeling very energetic, we go all the way over Falcon Crag and down into Borrowdale to Shepherd’s Café at High Lodore Farm, and catch the open-top bus back.

Aluminum has been long known to be neurotoxic, with mounting evidence that chronic exposure is a factor in many neurological diseases, including dementia, autism, and Parkinson’s disease.
However, definitive scientific proof is difficult to establish due to the the lack of longitudinal studies, as well as pushback from industries that use aluminum in their products. Despite the shortage of conclusive studies, mounting scientific evidence leaves little room for doubt.
Case in point: a new case study from Keele University in the UK unequivocally shows high levels of aluminum in the brain of an individual exposed to aluminum at work, who later died from Alzheimer’s disease.
While aluminum exposure has been implicated in Alzheimer’s and a number of other neurological diseases, this case claims to be “the first direct link” between Alzheimer’s disease and elevated brain aluminum following occupational exposure.
The Aluminum-Alzheimer’s Link
The 66 year-old Caucasian man developed an aggressive form of early onset Alzheimer’s disease after eight years of occupational exposure to aluminum dust, which scientists conclude “suggests a prominent role for the olfactory system and lungs in the accumulation of aluminum in the brain.”
This is not the first time high aluminum levels have been found in the tissues of someone who died from Alzheimer’s disease. For example, in 2004, high aluminum levels were found in the tissues of a British woman who died of early-onset Alzheimer’s.
This was 16 years after an industrial accident dumped 20 metric tons of aluminum sulphate into her local drinking water. And there are many studies showing elevated aluminum levels in living individuals displaying a wide range of neurological symptoms.
Aluminum Can Be an Occupational Hazard
Exposure to aluminum is unfortunately an occupational hazard for those who work in industries like mining, factory work, welding, and agriculture. Not to mention that you ingest aluminum vapors every time your nose catches cigarette smoke wafting by.
Inhaling aluminum dust or vapors sends aluminum particles directly into your lungs in a highly absorbable form, where they pass into your bloodstream and are distributed throughout your body, including your bones and brain. Aluminum powder has been known to cause pulmonary fibrosis, and aluminum factory workers are prone to asthma. Studies of the health effects of aluminum vapors have been grim, pointing to high levels of neurotoxicity.
So why are most government regulators and physicians so resistant to looking at the health and environmental effects of aluminum? One filmmaker is shining a light on this issue by way of a documentary.

The ‘Dark Side’ of Aluminum Exposed
The featured documentary, The Age of Aluminum, reveals the “dark side” of this toxic metal, exploring the scientific links between aluminum and diseases such as breast cancer and neurological disorders. Also exposed is how aluminum mining and manufacturing have created acute ecological problems across the globe, leading to environmental disasters in Hungary, South Africa, and the UK. In the film, neuroscientist Christopher Shaw reports:
“Many researchers are beginning to accept that aluminum has some sort of role to play in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Whether it does in others is still an open question, but Alzheimer’s is really coming into focus and it’s fairly clear that the body burden of aluminum from all the sources to which humans are exposed may be contributing to Alzheimer’s disease.”
Aluminum Is Everywhere
Although aluminum occurs naturally in soil, water, and air, we are contributing to the load with the mining and processing of aluminum ores, manufacturing of aluminum products, and the operation of coal-fired power plants and incinerators. Aluminum can’t be destroyed in the environment—it only changes its form by attaching or separating from other particles.
Rain washes aluminum particles out of the air and into our water supply, where they tend to accumulate rather than degrade. If you live in an industrial area, your exposure is undoubtedly higher than average.
According to CDC, the average adult in the US consumes about seven to nine mg of aluminum per day in food, and a lesser amount from air and water. Only about one percent of the aluminum you ingest orally gets absorbed into your body—the rest is moved out by your digestive tract, provided it’s functioning well.
When tested in a lab, aluminum contamination has been found in a vast number of products on the market, from foods and beverages to pharmaceuticals, which suggests the manufacturing process itself is a significant part of the problem. Aluminum is found in a shocking number of foods and consumer products, including:
-Foods such as baking powder, self rising flour, salt, baby formula, coffee creamers, baked goods and processed foods, coloring and caking agents
-Drugs, such as antacids, analgesics, anti-diarrheals, and others; additives such as magnesium stearate
-Vaccines—Hepatitis A and B, Hib, DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), pneumococcal vaccine, Gardasil (HPV), and others
-Cosmetics and personal care products such as antiperspirants, deodorants (including salt crystals, made of alum), lotions, sunscreens, and shampoos
-Aluminum products, including foil, cans, juice pouches, tins, and water bottles
Does Your Frozen Dinner Come with a Side of Aluminum?
Aluminum contamination in our food supply is a more significant problem than you may think. In a study published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe, researchers analyzed 1,431 non-animal foods and beverages for aluminum content. This is what they found:
-77.8 percent had an aluminum concentration of up to 10 mg/kg
-17.5 percent had aluminum concentrations between 10 and 100 mg\kg
-4.6 percent of the samples had aluminum concentrations in excess of 100 mg/kg
Aluminum compounds are often used as additives in foodstuffs. Additional contamination occurs when food comes into contact with aluminum equipment and other items because aluminum is unstable in the presence of acids and bases. Aluminum equipment has a protective oxide film, but this can be damaged as fine fissures develop from normal wear and tear. In the study, Table 3 shows the aluminum content of everything from flour and baking mixes to soup, chocolate, beer and wine, and herbal teas. Some products show a wide range of contamination levels, and others are more homogenous. Baked goods are very high because of the common practice of baking and storing foods on aluminum trays. The report has numerous other tables that demonstrate how prevalent this toxin is in your food.
If you cook your food in aluminum foil, you are introducing your own contamination. One investigation found that cooking meats in aluminum foil increases their aluminum concentration. Researchers concluded, “eating meals prepared in aluminum foil may carry a health risk by adding to other aluminum sources.” As with many toxins, it isn’t one exposure here and there that is so concerning—it’s the cumulative effect of many smaller exposures over time that can lead to a toxic metal overload and erosion of your health. According to a 2006 study, cooking meat in aluminum foil increased aluminum levels as follows:
-Red meats cooked in aluminum foil showed an increase in aluminum by 89 to 378 percent
-Poultry increased by 76 to 214 percent
-Aluminum levels increased with higher cooking temperatures and longer cooking times
Aluminum Heads Straight to Your Brain
Aluminum is to your central nervous system as cigarette smoke is to your lungs. Scientists are clear that toxic metals damage brain tissue and lead to degenerative disease by producing oxidative stress—and aluminum is one of the worst offenders. With Alzheimer’s rates skyrocketing, today’s multiple avenues of aluminum exposure are of great concern. Just as with particles in the environment, once aluminum is in your tissues, your body has a difficult time releasing it. This toxic metal serves absolutely no biological purpose, so the less of it you ingest, the better.
Once in your body, it travels around easily, unimpeded, piggybacking on your iron transport system. It crosses biological barriers that normally keep other types of toxins out, such as your blood-brain barrier. Over time, aluminum can accumulate in your brain and do serious damage your neurological health—regardless of your age. Aluminum toxicity may be doing as much damage to our children as to our seniors.
Brain Inflammation in Both Children and Adults
Vaccines present a particularly problematic source of toxic metal exposure. Aluminum is the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant and is considered “safe” even though research shows it may induce serious immunological disorders and neurological complications in humans.
In the video above, Dr. David Ayoub discusses how the aluminum in vaccines may be even more dangerous than mercury. The number of aluminum-containing vaccines children receive today has quadrupled over the past 30 years. In the 1970s, children got only four aluminum-containing vaccines in their first 18 months of life, but now they typically receive 17. And as children’s aluminum burden has increased, so has the prevalence of childhood neurological disorders. In one school, 90 percent of the children developed ADHD during the course of a single school year, and their toxicity profiles all revealed massive amounts of aluminum.
Aluminum is also in vaccines and is used as an adjuvant. If you go by the aluminum content on vaccine labels, the amount kids are getting is excessive, but if you add in the aluminum NOT listed on the labels—”accidental exposure” due to contamination—it’s a much more serious problem. Dr. Ayoub cites one study that found five to six times more aluminum in vaccines than what was actually listed on the labels.
When you review the signs and symptoms of aluminum toxicity, they are shockingly similar to the symptoms of autism, ADHD, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other neurological diseases. Vaccine adjuvants can cause serious chronic brain inflammation. Aluminum targets your cerebellum and autonomic nervous system—the part responsible for biological processes over which you have no conscious control (breathing, blood pressure, balance, coordination, etc.). When you look at the MSDS sheet for aluminum, you will see symptoms strikingly similar to those in common neurological diseases, including memory problems, speech impairments and aphasia, dementia, depression, muscle weakness, motor disturbances, and other neurological difficulties. The list goes on and on.

Researchers Claim New Blood Test May Predict Alzheimer’s
There has never been a way to accurately predict who will get Alzheimer’s, but that may be changing. Researchers at Georgetown University and University of Rochester claim they have found a blood test that predicts this with 90 percent accuracy—and incredibly, with NO false negatives. If further research confirms what researchers expect, this is a medical breakthrough of epic proportions.
The test involves measuring the patterns of 10 specific lipids (fat-like compounds) associated with the plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. These 10 lipids are highly predictive of whether or not you will become cognitively impaired. All of the people in the study were in their 70s, so the next step is to determine if the test is accurate earlier, say in your 40s and 50s. Researchers say they are still several years away from implementing the test, but they all feel very hopeful.
Biomarkers such as lipids are tricky for Alzheimer’s because they change during the course of the illness. Some occur in high levels during the early phase of the disease and then actually decrease after symptoms appear—so they are stage dependent. There is clearly much more research that needs to be done before we have a grasp of this disease. Even with a test that can predict whether or not you are in the process of developing dementia, there are no good treatments once you have it—so you should be doing everything in your power to prevent it. One of the strategies is helping your body detoxify from metals, such as aluminum.
Aluminum Impairs Your Body’s Ability to Detoxify
Removing mercury from vaccines and replacing it with aluminum may be increasing the problems from BOTH toxins in your body. The reason for this is because aluminum impairs your body’s ability to excrete mercury by impeding your glutathione production. Glutathione is your most important intracellular detoxifier, required for reversing oxidative stress. So, if your aluminum load is high, your body will potentially become more toxic from the mercury from, say, flu shots and fish because you are now on “aluminum overload” and your detoxification system no longer functions well.
Your body requires sulfur to manufacture glutathione, making sulfur an extremely important dietary nutrient when it comes to metal detoxification, which can be optimized through dietary sources. Onions and garlic are good if they are grown in sulfur rich soils, but most soils are unfortunately sulfur deficient. Therefore, animal-based proteins seem to be one of your best bets. Whey protein concentrate is particularly high in cysteine, one of the two sulfur-bearing amino acids that are direct precursors to glutathione.
Please note that if you avoid consuming animal proteins, it is VERY easy to become sulfur deficient, and this may be one of the most significant risk factors for choosing an animal protein-free diet. That doesn’t mean you should go overboard on meat, however! Most people need only about one gram of protein per kilogram of lean body weight, or about half a gram of protein per pound of lean body mass. Also make sure to buy grass-fed and finished meats, as most factory farmed meat is of inferior quality and contaminated with a whole host of veterinary drugs, including antibiotics and growth hormones.
How to Detoxify Aluminum
There are a number of potent chelators you can use to detoxify aluminum. Clearly, your first step would be to avoid further exposure to aluminum. This means avoiding products such as:
–Toothpaste containing aluminium oxyhydroxide
-Antiperspirants containing aluminum chloride, aluminum chlorohydrate, or aluminum-zirconium compounds
-Aluminum laminated pouch drinks
-Aluminum cookware
-Aluminum espresso makers
For serious Alzheimer’s disease, the following chelating agents can be helpful:
-Silica-rich water, such as Fiji water, which contains 83 Mg of silica per liter. Researchpublished in 2013 showed that drinking up to one liter of a silicon-rich mineral water daily for 12 weeks effectively excreted aluminum via the urine, without detrimental effects on essential metals such as iron and copper. According to the authors: “We have provided preliminary evidence that over 12 weeks of silicon-rich mineral water therapy the body burden of aluminum fell in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and, concomitantly, cognitive performance showed clinically relevant improvements in at least 3 out of 15 individuals.”
-Melatonin: Research [source, source, source] shows that melatonin has a metal binding role and is a useful supplement in the treatment of neurological disorders in which oxidative stress is involved, which includes Alzheimer’s. Melatonin can travel freely across all cellular barriers, facilitating the removal of toxic metals such as aluminum. It also appears to suppress the oxidative activity of aluminum in your brain.

-Anything that raises your glutathione. Your body synthesizes glutathione from three amino acids: cysteine, glutamate, and glycine. Raw fruits and vegetables, particularly avocado, asparagus, grapefruit, strawberries, orange, tomato, cantaloupe, broccoli, okra, peach, zucchini, and spinach are rich in the precursors glutamate and glycine. Dietary sources of cysteine include eggs, meat, red peppers, garlic, onions, Brussels sprouts, whey protein, and wheat germ. Other helpful treatments for improved glutathione metabolism include:
-Exercise: Exercise affects your adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels needed to help produce glutathione
-Optimizing your vitamin D levels through sun exposure: There’s some evidence vitamin D increases intracellular glutathione levels
-Epsom salt baths
-MSM supplementation
-The supplement N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC) may also be useful. NAC is the rate-limiting nutrient for the formation of the intracellular antioxidant glutathione
–Curcumin: Research suggests that curcumin has a protective effect against aluminum-induced damage by modulating the extent of oxidative stress. It also decreases beta-amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer’s, delays neuron degradation, chelates metals, decreases microglia formation, and has an overall anti-inflammatory, antioxidant effect. Studies have shown that curcumin can help improve memory in Alzheimer’s patients. There are some contraindications that curcumin is not recommended if you have biliary tract obstruction (as it stimulates bile secretion), gallstones, obstructive jaundice, or acute biliary colic.
In Summary
It can no longer be argued that aluminum does not have a role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s—the evidence is very clear and growing. It really should not be surprising that people with aluminum toxicity display many of the same symptoms as those with dementia, Parkinson’s, ADHD, autism, and other neurological diseases, because aluminum targets exactly these areas of your brain and nervous system.
The best way to protect yourself is to be careful about your choices in food and personal products, and minimize your use of vaccines and other drugs that are often contaminated with aluminum.
Optimizing your dietary sulfur is also essential, as your body needs sulfur to manufacture its number one weapon against aluminum overload: glutathione. By taking a few steps to protect yourself, you’ll minimize your exposure while maximizing your body’s ability to rid itself of this toxic metal, which will move you toward a long and healthy life well into your senior years.

What are orange peel for and which are their benefits?
Every time we consume oranges to make juices, milkshakes, sauces for meats or simply eat it as a fruit, we discard the husk because we find exactly no use for it. But this is a big mistake because the orange peel has many properties and may have many uses that you probably did not know.
Let’s find out how useful you can give to the orange peels once you have consumed the fruit and do not worry about the bitter taste because in the end we will teach you how to prepare them so that they lose the bitterness and you can enjoy them to the maximum.
Reduces cholesterol: Orange in itself has numerous antioxidants that are extremely useful to fight free radicals, responsible for generating dangerous diseases; But precisely in the shells are the best benefits to reduce LDL cholesterol which is the one that accumulates plaques inside our arteries and damages the heart.
Eliminates acidity: If you have heartburn or heartburn problems, nothing better than orange peel to feel good again. Consume this natural remedy for 20 days and you will notice significant relief from your heartburn.
Prevents cancer: As previously said, orange repels free radicals and orange peel also contains other chemicals that inhibit the growth of cancer cells.
Respiratory Problems: Orange peel also has vitamins C, which stimulates the immune system and helps prevent respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, colds, asthma and influenza.
Stimulates digestion: The dietary fiber found in orange peel helps patients suffering from irritable bowel, constipation and abdominal inflammation. An infusion of orange peel promotes digestion and relieves pain.
Room Aromatizer: The aroma of the orange peel is intoxicating. This citric like all the others can perfectly serve like aromatizador of environments treading in each room a fresh and relaxing perfume that everyone likes. You can heat orange peels in a bowl and mix them at the same time with cinnamon, sandalwood, bay leaves and mint.
Whitening your teeth: If you need to whiten your teeth and analyze the possibility of expensive and tedious bleaching first try the orange peel. Use the white interior of the orange peel to rub your teeth, which in addition to whitening them will help prevent tooth sensitivity.
Fertilizer for plants: The orange peel is ideal as fertilizer because it has a lot of nitrogen that helps plants and flowers grow stronger and faster. All the nutrients in the orange peel are beneficial to your garden.
Bleaching the skin: Vitamin C from orange peels is a natural skin bleach. Boil several orange peels, let cool and strain. Apply this infusion on the skin to cover imperfections and remove dark spots. This extract that orange peel also helps to tone the skin, close the pores and protect from harmful rays of the sun.
In the kitchen: Also the orange peel can serve as decoration of dishes or to give a semi bitter taste and at the same time citric to food.
Insect Repellent: The same infusion we previously prepared to cover the spots on the skin can serve to ward off insects. Place this liquid in a spray bottle and spray on window frames and doors and even floors to prevent pests from entering your home. Also the aroma of the burnt orange peel away insects.
Next, we’ll teach you how to prepare candied orange peels so you can make the most of this wonderful fruit.
Ingredients:
–  kilo of orange peel.
–  kilo of sugar.
–  liter of water.
Preparation:
– Firstly, it is important that you choose organic oranges because usually oranges are covered with pesticides that protect them from insects, but this pesticides are very dangerous to health so it is essential at the time of making this recipe use organic oranges and Free of toxics.
– Peel the oranges and remove some of the white skin from the inside but not completely.
– Cut the oranges into thin strips (in Juliana) and put them in hot water. When it breaks the boil, strain, drain and repeat the same operation 5 times more; That is, put back into water, when the boil breaks, and so on. This basically serves to bring out the bitter taste.
– Once we have repeated the procedure that will have removed the bitter taste, place the half liter of water with the orange peels and half a kilo of sugar and boil for five minutes with the pot uncovered.
– Remove from the heat and let stand until the next day in the same container.
– The next day cook again until the oranges start to brown and are shiny. Once the syrup is thick, remove.
– You can distribute them in a grate and let dry in the oven very smooth, with the oven door open for 10 minutes.
– They are ready to be consumed!

"Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, called Wednesday for the expanded use of medication-assisted treatmentsfor opioid addiction, saying they could reduce overdoses and deaths.
During a House hearing on the federal response to the opioid epidemic, Gottlieb said the agency will issue new guidance to manufacturers to promote the development of novel therapies, including ones that treat a wider range of symptoms. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) combines drugs and counseling to combat addiction.
There are three FDA-approved MATs to help people reduce or quit their use of heroin and other opiates such as prescription painkillers: methadone; buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone, and naltrexone, also known as Vivitrol. All work in different ways.Patients receiving these treatments cut their risk of death in half, Gottlieb said in a statement last month.
Patients should be offered all three options so they and their doctors can decide which is best — but often that doesn't happen because of inadequate insurance coverage, Gottlieb said Wednesday. He said some people might need such medication for years, if not for their entire lives, and the agency is revising drug labels to reflect that.
A report by the Pew Charitable Trusts concluded last year that MAT is the most effective way to deal with opioid use disorder, far superior to behavioral interventions or medication alone. Compared to non-drug approaches, MAT reduces illicit opioid use and decreases fatal overdoses, the report said. But the treatment often is unavailable because of a lack of programs to help people with opioid problems.
Gottlieb, who became commissionerin May, has said repeatedly that combating the opioid epidemic is his top priority. In his statement last month, he said the agency would step up efforts to ensuretreatment for people with addiction problems and mental health conditions.
FDA critics have accused it of helping fuel the epidemic by approving too many opioids in past years and not placing more restrictions on their use. Under Gottlieb, the agency has taken several actions aimed at curbing the crisis. It has stepped up its targeting of fentanyl and other synthetic opioid imports at postal facilities and imposed tougher doctor-training rules on opioid manufacturers. The opioid painkiller Opana ER was pulled off the market earlier this year at the FDA's request.
On Wednesday, Gottlieb also said theagency is planning a meeting on the benefits of expanded addiction treatment at the broader “population level.” He cited a Massachusetts study that showed a greater than 50 percent decrease in the risk of overdose deaths among individuals treated with methadone or buprenorphine following an overdose.
He said the FDA is conducting research that would lead to a label indication calling for such treatment for everyone who has an overdose, based on data showing a reduction in death at a community level. Such a step would be a first for the agency.

A professor at Northern Arizona University docked a student's grade over use of non-gender-neutral language. (Image source: Northern Arizona University)
An Arizona college professor docked a student’s grade on a paper for using the term “mankind” as another word for “humanity.”
Cailin Jeffers, an English major atNorthern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona,told Campus Reform that she received an email from professorAnne Scott explaining the decision to take away one point on a paper over student’s use of the politically incorrect term.
According to NAU’s website, Scott teaches undergraduate courses related to various types of literature, including American minority literature.
Jeffers said that Scott sent an email to the class after grading students’ first essay. The email instructed students to always number their pages, use proper Modern Language Association format and other reasonable requests. However, Jeffers said she was struck by one particular rule.
The professor told students to use only “gender-neutral” language. As one example, Jeffers said “humankind” should be used instead of “mankind.”
“I thought this was absurd, and I wasn’t sure if she was serious,” Jeffers told Campus Reform.
So Jeffers decided to test it out, and in her next essay, Jeffers used the term “mankind” instead of “humankind.”
Scott later sent Jeffers an email with her grade for the second essay. Jeffers scored 39 out 50 but would have received a 40 out of 50 had she been politically correct in her language.A “specific breakdown” of points for the essay showed Jeffers deducted one point for “problems with diction (word choice).” Scott explained her reasoning for the decision in an email to Jeffers.
I would be negligent, as a professor who is running a class about the human condition and the assumptions we make about being “human,” if I did not also raise this issue of gendered language and ask my students to respect the need for gender-neutral language. The words we use matter very much, or else teachers would not be making an issue of this at all, and the MLA would not be making recommendations for gender-neutral language at the national level.
I will respect your choice to leave your diction choices “as is” and to make whatever political and linguistic statement you want to make by doing so. By the same token, I will still need to subtract a point because your choice will not be made in the letter or spirit of this particular class, which is all about having you and other students looking beneath your assumptions and understanding that “mankind” does not mean “all people” to all people. It positively does not.
Scott gave Jeffers the option of revising the paper to earn additional points. The professor further informed the student that she could appeal her grade to the department chair.It’s not clear, however, if Jeffers chose to do either.
Scott later sent an email to the entire class recalling“an important discussion that I had with one of our class members today about gender-neutral language.” The email to the entire class explained that “word choices have consequences” and that it “goes beyond ‘political correctness.'”
The email, quoted below, did not mention Jeffers by name.
In a class such as this, wherein the course goals, discussions, readings, and assignments are all focused on what makes us “human” and the assumptions we make about such a concept, it is crucial that we also understand what our word choices mean a great deal and have consequences in terms of what we reveal about our assumptions about ourselves and others, and the world generally.
The issue goes beyond “political correctness,” for my colleagues and I recognize that words help to create our reality, power dynamics, and relationships among people. You are welcome to make a statement about your politics, or conscience, or beliefs by using gender-specific language in your papers, and in many cases gender-specific language is called for, when you can discern with certainty the gender of the characters and author you’re discussing. However, I’ll still have to subtract a point or two for any kind of language that refers to all people as “mankind” or readers as “him/he”, for the reasons I’ve outlined carefully above.
Scott did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TheBlaze.A representative for Northern Arizona University did not return a call.

"At first, it was “Oh robots, cool! I want to help kids build that,” said Zhiquan (who goes by ZQ) Yeo, Bloomberg Engineer and mentor for FIRST Robotics Team 354 from George Westinghouse High School. But it soon evolved into “Wow, these kids have so much potential, I really want to help them grow and shape their future.”
Bloomberg has increasingly been involved with the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) since 2004. Engineers at Bloomberg, like ZQ, were especially interested in contributing their technical skills to local communities in a meaningful way. Many soon realize that the most rewarding experience is witnessing the students’ character development and growing excitement for solving problems with technology.
Through Bloomberg Philanthropies, a strong supporter of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) education and providing students access to pursue STEAM careers – Bloomberg sponsored 18 FIRST Robotics teams this year for more than 500 high school students from high-need communities in New York City, Trenton (New Jersey), San Francisco and London.
Over 60 Bloomberg employees from engineering and other departments volunteer their time and talents to mentor these teams. They provide guidance on real-world engineering and teamwork skills throughout the six week competition as the student teams each build an industrial-size robot for field battles against other robots.
Bloomberg mentors teach basic programming techniques, often to high school students with no prior programming experience, to come up with algorithms and run the robot in autonomous mode. In addition, these volunteer mentors are working with students in designing and constructing their robot, serving as a sounding board for students to discuss their ideas and feasibility.
ZQ recalls, “The coolest thing is not the robot, but actually watching all the kids team up to build the robot and come up with their own ideas.” Bloomberg employees become not just a mentor in robotics but also an advocate, offering the students encouragement and advice in life and career paths.
Bloomberg Engineer and mentor for Team 2895 from Queens Information Research and Technology High School, Joseph Pokorny mentions, “The students’ contributions and creative problem solving skills mature rapidly as their dependency on you dwindles. And you can really see this new self-confidence emerge from the quiet and shy person they once were.”
Furthermore, it is truly a partnership between Bloomberg, our employee volunteers and the school. Joel Bianchi, Coach of Team 1660 Harlem Knights from Frederick Douglass Academy comments, “It’s really transformed our team since Bloomberg has come on as a mentor; it took our team to the next level.”
Our involvement in FRC not only supports the teams we sponsor and mentor, but also making opportunities available to students. Over the past 3 years, we’ve had 6 FIRST Robotics student competitors as high school summer interns at Bloomberg. Four are returning to intern with us this summer. Another former intern and FIRST competitor, Stephon Lawrence, is now working part-time at Bloomberg in Engineering while attending Brooklyn College. Additionally, he mentors Bloomberg sponsored FRC Team 369 from William Grady and Rachel Carson High Schools.
This season, five of our sponsored FRC teams so far have won qualifying regional competitions advancing to the 2017 FRC World Championship in St. Louis, MO held in late April. Our largest group ever! This coming weekend, ten Bloomberg sponsored FRC teams will be competing at the NYC FIRST Regionals on April 9 to win an invitation to the World Championship.
For more details about our past FRC involvement, check out our 2015 FIRST Robotics season summary, here.
FIRST Robotics is a part of Bloomberg Startup, our global education engagement and mentoring program, leveraging Bloomberg’s history as a startup and unique expertise as a technology and data company to support academic achievement and career skills for high school and college students. This signature program combines mentoring programs with a workshop curriculum to create a one of a kind experience and provide access to opportunity and technical skills for our network of students and nonprofit partners.",0

What began as a bespoke store selling snowboarding equipment is now a platform powering half a million active stores and $40bn in sales to date. Shopify offers an easy to set up an online store with secure unlimited hosting. There is a well stocked theme store, plus a guide on building custom themes for clients who want a bespoke design.
Shopify also allows you to sell through several other channels: Facebook, Messenger, Pinterest, Amazon, and embedded Buy Buttons. Not all features are available in all countries, for example Pinterest Buyable Pins are not available outside the US.Plans start at $29 per month plus credit card fees, and transaction fees for payment gateways other than Shopify’s own.
Magento Open Source, formerly known as Community Edition, is a free open source (obviously) platform built in PHP. It comes with a basic, configurable store to get you started. In theory, because it is open source, it is more flexible and customizable than other, hosted, platforms. This may mean getting your hands dirty with PHP, although there is a large community of developers providing all sorts of free and paid add-ons and themes.
Although the software is free, you need to provide your own hosting, and unlike hosted solutions, the security side of things is not taken care of. There are certain legal and PCI (payment card industry) requirements that must be met. To address this PayPal is the payment solution recommended by Magento.
OpenCart is another feature rich open source platform. It is module based which means extensions can be added easily. Like Magento, it is free but there is again the same responsibilty to provide secure hosting. OpenCart offers a longer list of payment gateways, and the option to add more through extensions.
This is a solution for those who like to tinker, and get stuck in to some development, and not one to let a client loose on.
WooCommerce is an official WordPress plugin that will add a store to your WordPress site—there was a time when WordPress was for blogging, now it will even make the tea and pass you a biscuit. WooCommerce is built to work with themes, including the yearly default WordPress theme. There is also a free official theme, Storefront, which comes in 14 different flavors.
Several payment gateways are available, such as PayPal and Stripe and direct payment is an option, although it is up to the site owner to provide the SSL and other PCI compliance criteria here.
WooCommerce is completely free to install and use. Rather confusingly, clicking on the ‘Get Started’ button on the WooCommerce home page takes you to the sign up for a WordPress.com account. This gives the impression that the commerce plugin is only available on wordpress.com. That is not the case, it can be installed via your WordPress admin just like any other plugin.
EKM have been around since 2002, and although they are smaller than Shopify with 30,000 online shops, their sales to date of 5bn work out at a higher average sales rate per shop. They are squarely aimed at customers in the UK, although the actual stores sell internationally, with a couple of continental European offshoots.
Besides the usual list of features, themes, and payment options, EKM stress their customer support. You get a dedicated account manager free for the first three to six months, depending on the plan you choose.EKM is one of the pricier platforms, starting at 29.99 (+ VAT if applicable), but you are not paying separately for hosting, and the security is taken care of for you.
Volusion is one of the less expensive hosted eCommerce platforms with a site builder to get up and running with. Prices start at $13.50 a month but that only allows you 100 products and bandwidth limited to 1GB. You also have to buy your own SSL if you want touse direct payments. If you use more than your allocated bandwidth you get charged, but this is instead of a per transaction charge.
Volusion also offer custom design services as well as theme help, and marketing services.
Another hosted platform, BigCommerce starts at $29.95 per month. That includes unlimited products, file storage, bandwidth and staff accounts, hosting, SSL certificate and online sales of up to $50k per year. There are no additional transaction fees for using any of the major payment gateways, and POS transactions can be integrated with the online store.
BigCommerce also offers embeddable Buy Buttons, and integration with Facebook Shop, Amazon, eBay, and Google Shopping.
SupaDupa is one of the newer kids on the block, and one of the cheapest of the hosted platforms. Plans start at 6 (approx. $8) per month with unlimited bandwidth and no transaction fees. Credit card gateway, unlimited products and storage, and SSL certificate are only available on the higher priced plans but at 19 per month (approx $25), that’s still pretty reasonable.
SupaDupa say they are not claiming to have a platform for everybody, it is aimed at design related or creative businesses. Design customization is limited on the lower plans but there are over 40 themes to choose from and a custom design service is available.
PrestaShop is a free, open source platform. As with the other open source platforms mentioned, hosting is not provided and security—SSL certificates, PCI compliance etc—are your responsibility. There are a stack of payment methods available, and while not all of these modules are free, those for the big payment gateways such as PayPal and Stripe, are.
There is a well stocked theme store and a fairly active developer community. Training courses are available, and there are regular conferences and meetups.
LemonStand starts at $19 per month with no transaction fees. This includes unlimited products, storage and bandwidth, but only 75 orders per month. They claim unmatched flexibility with design customization, including the use of your choice of frontend framework.
This platform seems to be aimed less at merchants directly and more at designers and developers who are looking to build customized eCommerce solutions for clients.
Stripe is a secure payment gateway that can be integrated with most good eCommerce platforms, or used on its own to take card payments directly using its own checkout. It can be used for card payments and some other payments methods, depending on country. There is a transaction fee, but no setup fee or subscription.
Stripe has extensions to integrate with a host of other applications to help with business admin, including Xero and Slack. Payments made through Stripe are typically paid out to your nominated bank account on a schedule based on your country and industry.
Currently—probably—the best known online payment gateway to date, PayPal offers a range of payment solutions for businesses of all sizes. PayPal can be integrated with most eCommerce platforms or it can be used on its own by integrating a PayPal checkout, or embedding a PayPal button.
There are free and paid solutions and a transaction fee is charged the rate of which depends on the volume of monthly sales. Because of its high profile, PayPal is one of the more trusted payment options.
Payments made with a credit or debit card or from another PayPal account are available immediately and can be held in your PayPal wallet or withdrawn to your nominated bank account.
Authorize. Net payment gateway accepts all major credit cards as well as Apple Pay, PayPal and Visa Checkout. There is a setup fee of $49 and a monthly fee of $25 on top of the transaction fee which varies depending on whether you use the payment gateway only or the full gateway with merchant account. This also includes the ability to take payments in person, over the phone, by mail or through mobile devices. You can use Simple Checkout buttons or integrate with a certified shopping cart.
Snapppt allows your customers to shop via your Instagram feed. Or at least link directly to a specific item in your store to buy it. It’s from the people behind the SupaDupa platform, and integrates with SupaDupa stores, but also other platforms including Shopify.

"A Scottish woman given just months to live back in 2013 claims that she has cannabis oil to thank for the fact that she has been in remission for nearly four years. After being diagnosed with an incurable brain tumor, Lynn Cameron was subjected to the usual assault of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but to no avail – scans revealed no change, and doctors gave her between six and 18 months to live.
In desperation, Lynn eliminated sugar and processed foods from her diet (which was the best thing she could have done), and started researching alternative treatments. Initially skeptical about the healing powers of cannabis oil but feeling that she had nothing to lose, Lynn decided to give it a shot. Her results were nothing short of miraculous.
The Daily Mail recently reported that after suffering a sudden seizure in November 2013, Lynn was rushed to Glasgow’s Southern General Hospital, where it was determined that she had a brain tumor; she was scheduled for surgery on December 16. The surgery was not a success, however, and doctors informed her that they had been unable to get the tumor out in its entirety, that her cancer was at stage 4, and that she was terminal. Though she initially tried conventional treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation, when nothing else worked, Lynn overcame her earlier skepticism and decided to try cannabis oil.
Lynn ensured that the cannabis oil quickly and effectively entered her bloodstream by placing the drops directly under her tongue.
She told the Daily Record, “I found it hard to believe that it would cure brain cancer so advanced. Each scan I received after that was showing an improvement. I had been told that chemotherapy and radiotherapy doesn’t make much difference, so I knew it must be the cannabis doing it.By the sixth MRI, the cancer had gone.”
Though she initially kept her cannabis oil treatment secret from her oncology team, when the treatment proved to be successful, she shared the information with them. They were less than convinced, however.
Nonetheless, Lynn is far from being the only cancer patient to provide anecdotal evidence of their successful use of cannabis oil to treat this condition. And lab tests have confirmed that certain compounds in cannabis oil can kill some cancer cells.
Cannabis oil contains two main medicinal compounds: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is responsible for the “high” associated with cannabis use, and which is a powerful painkiller; and cannabidiol (CBD), which has the powerful ability to kill cancer cells without harming surrounding healthy tissue.
In the U. S. 30 states have now legalized cannabis for medicinal use, and in the U.K. CBD has been classified as a medicine for its “restoring, correcting or modifying” effects in humans, while THC has been accepted as an effective painkiller.
A recent study by researchers from the University of London found that a compound in CBD was a significant weapon against cancerous tumors in leukemia. Of course, researchers felt obliged to combine the CBD treatment with conventional chemotherapy.
The Mail reported on the researchers’ findings:
Combining existing chemotherapy treatments with cannabinoids – the active chemicals in cannabis – had better results than chemotherapy alone. The findings suggest that a lower dose of chemotherapy can be used on patients, minimising side effects of the treatment.
Of course, the researchers didn’t think to try CBD alone.
Interestingly, the study’s lead author, Dr. Wai Liu, stressed the critical importance of administering CBD after the use of chemotherapy. He noted, “We have shown for the first time that the order in which cannabinoids and chemotherapy are used is crucial in determining the overall effectiveness of this treatment.”
Of course that could be because chemotherapy is nothing but a toxic chemical cocktailthat destroys the body’s immune system, while CBD is a powerful healer that can actually kill cancer cells without damaging the body. They need to make sure you get the CBD after the chemotherapy has just about killed you.
Of course, the mainstream medical establishment would never admit that.",1
"Story highlights
Emily Bauer nearly died after her family says she smoked synthetic marijuana
The 17-year-old is in a wheelchair and partially blind, but she returned to school recently
75 people in Colorado may have become sickened after smoking synthetic marijuana
Synthetic marijuana is an herbal mixture sprayed with chemicals
Nine months after synthetic marijuana destroyed a large portion of her brain, Emily Bauer did something her parents feared they'd never see: She went back to high school.
Excited, nervous and terrified, the sophomore rolled through the hallways of Cy-Fair High School in Cypress, Texas, last week. Despite the familiar surroundings, Emily is living in a new world.
She can't read or write. She is relearning basic addition and subtraction. A rotating cast of aides help Emily get through her school day. They wheel her from class to class, assist her in the restroom, help her eat, read class material to her and take notes for her, as she is partially blind. She attends school for half the day and goes to therapy in the afternoon.
Teen narrowly escapes death after smoking synthetic marijuana
And the 17-year-old has a message for anyone who wants to try fake weed.
""The high is great, but in the long run, it isn't good,"" she said, describing her experience smoking synthetic weed. ""It's no fun to be stuck in a wheelchair, to have to go to therapy or (possibly) die.""
But she prefers to focus on the stuff she can do, like getting a perfect score on her first world history quiz. For the fiery-haired student, simply being back at school is epic.

Fake pot sends teen to ICU 01:56
Less than a year ago, in December 2012, Emily was on life support after several strokes left her paralyzed, blind and largely unaware of her surroundings. Her family has no doubt the drug that landed her in the hospital was synthetic marijuana. Her parents first believed she had only tried it a couple times. But they recently learned the extent of her use -- Emily told them she smoked it daily for the two weeks before she went to the hospital.
Best known by the street names ""Spice"" or ""K2,"" fake weed is an herbal mixture sprayed with chemicals intended to create a high similar to smoking marijuana, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Advertised as a ""legal"" alternative to weed, it's often sold as incense or potpourri and in most states, it's anything but legal.
Emily's stepfather, Tommy Bryant, told CNN last year that doctors diagnosed his daughter with vasculitis, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. The vessels going into Emily's brain were constricting, limiting blood and oxygen flow.
Emily is far from alone in her scary experience. Last week, three people in Colorado may have died after smoking the drug, according to state health officials. The Colorado Department of Public Health launched an investigation after 75 people were hospitalized in late August after using the substance.
CNN first wrote about Emily in February, after learning about her story through iReport. A lot of people were quick to say then that marijuana should be legalized so drugs like these aren't on the market. Others pointed out after the Colorado news that marijuana is legal in that state. Emily's stepfather, who has been in her life since she was born, is not interested in the debate.
""My focus is trying to get rid of this one bad product and not trying to substitute with anything else,"" said Bryant.
Bryant and his family started an organization called Synthetic Awareness For Emily to educate families, as well as teachers and doctors, about the dangers and warning signs of synthetic marijuana use. He said his goal isn't to scare students -- he just wants them to be aware that this stuff is out there.
""I'm trying to get the kids to realize that one bad decision could lead to a lifetime of pain,"" Bryant said. ""Not just for them, but for their loved ones.""
It's been a slow recovery. After months in the hospital, Emily's family had to operate a lift in their home to move Emily from the bed or from the chair. Now Emily can stand up and shift herself, so it's easier for her parents to transfer her on their own, her mother Tonya Bauer said.
She can't walk, but she's been taking physical steps at therapy sessions. Special equipment supports her body so she can focus on moving her feet.
Watch Emily learning to walk
Emily has difficulty lifting the front of her foot, also known as ""foot drop."" Her feet point straight down when she stands up, which puts her knees and hips out of alignment. The family has opted for a tendon-lengthening surgery in the near future. Her mother hopes the surgery will mean Emily will be able to walk again one day.
As Emily recovers, she and her family try to find joy in doing small things. They go out to movies and ice cream here and there, and they even took Emily to a Drake concert a few weeks ago.
Seeing Emily sing along and be a teenager again, along with watching the handicap bus whisk her off to school last week, are signs that Emily is feeling more like herself, said her parents. And here's more evidence: During her telephone interview with CNN, she sounded just like a typical 17-year-old girl.
""Our goal is to get Emily independent again so she can live on her own one day,"" said her mother. ""Having her go back to school has really made us see that this is possible.""",0
"Which sounds all nice and sweet on its own, except there was one small problem. Instead of using screened, conventional and clean milk you get from the grocery store, she decided to use her breast milk instead. The anonymous mom doesn’t get the outrage, and figured that the kids could “use the nutrition”.
Moreso, she doesn’t understand how tricking children to ingest her bodily fluids without consent or approval from the parents or child is getting so much hate.
It was shared on Facebook page Sanctimommy and went viral.
Call me a cynic, but I don’t believe her story. For one, how did anyone find out? Unless she was squirting it all over the brownies right at the sale, no one would have. It’s baked into the food. Further, you don’t need milk to make brownies. They use water!",1
"The new iPhones are on sale, which means that the older iPhone in your pocket is probably not looking as fresh and fun as it once did. But just because you’re jonesing for the hottest new tech doesn’t mean yesterday’s iPhone can’t still make your life better in a totally new way. Here are some genius ways to squeeze a bit more life out of that dated device.
It’s not just iPhones on Apple’s fall release schedule; the HomePod, a Siri-equipped smart speaker is also on the way to compete with the Amazon Echo and Alexa virtual assistant. It’s going to cost around $349, but if all you really want is a way to summon Siri from your coffee table, that trusty iPhone you’re replacing can do the trick. Leave it plugged in within earshot and say “Hey Siri” to wake it up. If you’re big on video calls, use Skype to turn it into an Echo Show of sorts, and music buffs will love that you can prompt Spotify and Pandora playback with just your voice, too.

VR headsets are pricey, but your phone can pull a lot of weight when it comes to virtual reality apps. Pick up a super cheap headset shell like the Google Cardboard, View-Master Deluxe, or Merge VR, download a few apps on your old iPhone and then slide it in. You can binge on YouTube videos or explore virtual worlds and play all kinds of mind-blowing games, all without a serious hit to your bank account.
Keeping in constant contact with your kids can feel like a must these days, but it's not always possible, especially when your signal is pooping out. If you’ve got a youngster who you want to keep tabs on, give them your old phone and the Zello app. Zello turns your old smartphone into a push-to-talk walkie talkie that can keep the lines of communication open even when signal strength is too weak for a normal cellular call, as long as you can connect to Wi-Fi. It’s perfect for having teens let you know that they made it to school or just checking in without the need to dial and wait. Super fast and incredibly easy.
You might be tempted to hand control of your mobile entertainment to your shiny new iPhone 8 or X, but your seasoned smartphone can still pull its weight. Last year I told you how to turn your iPhone into a universal remote — and that’s still a great tip, by the way — but you can get even more out of your aged iPhone by using it as an ultra-powerful radio and ebook reader, too. Snag the iHeartRadio app to stream thousands of radio stations for absolutely free, and Amazon’s Kindle app to boost your reading chops. And don’t forget that even without a cellular connection, your iPhone can still be your Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, and YouTube viewer too. You can even make that little silver screen a bit bigger with something like the retro-themed Smartphone Magnifier.
Home security cameras are high-tech and expensive, but that years-old iPhone of yours is, too. Turn it into an extra set of eyes and ears with the Presence app. The app uses your phone’s camera to keep a watchful eye on your home, and it will shoot you a timely alert if it notices that something just isn’t right. It’ll even record video of what it sees so you can decide if it’s something to worry about. Salient Eye is another great option if you want your old iPhone to watch your home, and both of these apps also work on Android devices, if you’ve got one of those lying around.

What’s the deal with alarm clocks being stuck in 1995? Every other gadget on the planet is “smart” these days, but many alarm clocks and bedside radios are as antiquated today as they were a decade ago. Ditch that old ding-dong machine and use your old iPhone instead. For music, your options are endless — Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, Apple Music — and there’s some great third party alarm apps like the Wake Alarm Clock with its big “slap to snooze” button. Add the NOAA Weather Radio and you’ll never be left wondering when severe weather is bearing down. Oh, and if you really want to class it up, pick up a fancy dock like the Bedside Smartphone Vase to complete your phone’s transformation into your new nightstand buddy.
Digital photo frames were all the rage for a while, but the convenience of smartphone photo browsing kind of rained on their parade. Now, your old iPhone is the perfect, always-on photo companion for your desk or end table without even trying. The LiveFrame app can grab photos from your iPhone’s camera roll, but it can also connect to your Facebook, Flickr, and Instagram accounts and display photos straight from the web. Just sync your accounts, set the shuffle and filter options to your liking, and let the memories play. Just remember to keep your phone plugged in, or your trip down memory lane might end unexpectedly.
For parents with newborns, a baby monitor is a must. If you have a spare iPhone, you already have one of the best baby monitors around! The Cloud Baby Monitor is just one of several really great apps for this — the simply named Baby Monitor is also a popular choice — and they both work in pretty much the same way. Your old iPhone acts as a monitoring camera, noise detector, and microphone, letting you check in on your baby whenever you want, and get alerts when the app detects crying or restlessness. Simple, cheap, and super effective.
This one isn’t so much for you as it is your four-legged furry friend, but did you know that there are iPhone games specifically for your cat? It’s true! Friskies has two very popular games for iPhone that are designed to grab your kitty’s attention and keep them entertained. JitterBug is a simple tap-the-bug game that will appease your bored feline, but my favorite is Cat Fishing 2. The bubbly sound effects and eye-catching fish that swim across the screen are like digital catnip. Both games are free, which makes turning your old iPhone into a high-tech cat toy a no-brainer.

"Solar energy is widely regarded as an innovative solution to high energy costs in the United States. It stands to reason that consumers would want to benefit from solar energy by capitalizing on solar radiation. Renewable energy sources are a viable alternative to rising electricity costs, increasing gas prices, and declining real wages. With summer in full swing, it simply makes sense to use solar radiation to decrease your monthly energy bill.
The solar panel industry has grown sharply in recent years, notably in 2016 when it experienced its best year on record. By 2020, experts anticipate that the solar panel industry will experience a 300% increase. Regardless, there are certain cost considerations to factor into the equation, and these need to be evaluated against the long-term benefits. Many homeowners have installed solar panels to raise the value of their properties. This is a strategic decision that can enhance your real estate investment and make it more attractive to buyers.
The decision to go the solar route is dependent on your personal circumstances, preferences, and budget. There is no blanket answer to the question: Is solar right for you? However, the benefits available through use of solar panels do not discriminate along income lines, or demographics. There are many inherent pluses when selecting solar power as your new energy source. For starters, it is environmentally friendly, and this bodes well for anyone who cares about the planet.
There is a limited carbon footprint, no unnecessary wastage of limited resources, and a virtually unlimited supply of energy to feed the system. While it certainly takes work to create the solar panels, once they have been produced, the benefits generated through them far outweigh the cons. Decreased use of fossil fuels, and traditional electricity are considered the primary reasons for adopting solar energy.
Once the solar panels have been installed, the cost savings begin accruing. However, it’s important to note that solar panel cost savings must be factored into the long-term projection. The initial outlay for solar energy panels is high, but it is falling fast. Once the panels have been installed on your roof, they soak up the sun’s energy and convert it into electrical energy to heat your pool, your boiler, and power your house.
In summer, the electricity bills are often higher, owing to the air-conditioning units that are in constant use. Solar panels can help lower your energy bill during the summer months, resulting in sharp savings. At state and federal level, households intending on installing solar panels will receive a break from the federal government, and often at state level too. These are reflected in the form of tax credits and incentives. Various studies (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) have been commissioned over the years, and they confirm that solar panels can improve your home’s value by as much as $15,000.
On the flip side, there is an initial investment required to get the solar panels installed. This may prove prohibitive for some households, but the long-term benefits have already been established. It is possible for costs to reach several thousand dollars, but many solar panel companies offer affordable payment plans to help clients with the upfront costs.
The long-term benefits of installing solar panels are ironclad, but if you move home you may not recoup the costs. Fortunately, they raise the value of your real estate and this can mitigate any losses that rack up. Another factor to bear in mind is that solar energy costs are decreasing. This industry is growing larger every year, and it is reaching an ‘economies of scale’ stage. The costs will invariably decrease, making them far more attractive to homeowners in the future. However, when that point is reached, it is unlikely that the federal government and state governments will offer tax breaks and incentives to homeowners.",1
"HUMAN GENE EDITING: A summary overview of the science, research, regulations, ethics and hazards of Gene Editing/CRISPR
An International Summit on Human Gene Editing hosted by the US National Academy of Sciences, the US National Academy of Medicine, the UK Royal Society and the Chinese Academy of Sciences took place on December 1-3, 2015 in Washington to discuss the scientific, ethical, legal and regulatory issues associated with “Gene Editing” human DNA for both research, clinical and personal “enhancement” applications. A summary of the Summit is available at the following link. Following the Summit, the Organizing Committee Members issued the following Summit Statement on Gene Editing human DNA for research and its potential applications.
A “Committee of Experts” has also been selected and mandated to “perform its own independent and in-depth review of the science and policy of human gene editing by reviewing the literature and holding data-gathering meetings in the U. S. and abroad to solicit broad input from researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and the public. The committee will also monitor in real-time the latest scientific achievements of importance in this rapidly developing field. Finally, while informed by the statement issued by the organizing committee for the international summit, the study committee will have broad discretion to arrive at its own findings and conclusions, which will be released in a peer-reviewed consensus report. Expected to be completed in late 2016, the report will represent the official views of NAS and NAM.” Source
The Committee held its first meeting in February 2015 in Washington to discuss the scientific, medical, legal, regulatory and ethical issues surrounding Gene Editing of human DNA. The Committee also organized both a workshop in Paris in April 2015 hosted by the Federation of European Academies of Medicine to “focus on the state of the science and international regulatory landscape regarding human gene editing,” as well as a meeting at the French National Academy of Medicine in Paris “focused on the principles underlying human gene editing governance and policy.” You can view both events at this link and you can watch a video of the Paris meeting at the following link. Details about the Committee’s work and study is available at this link.
Gene “editing” human DNA – the sacrosanct essence and blueprint of Life – poses a myriad of extremely alarming issues and irreversible hazards to the very essence, nature and future survival of humanity and of all Life on this planet. As the Committee members of the Summit themselves admit and write in the Summit Statement:
“Gene editing might also be used, in principle, to make genetic alterations in gametes or embryos, which will be carried by all of the cells of a resulting child and will be passed on to subsequent generations as part of the human gene pool. Examples that have been proposed range from avoidance of severe inherited diseases to ‘enhancement’ of human capabilities. Such modifications of human genomes might include the introduction of naturally occurring variants or totally novel genetic changes thought to be beneficial.
Germline editing poses many important issues, including: (i) the risks of inaccurate editing (such as off-target mutations) and incomplete editing of the cells of early-stage embryos (mosaicism); (ii) the difficulty of predicting harmful effects that genetic changes may have under the wide range of circumstances experienced by the human population, including interactions with other genetic variants and with the environment; (iii) the obligation to consider implications for both the individual and the future generations who will carry the genetic alterations; (iv) the fact that, once introduced into the human population, genetic alterations would be difficult to remove and would not remain within any single community or country; (v) the possibility that permanent genetic ‘enhancements’ to subsets of the population could exacerbate social inequities or be used coercively; and (vi) the moral and ethical considerations in purposefully altering human evolution using this technology.”
Earlier in 2015, several American scientists including two Nobel Prize winners called for a debate on the genetic engineering of humans, warning that the technology able to change the DNA of future generations is now “imminent.”
Meanwhile, Another group of scientists published a statement in which they said that it was “irresponsible” to create genetically modified babies/humans at this point in time without ruling out the possibility and desire to do so in the future:
“Almost everyone says it’s premature for clinical use and there should be a delay, but it doesn’t mean it should be ruled out forever; it’s like stem-cell research. It needs to be regulated but without too much constraint or endangering the whole enterprise.” said Richard Hynes, the MIT cancer biologist who co-chairs the Human Gene Editing study. A separate group of scientists working within the biotech industry have also published a statement warning that “scientists should agree not to modify the DNA of human reproductive cells” because it raises safety and ethical risks including the danger of “unpredictable effects on future generations.”
Dr. Jonathan Latham – a prominent scientific expert on biotechnology – debunks the myths surrounding the incessantly repeated misleading and fraudulent claims of the purported “precision,” “accuracy” and “efficiency” of Gene Editing/CRISPR.
“can induce mutations at sites that differ by as many as five nucleotides from the intended target”, i.e. CRISPR may act at unknown sites in the genome where it is not wanted (u et al., 2014). So far, it is technically not possible to make a single (and only a single) genetic change to a genome using CRISPR and be sure one has done so (Fichtner et al., 2014). As Fichtner noted “in mammalian systems Cas9 causes a high degree of off-target effects”. And at least until modified versions come into use, this will limit the safety, and hopefully limit the application, of CRISPR and related biotechnologies. There is, furthermore, no guarantee that more precise versions of CRISPR are even biologically possible. Technically therefore, precision is a myth: no form of genome editing can do what is currently being claimed.
The second key error of CRISPR boosters is to assume that, even if we had complete precision, this would allow control over the consequences for the resulting organism. A classic example of how DNA can still reveal unexpected functions decades after discovery is the CaMV 35S promoter, a DNA sequence used in commercialised GMO plants for almost twenty years. The CaMV 35S DNA is described in every application for commercial use as a simple DNA “promoter” (an “on” switch for gene expression).
In 1999, however, the CaMV 35S “promoter” was found to encode a recombinational hotspot (Kohli et al., 1999). In 2011 it was found to produce massive quantities of small RNAs. These RNAs probably function as decoys to neutralise the plant immune system (Blevins et al., 2011). One year later still, regulators found it to contain an overlapping viral gene whose functions are still being elucidated (Podevin and du Jardin 2012). Will we ever know enough about any DNA sequence to accurately describe changing it as “editing”?
The third error of CRISPR advocates is to imply that changes to gene functions can be presumed to be discrete and constrained. The concept of the precise editing of a genome leading to a precise biological outcome depends heavily on the conception that genes give rise to simple outputs. This is the genetic paradigm taught in schools. It is also the paradigm presented to the public and that even plays a large role in the thinking of molecular genetic researchers.
However, a defined, discrete or simple pathway from gene to trait probably never exists. Most gene function is mediated murkily through highly complex biochemical and other networks that depend on many conditional factors, such as the presence of other genes and their variants, on the environment, on the age of the organism, on chance, and so forth. Geneticists and molecular biologists, however, since the time of Gregor Mendel, have striven to find or create artificial experimental systems in which environmental or any other sources of variation are minimised so as not to distract from the more “important” business of genetic discovery.
This is not my argument. Source
Several other prominent scientists and researchers have also debunked the myths regarding the oft-repeated misleading claims of precision and accuracy of Gene Editing/CRISPR.
Chinese scientists were the first researchers in the world to edit the genomes of “non viable” human embryos. The Chinese researchers unsuccessfully attempted to modify the gene responsible for β-thalassaemia, a potentially fatal blood disorder, using a gene-editing technique known as CRISPR/Cas9. However, in a published paper, the researchers explain and admit that their experiments were a total failure and they reveal serious obstacles to using Gene Editing/CRISPR in medical applications.
“The scientist injected 86 embryos and then waited 48 hours, enough time for the CRISPR/Cas9 system and the molecules that replace the missing DNA to act — and for the embryos to grow to about eight cells each. Of the 71 embryos that survived, 54 were genetically tested. This revealed that just 28 were successfully spliced, and that only a fraction of those contained the replacement genetic material. “If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%,” Huang says. “That’s why we stopped. We still think it’s too immature.”
The researchers also found a surprising number of ‘off-target’ mutations assumed to be introduced by the CRISPR/Cas9 complex acting on other parts of the genome. This effect is one of the main safety concerns surrounding Germline gene editing because these unintended mutations could be harmful. The rates of such mutations were much higher than those observed in gene-editing studies of mouse embryos or human adult cells. And Huang notes that his team likely only detected a subset of the unintended mutations because their study looked only at a portion of the genome, known as the exome. “If we did the whole genome sequence, we would get many more,” Huang alarmingly admits.
“I believe this is the first report of CRISPR/Cas9 applied to human pre-implantation embryos and as such the study is a landmark, as well as a cautionary tale,” says George Daley, a stem-cell biologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. “Their study should be a stern warning to any practitioner who thinks the technology is ready for testing to eradicate disease genes.” Source
Other scientists have also warned about the dangers of Gene Editing DNA in human embryos:
“In our view, genome editing in human embryos using current technologies could have unpredictable effects on future generations. This makes it dangerous and ethically unacceptable. Such research could be exploited for non-therapeutic modifications.”
However, despite the alarming findings and dismal failure of the first Chinese experiment editing “non-viable” human embryos and the warnings of other researchers about the hazards of Gene/Germline Editing/CRISPR, another team of researchers in China have alarmingly recently reported “editing” the genes of “non viable” human embryos to try to make them resistant to HIV infection. Their published paper is the second published claim of gene editing human embryos using CRISPR.
In February 2016, research scientists in London/UK have alarmingly been granted permission by the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to “edit” the genomes of “viable” human embryos for research. The approval by the UK HFEA represents the world’s first regulatory approval of Gene Editing using CRISPR on “viable” human embryos for research.
On April 22, 2016 a Japanese government bioethics panel approved gene modifications of fertilized human eggs for research purposes.
The EU law regulating GMO’s defines a GMO as: “Any organism, with the exception of humans, in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating or natural recombination”. Source
According to a recent expert legal opinion published by EU legal experts Tade Spranger and Ludwig Krmer, animals, plants and other living organisms whose genes have been “edited” using Gene Editing/CRISPR fall under the EU definition of GMO’s and should therefore be regulated under the EU law regulating GMO’s.
However, both the industry and the US administration are lobbying regulatory agencies in both the EU i.e. European Commission and in the US to deregulate Gene Editing/CRISPR by fraudulently arguing that living organisms i.e. animals, plants, etc. whose genes have been “edited” do not contain foreign DNA and therefore should not be regulated as a GMO. The following document provides an overview of US pressure to deregulate Gene Editing in the EU.
In the US, the USDA has approved and deregulated a gene-edited corn from Dupont and deregulated and approved a Gene Edited mushroom:“APHIS does not consider CRISPR/Cas9-edited white button mushrooms as described in your October 30, 2015 letter to be regulated,” the agency wrote in a April 13 letter to the applicant.
However, the federal US National Institute of Health (NHI) has stated that it will not provide funding for Germline editing; in a published letter, the NHI stated: ” NIH will not fund any use of gene-editing technologies in human embryos. The concept of altering the human germline in embryos for clinical purposes has been debated over many years from many different perspectives, and has been viewed almost universally as a line that should not be crossed. Advances in technology have given us an elegant new way of carrying out genome editing, but the strong arguments against engaging in this activity remain. These include the serious and unquantifiable safety issues, ethical issues presented by altering the germline in a way that affects the next generation without their consent, and a current lack of compelling medical applications justifying the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in embryos.”
Not only is the science primitive, deeply flawed and extremely hazardous, but it is also highly unethical. In fact, DNA is the sacrosanct essence and blueprint of human life and of all Life on this planet. Therefore, it is both highly unethical and extremely hazardous to allow mad and morally bankrupt pseudo-scientists suffering from severe megalomania to play God and Lego with our DNA and by extension with the DNA of countless yet unborn future generations.
Moreover, Gene/Germline Editing/CRISPR can and will be misused for eugenics purposes.
Eugenics was embraced and infamously practiced by Hitler and the NAZI’s during WW2 to sterilize and kill hundreds of millions of so-called “inferior” members of the human race i.e. Jews, the crippled, the feeble-minded, etc. under the NAZI’s racial purification theory and program (i.e. Holocaust) and the purported and proclaimed superiority of the so-called “Aryan” master race.
However, eugenism as an offshoot of the Darwinian theory of evolution and racial superiority (i.e. Survival of the fittest) took roots both in the UK and in the US well before the rise to power of Hitler; in fact eugenics was embraced, preached, financed and practiced by a large majority of the Darwinian ruling and moneyed so-called “elite” in the US in the early twentieth century.
Unfortunately eugenism has not died with Hitler; in fact, it has been resurrected and is covertly practiced throughout the world through scientific and technologically more advanced tools and means i.e. through the forceful and mandatory administration of sterilizing/poisonous vaccines, fluoridated water, toxic GMO’s, poisonous chemicals copiously sprayed on our food crops, soil, water, air and environment, by many of the same ruling and moneyed families and corporations that embraced, preached, financed and practiced eugenism both in the US and in Nazi Germany.
The methods have changed but the actors and the objectives remain unchanged. In fact, many of the same ruling and moneyed so-called “elite” families that embraced eugenism in the US in the early 20thcentury are today major funders and shareholders of the biotech/chemical/pharmaceutical industry. And many of the biotech/chemical/pharmaceutical corporations that today manufacturer toxic vaccines, genetically modify our food crops and copiously spray their poisonous chemicals on our food supply, soil, water, air and environment are remnants and offshoots of the infamous IG Farben – the Nazi petrochemical industrial conglomerate. Toxic food for thought…
Suffice it here to predict and to warn that Gene/Germline Editing/CRISPR will also – like GMO’s – be patented, exploited and misused by profit-oriented corporations, corrupt and criminal fascist governments, the Military Industrial Complex and the Darwinian ruling and moneyed “elite” for profit, power, control, eugenics, war and other malevolent purposes and destructive ends.
Several books could be written on the links between biotechnology and eugenics. It is infantile, primitive and beyond stupid for the proponents and advocates of eugenics to claim and to believe that they can produce a race of “supermen” using Gene/Germline Editing/CRISPR. You cannot simply delete “stupid” genes and replace them with “intelligent” ones; or “cut” so-called “undesirable” or “faulty” genes and “copy” and “paste” desirable ones for good health, intelligence, wisdom, integrity, etc. Instead of creating a class of so-called “supermen,” the mad scientists and their sponsors will create monstrous human chimeras and irreversibly alter and destroy human DNA in the process…
There are also crucial legal issues that need to be addressed and answered; for instance, corporations and governments can and will patent, exploit and misuse the Gene/Germline Editing/CRISPR technology. What would be the resulting legal consequences on the lives of humans and their offspring who had their genes “edited” ? What would be the legal definition and the legal rights of a genetically modified embryo and human being…? And who would own the resulting genetically modified embryo and human being…?
To summarize and to conclude, the science is not only primitive, flawed, extremely dangerous and unregulated but also highly unethical. Gene/Germline Editing/CRISPR will literally and irreversibly change our DNA and the DNA of all yet unborn future generations – the sacrosanct essence and blueprint of human Life and of all Life on this planet.
We cannot allow mad and morally bankrupt scientists suffering from severe megalomania play God and Lego with our DNA. Corporations, governments and the Industrial Military Complex can and will patent the technology and can and will exploit and misuse the technology for profit, power, control, eugenics, war and other malevolent and destructive ends. Human history is filled with repeated, countless and endless tragic examples of science and technology being misused for profit, power, control, war and other malevolent and destructive ends.
If humanity allows mad and morally bankrupt pseudo-scientists and their sponsors to play God and “edit” their DNA, humanity will open Pandora’s box and wake up in a monstrous dystopian world of genetically modified human chimeras and other monstrous chimeras life forms in next 15-30 years…
Gene/Germline Editing/CRISPR poses a greater threat and danger to the very near future survival of humanity and of all Life on this planet than nuclear weapons and all the Weapons of Mass Destruction devised by “scientists” and used against humanity to this day. In fact, James Clapper, U. S. director of national intelligence, has recently alarmingly added and classified Gene Editing/CRISPR to a list of threats posed by “weapons of mass destruction and proliferation” in his Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community.
“Given the broad distribution, low cost, and accelerated pace of development of this dual-use technology, its deliberate or unintentional misuse might lead to far-reaching economic and national security implications. Research in genome editing conducted by countries with different regulatory or ethical standards than those of Western countries probably increases the risk of the creation of potentially harmful biological agents or products,” the report alarmingly states.
“The intelligence assessment drew specific attention to the possibility of using CRISPR to edit the DNA of human embryos to produce genetic changes in the next generation of people—for example, to remove disease risks. It noted that fast advances in genome editing in 2015 compelled “groups of high-profile U. S. and European biologists to question unregulated editing of the human germ line (cells that are relevant for reproduction), which might create inheritable genetic changes.
So far, the debate over changing the next generation’s genes has been mostly an ethical question, and the report didn’t say how such a development would be considered a WMD, although it’s possible to imagine a virus designed to kill or injure people by altering their genomes,” writes Antonio Regalado, senior editor for biomedicine at MIT Technology Review.

Hopefully humanity will wake up from its deadly slumber before it wakes up in a dystopian world of monstrous genetically modified human chimeras…

What is the budget for the room makeovers?  It varies by homeowner. Homeowners set a budget for the room based on what they are willing to spend, and that is passed along to the designer. The designer works within that budget to make it a realistic makeover for the homeowner. The designer is allowed to go over budget only with the “splurge” options. Budgets generally are at least $3,000 and occasionally much more.  Who pays for the makeover?  The design itself is done at no cost to homeowners. The Washington Post assigns the rooms to designers, who do the work for free. They send us a detailed design packet, and we work with the illustrator to edit the packet down to the main points that appear in print and online. With complex designs that include many details not included in the print version or illustration, we send the homeowners the complete design packet with all of the designer’s suggestions. Once they set the budget and receive the suggestions, homeowners can implement as little or as much of the design plan as they want, at their own cost.  What restrictions do designers have to work with?  In addition to the budget constraints, designers are not allowed to do major renovations to the structure of the room (unless the homeowner has specifically indicated plans to take on such a project). They cannot use products that are to-the-trade or one-of-a-kind items, as everything has to be something that can be linked in the shopping guide and available to the homeowners as well as readers. We don’t allow them to use items from their own stores. We also don’t let them use products from Etsy.com or temporary sale sites such as Joss and Main or One King’s Lane, because those items are usually limited in quantity or only available for a short time. We ask them to choose items from a variety of stores.  How do you choose the rooms?  Homeowners e-mail us their challenges, photos of the room and what they want to get out of the process. We try to pick a variety of rooms and houses and include a range of budgets. We also look for rooms that have challenges or problems to solve, rather than just a straight room makeover. We do not use rooms from outside the Washington area.  How much time passes between when a room is chosen and when it appears in the paper?  Usually at least two months, and it can be as long as five months.  What happens after a room is chosen?  We collect more information, including a budget, design preferences and likes and dislikes. We ask homeowners what colors they prefer and where they most often shop, or what style they are drawn to. We compile all of that, along with homeowner’s photos, and send it to a designer, who then works on a proposal. We also send a professional photographer out to take “before” pictures of the space and a portrait of the homeowner. The designer sends the completed packet to us and the illustrator to have his or her vision translated into what appears in print and online.   How do you choose designers?  We have a list of designers we’ve worked with in the past, and we often get requests from new designers who are interested in participating. Generally, we try not to use the same designer more than once in a 12-month period.

Picture a security camera, and you'll probably think of bulky, ugly cameras that save video to a memory card. They don’t look good in our homes, which means we often try to hide them away in a corner. But the Nest Cam IQ is different.
As security cameras go, the Nest Cam IQ looks beautiful. It comes in a crisp, clean white color with a very minimalist package. It's held up by a narrow stem and only has one lone power cable. Heck, even the charger looks gorgeous.
But for as pretty as this camera is, it costs $299 and doesn’t seem to raise the bar as high above other cameras as Nest claims it does. That's especially true when compared to Nest’s $199 Cam Indoor and $199 Cam Outdoor.
It still offers a lot of features: 1080p video, person alerts, familiar face alerts, night vision, a CSI-style zoom and enhance feature, two-way audio dubbed “HD Talk and Listen”, activity zones you can create to focus or block alerts on a specific area, and more. There's also “Supersight,” which Nest dubs the combination of a 4K sensor, HDR, and close-up tracking, where the camera zooms in on and follows people moving through the frame.
The thing is, most of these features are also available on the more affordable Nest Cam and Nest Cam Outdoor. All three cameras take 1080p video and offer night vision, alerts, and two-way audio. The difference is that the Nest Cam IQ offers HD two-way audio and can process person alerts without a Nest Aware subscription (more on that below), thanks to its more-powerful on-board processor.
The Cam IQ also works with the Nest app, naturally, allowing you to view the Cam IQ’s ""Sightline"" video feed in concert with other Nest devices (if you own them). The app packs a lot of features, but most of them are buried in settings—which helps simplify the experience by focusing on the camera feed. If you have a Nest Aware subscription, you can scroll back in time through your camera feed and see what you missed.
The best smart indoor security cameras of 2017
The best smart outdoor security cameras of 2017
It’s still a very powerful security camera, but with a $300 price tag, it might not be for everyone.
These two features are what really sets the Nest Cam IQ apart from its older siblings. “Supersight” is Nest’s name for the new 4K HDR sensor and close-up tracking this cam offers. The camera shoots in 1080p (streaming 4K footage to the cloud would eat up a lot of bandwidth), but can zoom in on movement and people that it detects, even following them as they walk through the frame.
And thanks to the 4K sensor, you can zoom in on an area of the frame you’d like to watch and enhance it to get a clearer picture, just like on CSI! You can’t do this after the fact since the camera only records in 1080p, but it’s handy if you have to place the camera far away from the area you’d like to monitor.
You might find this feature a bit creepy (many of my colleagues did), but the Cam IQ has a unique feature called “familiar faces” that you can use if you subscribe to Nest Aware. It will collect and group screenshots of faces, allowing you to name the people that the cam sees. It will also send a notification with a screenshot to your phone when it detects an unfamiliar face.
It’s an interesting, if creepy, feature, but outside of being a way to be extra vigilant about who is in your home(perhaps if you're the parent of teenagers?), I can’t seem to find a real purpose for it. However if it’s a feature that interests you, it is available with a Nest Aware subscription.
The HD Talk and Listen (or two-way audio) feature seems to offer somewhat improved audio over competing cameras, with a speaker that Nest claims is seven times more powerful than the Nest Cam Indoor. But on the mobile app, the feature only allows you hear people when you aren’t speaking through the microphone.
On the Nest website, you are able to leave the mic on and still hear people, which makes it much easier to have a conversation. Nest tells me that this will be fixed later this summer, but at launch it just seems like a weird bug to leave in place.
Perhaps the thing I disliked the most about the Nest Cam IQ is that so many features are tied to a Nest Aware subscription. I will admit, the subscription service works well, and you might think it’s worth the money. But there are a few features—like the ability to save and download video clips—that most competing cams offer for free.
For example, the Logi Circle, our favorite indoor cam, offers 24 hours cloud storage and the ability to save clips for free. And Netgear’s Arlo Pro, our Best Value pick for outdoor cams, offers seven days of free cloud storage. Without Nest Aware, you’ll only get still snapshots from your cam for the past three hours of use.
Despite the competition, Nest keeps charging a premium for its cloud features. And perhaps you’re okay paying for them. But given the high initial cost of the Nest Cam IQ, I’d expect to get a bit more for the money.
The Nest Cam IQ is a beautiful and well-designed product. It also offers great software features that others cams can’t compete with. But Nest’s other two cams are almost just as good, offer almost identical features (especially with a Nest Aware subscription), and cost $100 less.
I think it’s a great security camera, but I’d personally rather get a regular Nest Cam or a competitor with free cloud storage. If you’ve invested in the Nest ecosystem or find the 4K “Supersight” and “zoom and enhance” features very compelling, I have no doubt you’ll love this camera. But in its current form, I don’t think it does enough to differentiate itself from its siblings and make it worth the extra money.",0
"When we look at the world around us, we don't see everything. We can't.
Humans evolved in a very specific environment and adapted to maximize their chances of surviving in it. We are creatures of the Earth, a planet bathed in radiation from a star with a surface temperature of about 6,000 degrees Celsius (about 10,800 degrees Fahrenheit). A star's surface temperature determines the kind of radiation it emits the most, what we call its peak power. What gets down to Earth's surface, after the atmosphere filters and scatters it, fuels animals to ultimately fulfill their two most essential needs: to eat and to reproduce.
It is thus no wonder that most surface animals see in what we call the ""visible window"" of the electromagnetic spectrum, roughly the colors of the rainbow. Those frequencies correspond to the sun's peak output. Some species see in infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths as opposed to the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, or use smells to guide them; others, like bats, use echolocation to move about. But most ground-dwelling diurnal species use visible light. Successful life forms are those that can best make use of the resources around them so as to optimize the survival chances of their reproductive output.
Given our evolutionary history and the planet we live on, we capture that fraction of reality that is most useful for our survival. This means that there is a whole lot around us that we don't see or know exists. But the fact that we can't see or perceive parts of reality doesn't make it less real. Quite the opposite; that's where the possibilities of growth are, where what seems impossible in our immediate reality may actually not be. Humans have an urge to explore the unknown, what lies beyond their immediate reach. This may be our species' most distinguishable trait.
Animals want to be safe, living within familiar boundaries that don't expose them to any extra risk. They keep to their tried, well-adapted behavioral patterns, a recipe that allows them to thrive. Even migrant animals are not explorers: Deviating from their roots can be deadly. Humans, on the other hand, have a need to lunge into the unknown, to expose themselves to what is uncomfortable, even threatening. We take risks as individuals and as a species, continually pushing ourselves beyond established limits. We like our boundaries elastic, safe but expandable.
As with the physical, so with the mental. We take risks with knowledge, with ways of expressing our thoughts and feelings. Science is much more than a mere description of the natural world; it's our commitment to exploring the unknown, an expression of the very human urge to constantly redefine who we are by expanding our realm of existence. As our view of the world changes, so does our understanding of our place in it and the meaning of our humanity. In this, science joins the arts as an expression of what is most precious to us, our search for meaning.
Circling back to the limits of science and knowledge in general, we can see why they are essential. They are the gateways to invisible realms around us. If we can't see tiny microbes or faraway stars with the naked eye, we invent microscopes and telescopes to expand our vision. If we can't see inside our bodies or underwater, we invent X-ray machines and sonar to expand our vision. What we call reality is constantly shifting, as we expand our reach into the unknown.
As long as scientists have funds to keep exploring, there's no end to this pursuit. And that's how it should be. We need the thrill of pursuing new knowledge. We want to push those elastic boundaries of our perceived reality outward. The real defeat is to believe that there is an end to this quest. Imagine how sad it would be if we one day arrived at the end of knowledge. No new fundamental questions to explore, no boundaries to expand, no great discoveries ahead. Only tiny adjustments here and there to what is already known.
Remarkably, many scientists and thinkers have speculated that this would indeed happen, that one day we would arrive at the end of knowledge. Some even declared we were there already. I am thus glad to report that these people were wrong. Given the very nature of knowledge, every discovery starts in ignorance. We use what we know to propel us into the unknown. New discoveries may answer a few questions but invariably create new ones. Indeed, the more fundamental the new discovery, the more fruitful it will be, as it will open doors that we couldn't have contemplated beforehand.
Knowledge starts in ignorance and generates new knowledge that generates more ignorance. Such is the wondrous nature of knowledge, the endless pursuit.

"A week after NFL protests, high school teams weigh decision to demonstrate during anthem
The Surrattsville High School football team stretches before practice on Thursday. (Jacob Bogage/The Washington Post)    These conversations started a long time ago, in offseason weight rooms, in car rides home, during film study at lunchtime, on the walk from the locker room to the practice field and back again. Being a black young man in America is hard, Surrattsville Coach Cornell Wade tells his players, so come talk to him about it. They do. They ask about girls or problems at home or difficult classes, but they also stop by when they see news stories about black men their age getting shot and killed by police. And then Colin Kaepernick, in 2016, knelt down during the playing of the national anthem at NFL games to protest police brutality and racial economic inequality, and has found himself without a team this season.  [Louisiana high school will kick students off team if they don’t stand for national anthem]  More NFL players joined Kaepernick’s peaceful demonstration during the anthem, and President Trump last week called any player who took a knee a“son of a bitch” and told NFL owners to fire players who decline to stand for “The Star-Spangled Banner.” “It gives me a burning sensation to think about,” Surrattsville senior wide receiver Colin Dupree said. In response, players at every NFL game last weekend made some sort of demonstration during the anthem. This week, high school football players and coaches around the D. C. area wrestled with the decision to do the same, while administrators offered guidance.  Wade’s Surrattsville Hornets, staring down one of their biggest games of the season against Eleanor Roosevelt on Friday, were thinking about kneeling. Some players were adamant that the Prince George’s County school, whose student body is 89 percent black, needs to make a statement on the field. Others wanted to, but have family serving nearby at Joint Base Andrews and worr ied what parents or siblings might say after the game. So they have talked about it,senior lineman Steven Avents Jr. said, first among themselves and then with Wade. They were supposed to take a vote after school Friday, but never got around to it, then got mixed up in the locker room during game preparation and didn’t make it out to the field for the anthem after all. It was a complete accident, Wade said, but maybe not the worst thing in the world. “These conversations happen in a high school locker room,” the coach said earlier in the week.“These are young men who have opinions and have feelings. I don’t know what they’re going to say, but I want them to know they have a voice.”  [From Freddie Gray through Ray Lewis, Baltimore stands at center of anthem debate]  Ed Shields, the head coach at Suitland High School (also in Prince George’s County), gathered his team after warmups Wednesday and told them he knew the anthem was on their minds. “What do y’all think?” he asked.“What should we do?” “They just started talking,” Shields said. “That moved into conversation. Some of them were interested. Some of them said, ‘That’s not for us.’ “They said, ‘We don’t want any distractions from our season, but we can do other things in support, if you feel a certain way. You just don’t have to do it here.’ I could have not been there, and I think it would have ended the same way.” Suitland will not demonstrate during the anthem, the team decided. In Montgomery County, members of Blair’s cheerleading team did kneel in protest as the Einstein High band played the national anthem before the teams’ football game Thursday night. As a few cheerleaders who had never before protested during the anthem went down on one knee, several members of the team looked at the squad’s coach, Sara Rykoskey. “Make sure you’re doing it because you want to kneel, not because you’re seeing everybody else do it,” she said she told them. Quan’ell Kitchen, a sophomore cheerleader, has knelt during the anthem at every game this season to protest “racial injustice,” she said, a practice she started during her freshman year on the softball team. A Blair fan told her she needed to“stand up and respect your country.” “I can’t respect a country that doesn’t respect my race,” she said later. Many local school districts, including Montgomery and Prince George’s counties in Maryland and Loudoun County in Virginia, issued guidance to coaches not to punish, reprimand or embarrass students who did not stand for the anthem. Other school systems told The Washington Post they previously had addressed students’ rights to abstain from patriotic demonstrations at school.  [Focus on anthem protests and Trump vs. the NFL not likely to fade soon]  “Public school students have a first amendment right to opt out of singing the national anthem and to engage in other peaceful, non-disruptive protests of political or social issues at school,” Loudoun County schools athletics supervisor Derek Farrey wrote in an email to coaches. “A coach should not require or encourage his players to sit or kneel for the national anthem.” Some coaches reached by The Post said they wouldn’t be discussing the issue with their players, and some said they did not anticipate any of their players participating in any form of protest. At Surrattsville, Wade said he would not tell his players what he thinks the team ought to do. He’s happy already, he said, that players feel comfortable enough to talk about personal issues or tragedies in the news, events players say consistently target black men. “We’re at the bottom of the totem pole,” said Dupree, the wide receiver, “and we’ve been at the bottom of the totem pole forever, for like 200 years, now.” He and teammates had researched anthem protests before deliberating with the rest of the varsity squad. They reread the Bill of Rights, they said, and looked up statistics on economic inequality, mass incarceration and police violence. They know what they are talking about, Avents, the lineman, said: “[Trump] has the right to say what he wants to say, but we have the right to say what we want to say. We respond in a way where we still respect that flag, but we can send you a message, too.”      Titans’ Delanie Walker says he’s had death threats since his comments on anthem protest   A kid walked into a GameStop wearing a Kaepernick jersey. Two NFL players bought him an Xbox.   Packers, Bears and some Green Bay fans link arms after Trump continues attacks on NFL players",0

It’s a rule: Trigger-happy photographers end up with countless bad pictures. They snap away, not caring about framing or the Rule of Thirds because they’re just hoping that one of those shots ends up perfect.
Luckily, you can delete those extra shots, especially the ones that tested the exposure or are obscured by the shooter’s thumb. In fact, you should delete them, not just because they’re embarrassing because they clog your hard drive with needless images and make your albums harder to organize.
If you’re using Apple Photos, the face recognition feature is extremely easy to use. Just go to “Faces” and find the row of “Suggested Faces.” Double-click on any of the people you see, and you can confirm or deny which faces belong to that specific friend or family member. This is an easy way to create albums based on people who are close to you.
Apple doesn’t have the monopoly on face recognition, but many Windows programs require an extra step or even an additional plugin.
Tip in a Tip: Whether you're attending a wedding, birthday party, family reunion or other special event, one of the best things is sharing the photos you've captured. Rather than email your photos back and forth to each other, click here for a much better method.
Looking for a document is easy. You just type its title into your finder, and the document should appear. But images are harder to sift through. How do you make your photos searchable? Change their metadata.
Metadata is basically the hard information that is embedded in every photo, such as the date and location that it was taken. Many photos document the type of camera, lens, and exposure, as well. Adding keywords and tags make your photos easier to track down. If you’ve visited the Grand Canyon on several occasions, you can tag all of these with “Grand Canyon,” and you’ll be able to track them all down, even if they’re located in different folders.
In Photos, you just click a picture and then hit the “i” icon at the top of the screen. A small window will show you the metadata, and you can instantly add keywords and tags.
When looking at a photo file’s name, you can usually right click for “info.” This will reveal the photo’s metadata, and you can add specific tags there.
Putting together files is an art because you have to anticipate what photos you’ll be seeking in the future. Keywords help enormously, but sometimes you want to find a whole batch of photos that aren’t exactly related.
You know yourself well, and you know how you’ll end up looking for things. You’ll likely end up putting all the photos from your Cancun vacation in a file marked “Cancun,” and if you travel a lot, the “Cancun” and “Virgin Islands” and “NYC” photos will all end up in a file called “Travel,” and so on.
Even if you have plenty of gigabytes available, you’ll want to back up the pictures that you have online. Here are a few ways.
Apple: When you sign up foriCloud, you automatically get5GBof free storage. If you use all of youriCloudstorage, you can buy more starting at 50GB for $0.99 a month. To see how much iCloud storage you are using, go to Apple menu > System Preferences. Then, select iCloud to view your total and available storage.
Google Drive: This virtual storage site comes with every Google account. Once you open your Gmail, find the features icon in the upper right-hand corner (it looks like nine interlocking squares) and find Google Drive. This will grant you 15 GB of space, which is the equivalent of about 1,500 high-res photos of 10 MB each. Alternatively, use Google Photos that’s specifically designed for images. When uploading select “High Quality,” and you have unlimited photo storage. These images can be no more than 16 megapixels in size.
Amazon Photos: Among the many perks of an Amazon Prime membership, you get Prime Photos, which provides unlimited photo storage. The service also offers its own app, which can help you organize your photos on the go. Remember, a Prime membership costs $99, so it’s far from free. But aside from its capacity to organize, Prime Photo is also compatible with Alexa, so you can give commands like, “Play a slideshow,” and “Show me photos of Jane.”
Tip in a Tip: Like most people, you probably signed up for Amazon Prime for one reason. Maybe it was the free shipping. Maybe it was the streaming videos or the free music. But even now, several years after Amazon Prime was founded, few people know the full breadth of their membership perks. Click here for a master list of everything you get with your Amazon Prime account.
Flickr: I’m very suspicious of Flickr. Yahoo owns the site and its been having epidemic security problems lately. But Flickr helped create the online photo phenomenon, and it’s still a high-quality venue with lots of sharing options. Flickr offers 1TB of storage, which is a colossal amount of space. Like Google Photos, you can easily create physical portraits, photos on canvas, and photo books.

"He is sometimes known as the Indiana Jones of his area of research — ancient ales, wines and extreme beverages. Others call him Dr. Pat.
Patrick McGovern has spent decades searching for and analyzing the residues of fermented drinks that can be hundreds or thousands of years old — and then re-creating them.
His latest book, Ancient Brews: Rediscovered and Re-Created, delves into the early history of fermentation. He takes us all the way back to supposedly drunken monkeys feasting on fermented fruit juice or honey they found, long before any human had figured out how to brew beer. And he takes us through his modern re-creations of some of these ancient brews and their cultural importance.
""Just about every culture you can think of, they have a fermented beverage that's central to the social activity, religions, and a lot of times, it becomes economically very important,"" McGovern says. ""And I'm always surprised when I see a book on the Paleolithic, or even just more modern recent history, where they don't really even discuss it.""
McGovern is the scientific director of the Biomolecular Archaeology Project for Cuisine, Fermented Beverages and Health at the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia. He's also an anthropology adjunct professor at the university.
He often travels with the founder and CEO of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, Sam Calagione, with whom he works to re-create ancient beverages and give educational talks about them.
McGovern spoke with NPR recently about his new book. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.
In the book, you mentioned your goal ""to encompass the worldwide millennia-long 'love affair' of our species with fermented beverages."" Do you think you did that? How so?
I just touched on it, really. ... Ninety-nine percent of human history is back in the Paleolithic period, and we have very little evidence from the Paleolithic period. We have no containers to analyze, for instance. So we have to sort of make stabs at what it would have been like 2 million years ago with an early humanoid. The earliest primate on the planet, the Malaysian tree shrew, drank a fermented palm nectar all night long. But we're really in the dark when it comes to the Paleolithic period.
And then also, the chapter on chicha [a beer made primarily from fermented maize] — I thought that was interesting. I've never actually tried it.
That probably is the earliest way humans took carbohydrates like grains, tubers and so forth and did make a fermented beverage. So the first beer was probably made by chewing and spitting it out, and letting microorganisms come along and start the fermentation. We did it with corn. They still do it for manioc in South America.
What would you tell someone who has never tried chicha before and who might be skeptical or might think it's gross to have people chewing up stuff and using it to make beer?
I tell this story about, at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival, people were lined up to taste it, and all across the Denver Convention Center, we had such a long line that the big companies, Budweiser and so forth, they were complaining that we were blocking access to their booths. And it's sanitary, because the alcohol would kill any bad bacteria. But you know, you can put other things with it. The first batch that we made, we put wild strawberries and pepper berries. But you can have it just plain, and it tastes like sort of a lager beer without any additives to it.
Do you have a favorite fermented beverage that you've re-created?
I like the Chinese one, Chateau Jiahu ... the earliest chemically confirmed fermented beverage that we've ever found. But it's a very complex beverage. Already at the beginning of the Neolithic period, we're starting to get the domestication of plants and animals and settling down to take care of everything. It's got rice, some of the earliest rice, in it. We couldn't take ancient rice and use it, but we did use rice that had bran and the hulls intact, and it's because they wouldn't have been able to grind up the grain that purely. It had honey; it had grape, some species of Chinese grape. This would be the earliest wine, the earliest mead and the earliest beer. So that, to me, is really the one that appeals to me most, and it also has a very nice flavor, because it's kind of sweet and sour and goes very well with Chinese food.
What keeps you going after all these years?
Just the prospect of discovering something new, that's what really drives me. We're going to find out something exciting and we're going to re-create another liquid time capsule that's going to transport you back to some period in our ancestry. That's the basic motivation. Because every time you discover something, you get, like, a high. I think it's the best high in the world. You find something archaeologically which no one has ever seen before. It can be dull in a lot of ways, but then you have those moments of insight and discovery that make it all worthwhile. ",0
"(Before It's News)Researchers at the U. S. Army Research Laboratory and the University of Maryland have developed for the first time a lithium-ion battery that uses a water-salt solution as its electrolyte and reaches the 4.0 volt mark desired for household electronics, such as laptop computers, without the fire and explosive risks associated with some commercially available non-aqueous lithium-ion batteries.
Their work appears Sept. 6, 2017, in Joule, Cell Press’s new interdisciplinary energy journal.
This technology will bring the Soldiers a “completely safe and flexible Li-ion battery that provides identical energy density as the SOA Li-ion batteries. The batteries will remain safe – without fire and explosion – even under severe mechanical abuses,” said co-senior author Dr. Kang Xu, ARL fellow who specializes in electrochemistry and materials science.
“In the past, if you wanted high energy, you would choose a non-aqueous lithium-ion battery, but you would have to compromise on safety. If you preferred safety, you could use an aqueous battery such as nickel/metal hydride, but you would have to settle for lower energy,” Xu said. “Now, we are showing that you can simultaneously have access to both high energy and high safety.”
The research follows a 2015 study in Science (doi: 10.1126/science.aab1595) that produced a similar 3.0 volt battery with an aqueous electrolyte but was stymied from achieving higher voltages by the so-called “cathodic challenge,” in which one end of the battery, made from either graphite or lithium metal, is degraded by the aqueous electrolyte. To solve this problem and make the leap from three volts to four, the first author, University of Maryland assistant research scientist Chongyin Yang, designed a new gel polymer electrolyte coating that can be applied to the graphite or lithium anode.
This hydrophobic coating expels water molecules from the vicinity of the electrode surface and then, upon charging for the first time, decomposes and forms a stable interphase–a thin mixture of breakdown products that separates the solid anode from the liquid electrolyte. This interphase, inspired by a layer generated within non-aqueous batteries, protects the anode from debilitating side reactions, allowing the battery to use desirable anode materials, such as graphite or lithium metal, and achieve better energy density and cycling ability.
“The key innovation here is making the right gel that can block water contact with the anode so that the water doesn’t decompose and can also form the right interphase to support high battery performance,” said co-senior author Chunsheng Wang, Professor of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Maryland’s A. James Clark School of Engineering. The addition of the gel coating also boosts the safety advantages of the new battery when compared to standard non-aqueous lithium-ion batteries and boosts the energy density when compared to any other proposed aqueous lithium-ion batteries.
All aqueous lithium-ion batteries benefit from the inflammability of water-based electrolytes as opposed to the highly flammable organic solvents used in their non-aqueous counterparts. Unique to this one, however, is that even when the interphase layer is damaged (if the battery casing were punctured, for instance), it reacts slowly with the lithium or lithiated graphite anode, preventing the smoking, fire, or explosion that could otherwise occur if a damaged battery brought the metal into direct contact with the electrolyte.
Though the power and energy density of the new battery are suitable for commercial applications currently served by more hazardous non-aqueous batteries, certain improvements would make it even more competitive. In particular, the researchers would like to increase the number of full-performance cycles that the battery can complete and to reduce material expenses where possible. “Right now, we are talking about 50-100 cycles, but to compare with organic electrolyte batteries, we want to get to 500 or more,” Wang said.
The researchers also note that the electrochemical manipulations behind the jump to four volts have importance within battery technology and beyond. “This is the first time that we are able to stabilize really reactive anodes like graphite and lithium in aqueous media,” says Xu. “This opens a broad window into many different topics in electrochemistry, including sodium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, multiple ion chemistries involving zinc and magnesium, or even electroplating and electrochemical synthesis; we just have not fully explored them yet.”
Xu said the interphase chemistry needs to be perfected before it can be commercialized. He also said more work needs to be done on scaling up the technology in big cells for testing. With enough funding, the 4-volt chemistry could be ready for commercializing in about five years, he said.

"Are cryptocurrencies an asset class? That depends on you. When you choose an investment portfolio, do you want to start with a category for these new currencies along with stocks, bonds and money market instruments?
This is not related to the question of whether or how much you should invest. You can call cryptocurrencies an asset class and assign zero or even negative portfolio weight to them. Or you can decide they're not an asset class and still try to get positive or negative exposure to them via other asset classes.
There are two main reasons to have asset classes.
The first is that different classes have different uses. Stocks are used primarily for growth, bonds primarily for income and money-market instruments primarily for liquidity. For most investors, it makes sense to set portfolio-level targets for growth, income and liquidity before making individual asset decisions.
Some investors go beyond the big three classes. A popular addition is real assets -- including real estate, commodities and inflation-protected bonds -- to set portfolio-level inflation protection targets. Some investors add credit. But it's equally rational to decide to get real asset exposure via hard-asset stocks and credit exposure in bonds. Calling something an asset class doesn't change how much you invest in it, it changes how you allocate funds and track performance.
Do cryptocurrencies have a different use than traditional financial assets, meaning that investing in them is a portfolio-level decision? The answer is clearly ""yes"" for technophiles who participate in cryptocurrency development and use them for transactions. The answer is clearly ""no"" for people who buy them because the price has gone up recently, in the hopes of selling them when the price rises more;
also for people who are buying them for pure inflation protection.
The rest of us have to decide if cryptocurrencies will support a nontraditional business sector that blurs the lines among investors, employees and customers; or if ideas like distributed ledgers are going to be incorporated into traditional businesses funded by stocks and bonds. Again, the question is not what you think about the likely level of success of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, but whether you think the value, if any, will be captured by traditional companies or holders of cryptoassets. You don't have to know for sure. If you think there is a significant probability that a significant slice of future economic value will be represented by cryptoassets, it makes sense to think about your portfolio-level exposure to that event.
The second reason to have asset classes is that it's hard to compare different types of assets, like a stock with a bond. Once you decide on an allocation to an asset class, you can look over all the assets in that class, and select the best combination for your goals. If the only thing you care about with a cryptocurrency is its price history, then it's in with equities. If you plan to read whitepapers, interview developers, test code and model issuance, then cryptocurrencies need their own category, because that's nothing like stock or bond research.
That leaves a middle group of investors who care about cryptocurrency fundamentals, but plan to delegate the research either to managers in an active fund or to the market in an index fund. Here the choice is how you plan to evaluate investments. If you're going to use traditional metrics such as alpha and Sharpe ratio, then these funds are equities. You use them to the extent they improve the risk-return ratio of your equity allocation.
On the other hand, if you think the manager's job is not to make profits in dollar terms, but to make your cryptocurrency grow in cryptocurrency terms, then they need their own asset class. Is your plan to sell your cryptocurrency fund when you retire, for cash to support your retirement? Or is it to use the cryptocurrency represented by your fund to support your retirement directly?
Don't let know-it-alls tell you that you either have to or can't treat cryptocurrencies as an asset class. That decision has nothing to do with correlations or trading volume, market cap or projected returns, governance or regulation. It's about how you plan for the future. If you view cryptocurrencies as a potential way to increase your traditional wealth, then they belong in traditional asset classes. If you regard them as connections to a new type of wealth, then they need their own class.

"First prepare the moulds for the mousses. Cut a strip of acetate long enough to just cover the inside circumference of a 2in food ring. Using the inside of the food ring as a guide, stick the acetate together in a loop and secure with masking tape.
Create twelve loops and place them on a tray lined with baking paper (the tray needs to fit in your fridge or freezer). These will form the moulds for the mousse cakes.
For the sponge, sieve the flour, sugar, cocoa powder and baking powder into a large bowl. Add the margarine and eggs and mix on high speed for 10 seconds using an electric mixer. Scrape down the sides of the bowl using a spatula and add the milk. Mix on high again for 20 seconds, or until fully combined.
Pour the mixture into the lined Swiss roll tin and smooth the surface. Bake for 15–20 minutes on the middle shelf, until the middle of the sponge springs back when lightly pressed.
When the sponge is cool. Cut out twelve circles of sponge using a 2in food ring as a guide. Press each circle neat-side down into the acetate guides and press to ensure the surface is flat and level. Plug any small gaps with offcuts of sponge, if necessary.
For the mousse, put the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl over a saucepan half filled with gently simmering water (do not allow the water to touch the bowl). Stir with a spatula until almost melted, then remove from the heat and allow to melt completely. Set aside to cool (the chocolate should be as cool as it can be without setting).
Add the whipping cream, double cream, egg whites and peppermint extract to a large bowl. Whisk using an electric mixer until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Add a drop of food coloring to make the cream pale green. Whisk to combine, add a little extra coloring if required.
When the chocolate has cooled as much as possible, but is still liquid, add a spoonful of the cream and quickly fold in to prevent lumps forming. Working quickly, gently fold the chocolate mixture into the cream until fully combined. Gently pour the mixture into a large disposable piping bag with a large hole cut at the tip. Pipe the mint mousse into the moulds to a depth of 1in. Gently shake to level the top, if necessary. Chill in the fridge until the mousse is set (about 2 hours in the fridge or 30 minutes in a freezer).
Add the caster sugar and golden syrup (use a tablespoon that has been sitting in boiling water to easily allow the syrup to slide off) to a deep saucepan over a medium heat (it’s important the saucepan is deep because the honeycomb will bubble up). Heat until the sugar is melted and the mixture has turned an amber caramel color. Remove from the heat and quickly add the bicarbonate of soda. Beat vigorously until the bicarbonate of soda has dissolved and bubbles have started appearing. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and leave to cool for at least 30 minutes.
To assemble, remove the acetate collars carefully. If the mousse is sticking to the collar, return to the fridge or freezer and try again in 10 minutes. Neaten the edges by smoothing with a small offset palette knife if required.",0
"Becoming a good gardener is a challenging prospect, requiring dedication and skill. It should also be borne in mind that different plants need varying levels of attention and conditions for successful growth. For a novice, being able to draw on more experienced knowledge is invaluable. Happily, one gardening blog is promoting an intriguing new method for gardeners old and new that might just be a total game changer. Have you heard the one about the egg and the banana?
With food prices rising in most developed countries, people making the most of their back yards by getting into gardening and producing their own fruit and vegetables is ever more popular. As a matter of fact, according to broadcaster NBC, sales of seeds, rooted plants and fruit trees in the U. S. are all shooting up fast. Evidently, having the shortest possible produce journey from field to fork is all the rage.
Speaking to NBC News, Janet Bedell, of Venice, Florida, spoke of her new-found fondness for growing her own. She said, “Over the past year or two, when my boyfriend and I went shopping and started seeing how little we got out of the grocery store for how much, we figured we might as well give it a shot trying our own veggies and take some of the weight off our pockets.”
And Bedell is by no means alone in bedding vegetables. In a report by The National Gardening Association in 2014, the Texas-based body found more than 42 million U. S. households had come to the same decision. Some are growing their vegetables at home, others are sharing community gardens, but it still adds up to a grow-your-own enthusiast in more than one-third of all American domiciles. And the association has seen a sharp spike in the number of green-fingered wannabes since the worldwide economic crash of 2008.
Mike Metallo, the president and chief executive officer of the National Gardening Association, said, “[It] clearly shows that there truly is a food revolution taking place in America. We are seeing more people, particularly young people, actively engaged in growing their own food.”
Unfortunately for much of the masses, gardening is not as simple and straightforward as planting seeds in the ground and then just waiting. Although enthusiasm and fertilizer can help, not all types of land can produce the same kinds of vegetables. In fact, each vegetable plant derives differing kinds and quantities of nutrients from the soil they grow in.
With this in mind, New Jersey gardener Gary Pilarchik came up with a quirky but ingenious technique for growing tomatoes. Now resident in Maryland, Pilarchik has propagated a healthy presence online. As well as various social media profiles, he writes The Rusted Vegetable Garden blog, and has his own YouTube channel. In May 2013, Pilarchik posted a video using a couple of unusual ingredients in his recipe for growing tomatoes. In the clip, he buried a whole banana and an egg underneath a tomato plant. Subsequently, viewers of his weekly updates were astonished at the results.
The idea is that the banana and egg begin to rot and degrade in the soil underneath the tomato plant’s rootstock. Then the roots reach into the decaying material and are able to convey the rich nutrients from it to the rest of the plant. The nutrient mix from the decomposed banana and egg includes potassium, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and sodium. It gives the tomato plant a huge boost and enables it to grow strong and tall.
Pilarchik took inspiration from Native American tradition for his banana-and-egg trick. In the same fashion, Native Americans would add foreign material when sowing their seeds. Believe it or not , First Nation people would plant fish heads or even whole fish into the ground at the base of their crop. This would fertilize the soil, the same way the soft fruit and ovum did for Pilarchik.
Additionally, Native Americans would also use another green-fingered gimmick when growing their crops they called the Three Sisters. In essence, this would mean planting three different varieties together – corn, squash and beans. As a result, each vegetable crop would offer symbiotic benefits to the other two, ensuring all three thrived.
The beans would provide nitrogen to the soil, enriching the corn and squash so they could grow robustly. The corn provided a trellis on which the beans could climb. The squash provided cover for the other two plants as they were growing, and it helped to deter some pests.
It is not just the old ways that can make a difference, new trends are making an impact as a result of the influx of new gardeners. One of these is called “attentive gardening,” an offshoot of the vogue for mindfulness meditation. Attentive gardening is a way of drawing the grower’s mind away from stress and focusing on the task in hand – in and around the back yard or plot.
Although the banana-and-egg method has been used elsewhere by other gardeners, Pilarchik has a trove of similarly useful ideas on his Youtube channel. For instance, he has a very helpful video on how to use coffee grounds in growing crops. In this case, he uses the grounds to give his plants a lift in much the same way as the banana and egg.
In the video, Pilarchik said, “You can use them in compost piles… You can also mix it into your soil. You can go into [a coffee shop] and get it for free… with labels saying, ‘Grounds for your Garden.’ You can go there practically every day. People don’t tend to take them.”
point that is often overlooked is that it is not man-made fertilizer that causes the most damage, but pesticides. Bugs and insects have the potential to wreck a gardener’s best efforts, but the use of pesticides usually does collateral damage. Consequently, Pilarchik has a great natural tip for those trying to combat winged menaces and creepy crawlies.
Pilarchik suggests using a vegetable product called neem oil to kill pests that destroy crops, because it also allows the garden’s flora and fauna to thrive. The oil is derived from the fruits and seeds of the subtropical, evergreen neem tree. In another of his videos, Pilarchik advised, “You have to be aware of what you’re buying when you buy neem oil. You want 100-per cent cold-pressed neem oil.”
Pilarchik went on to say, “You want to spray the neem oil on your plants [as part of your gardening] routine. It’s going to vary place to place, but every seven to 14 days, keep your green leafy plants… sprayed and that will stop the damage from the [pests].”
Ultimately, there are other obstacles to those looking to get into gardening than just lack of know-how. Although there has been an uptick in the numbers of people getting their hands dirty, there is a sizable group who simply can’t afford to jump on the grow-your-own bandwagon. Members of the “Generation Rent” demographic tend not to own their homes and research by the Horticultural Trades Association in the U. K. shows they have little interest in rented plots. So those people lucky enough to have nothing to stop them should really get growing.",1
"An immigrant. He started Intel. We need more like him.
President Donald Trump just endorsed a plan to change the way the U. S. immigration system operates. Half of the plan is very good. The other half is bad and counterproductive.
The plan, known as the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act, was developed by Republican senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia. It would do two things. First, it would introduce a merit-based system that would admit immigrants according to their education level, language skills and professional qualifications, similar to what Canada and Australia use. Second, it would cut the total amount of legal immigration in half, reducing immigration based on family reunification to immediate family members only, and ending the lottery system for green-card permanent residence permits.
The first half of this plan -- the merit-based system -- is a very good idea. I’ve long advocated for exactly this shift in the way the U. S. screens immigrants.
High-skilled immigration is important for several reasons. First, although low-skilled immigrants -- manual laborers, blue-collar workers and the like -- create a small but noticeable amount of wage and job competition for native-born Americans, skilled immigrants do the opposite. According to a recent National Academy of Sciences report, which took input from both immigration boosters and detractors, skilled immigrants actually raise the wages of their high-skilled U. S. peers. This probably happens because knowledge industries rely crucially on new ideas -- the more smart people we have creating new ideas, the more other smart people can take those ideas and use them for other applications.
Also, the NAS report found that although low-skilled immigrants don’t have much of an impact on government finances, high-skilled immigrants create a strong positive fiscal boost. The aging U. S. population needs high-earning young people to pay for old people’s pensions and retirements, to fund the public services they depend on, and to buy their houses and stocks. Skilled immigrants are the way to pay for native-born Americans to have a comfortable retirement.
Finally, skilled immigrants are a bit quicker to integrate into American culture. That means they will enjoy rapid mobility, and won’t become a permanent outsider class.
So high-skilled immigrants are pure gravy for a country like the U. S. Canada has been enjoying great success with its points-based immigration program -- the RAISE Act would, in this way, represent the adoption of best practice from the U.S.'s neighbor to the north.
But the RAISE Act also has a dark side -- the deep cuts to the total number of legal immigrants allowed into the country every year. This will partially defeat the purpose of the points-based system the act would create. It makes no sense to shift to a skills-based immigration system, but then limit the number of skilled workers who are allowed in.
Fewer immigrants means less support for the aging native-born U. S. population. It means a greater strain on Social Security and Medicare. It means pensions for city workers and police and firefighters going bankrupt. And it means stagnation of housing prices, because of reduced demand from young high-earning workers. In other words, slashing immigration would hurt the very native-born people that Trump’s immigration advisers, like Stephen Miller, claim to want to protect.
Miller, and the RAISE Act’s sponsors, probably believe that slashing legal immigration will mostly keep out low-skilled laborers. But they’re wrong. They’ve missed the big shift in U. S. immigration patterns that has happened over the past decade. Low-education workers have almost completely stopped coming into the country, so that more and more of the immigration the U.S. now gets consists of people with degrees:
This means that slashing overall immigration numbers will simply reduce the total number of high-skilled immigrants coming to boost the U. S. economy. It’s counterproductive and pointless to increase the percentage of skilled immigrants while reducing the overall number.
This ill-advised move is probably to assuage the anxieties of those Americans who believe that immigrants are displacing them and destroying their native culture. Trump advisershave expressed this fear in the past. But overall, Americans are becoming more positive and welcoming in their attitude toward immigrants. Most of the country doesn’t share Miller’s trepidation:
So the RAISE Act is half-wise reasonable policy, half-counterproductive fear-based mistake. The plan should be changed by simply dropping the second part and keeping the first. Prudent Republicans, such as Jeb Bush, have suggested doing exactly that. The U. S. would benefit greatly from a shift to skills-based immigration, but the overall number of people coming in shouldn’t be reduced.

"There is a good reason that Kellogg’s spent over $1,012,552 on media propaganda in California & Washington to defeat voter ballot initiatives that would have required the labeling of GMO foods, and now are contributing again to the defeat of labeling initiatives in Oregon (contributing $250,000).
A consumer recently sent a box of Froot Loops to a lab for genetic testing and found that the corn and soy used in the cereal are 100% RoundUp Ready GMO. So is the sugar. Never mind the other toxic ingredients in the cereal. This means that in one box of Kellogg’s cereal (and likely all their cereals contain similar GMO products), you are dining on a double dose of glyphosate and Bt toxins – glyphosate being patented as an ‘antibiotic’ by Monsanto in 2011.
Kellogg’s has been making cereal since 1898, but I seriously doubt its founders ever thought it would be poisoning the world at breakfast every morning.
Not only is the corn in Froot Loops sprayed with RoundUp, but it is a pesticide in its own right, registered with and regulated by the EPA. But it isn’t just Froot Loops that is of concern, for all of you who avoid sugar-laden cereals. The ‘healthful’ Kellogg’s brands are full of the stuff, too.
Kellogg’s claims that, even though they don’t use genetically engineered ingredients in Europe, in the U. S., “consumer concerns about the usage of biotech ingredients in food production are low.”
Kashi, Bare Naked, Morningstar Farms, and Gardenburger – all brands you probably have been relying on as healthful foods to feed your family – are also contaminated.
Kellogg’s has promised to change the labeling on their Kashi brands – but they also promised that their products had hardly any GMOs in them in the first place!
Read: Kellogg’s Foods are Full of GMO Sugar Beets – Join the Boycott!
Kellogg’s is feeding children pesticides & antibiotics, without their parents’ knowledge or consent. Are you going to tolerate that?
You can bet that the ‘vigorous testing of their products is a lie, too. They told us that all these brands were verified as non-GMO.

The truth? Kashi lied. Cornucopia Institute tested Kashi’s GoLean cereal and found it to contain 100% genetically engineered soy. The company’s response? Just get used to GMO contamination!
In response to the question, “Do you use GMO ingredients?”
Kashi said, “factors such as pollen drift from nearby crops and current practices in agricultural storage, handling, and shipping, has led to an environment in North America where GMOs are not sufficiently segregated. As a result, some of our foods include ingredients made from genetically engineered crops.”
You can boycott them, petition them, or call them at 1 (800) 962-1413, but I suggest you make it very clear that you won’t be eating their poison products any longer. Enough is enough!",1
"Earn millions or billions and you can be just like J. B. Pritzker! You too can tell everyone to use the WRONG bathroom as a protest to President Trump.
This insanely rich dork doesn’t seem to grasp the concept of what Trump did with the whole #TransRights nonsense. Trump put the trans problem on the shoulders of local small government. Let the states and cities decide what to do. He actually pulled big government OUT of something. Mostly, because it’s lousy and affects a very tiny percentage of people. Well, actually, it affects everyone, because most people don’t want to see a tall farting man in the women’s loo. And no offense, but I don’t want to see these ugly women trying to be guys standing next to me trying to aim their vagina at a urinal. If I have to see a woman pee, then I prefer her to be very lady like.
Pritzker then kinda backtracked and said he didn’t mean it literally. He doesn’t really want you to use the wrong bathroom. If you’re reading this from the wrong toilet in Target, then kindly wipe and exit. You are not supposed to be there.
Well too late. I bet someone, somewhere, saw that Tweet and didn’t see your second. Now they’re out in the world telling everyone to use the wrong bathroom. Hopefully, no one is stupid enough to listen, but we all know the world is filled with highs and lows – smarts and not so smarts. Not everyone stays on Twitter all day, so there could be a bunch of liberal men running around in the wrong bathroom this weekend. Creeps!
As a protest against Trump's rescinding protections for trans kids, everyone should use the other gender's bathroom today! #protecttranskids
A billionaire Democratic megadonor, who is exploring a run for governor, encouraged men to use women’s bathrooms on Wednesday sparking criticism from transgender advocates and politicians.
J. B. Pritzker, the billionaire heir whose father co-founded Hyatt hotels, floated the idea of switching bathrooms in the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order reversing an Obama policy that could have stripped federal funds from schools that maintain separate bathroom facilities based on sex.
“As a protest against Trump’s rescinding protections for trans kids, everyone should use the other gender’s bathroom today!” he tweeted at 8:36 a.m.
Most women don’t want men in the ladies room. Most guys don’t want girls (ugly ones) in the men’s room. Why can’t we just leave it like that?
If you have a penis, then you’re male. If you have a vagina, then you’re female. It’s basic biology.
Just because a man wears a dress, that doesn’t mean he’s a woman. Not one bit. Why? Because he’s not. If a woman wears overalls, workboots, and pees standing up – is she a man? No. She’s not. She can’t even aim when she pees, so she’s not even close to being a man.
Let’s not forget the amount of crime that can happen to young girls when grown men perverts take advantage of transgenderism. What if a pervert says “oh, I’m a tranny” and walks in the ladies room with his cell phone camera and snaps pictures of young girls? What if he rapes or assaults someone? Oh, that’s right! It’s already happened plenty of times. It’s not the transgender people who commit the crimes, but it’s the people pretending to be trans, so let’s not OPEN THE DOOR FOR THEM!
Transgender people make up a whole 1-3% of the American population. Transgender people are also fake self hating humanoids who live a deranged life of mental illness. No wonder there’s a high suicide rate. If I wanted to be a woman, then realized I look bad in heels, I might off myself too.
Trans people live a life of lies and that’s misleading to the people around them.
What if you’re a guy, and you take a girl home for the night and she pulls out a huge penis?
The transgender should be charged with attempted rape.
Let’s be honest – transgender people are messed up. They either hate themselves in real life, then the potentially hate their new self, and it seems like they’re suffering from a wildly distorted mental illness that forbids them from loving themselves HOW THEY WERE BORN.
There is nothing wrong with being born a male or female. Whatever you’re born with – embrace it! Love it. Be kind to it.
No matter what you dress up as, or what surgery you get – you will not ever be the opposite sex. It doesn’t matter what you dress up as. Men are men, women are women.
Get a gender reassignment surgery and then you can go in the other bathroom.
Until then, please use the bathroom that’s determined by your biological birth genitalia.",1

ONE DAY I DECIDED TO QUIT
I quit my job, my relationship, my spirituality… I wanted to quit my life.
I went to the woods to have one last talk with God.
“God”, I asked,
“Can you give me one good reason not to quit?”.
His answer surprised me…
“Look around”, He said. “Do you see the fern and the bamboo ?
“Yes”, I replied.
“When I planted the fern and the bamboo seeds, I took very good care of them.
I gave them light.I gave them water.The fern quickly grew from the earth.
Its brilliant green covered the floor.Yet nothing came from the bamboo seed. But I did not quit on the bamboo.In the second year the Fern grew more vibrant and plentiful. And again, nothing came from the bamboo seed. But I did not quit on the bamboo. He said.
“In year three there was still nothing from the bamboo seed.But I would not quit. In year four, again, there was nothing from the bamboo seed. I would not quit.” He said.
“Then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth. Compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant…But just 6 months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall.
It had spent the five years growing roots. Those roots made it strong and gave it what it needed to survive.I would not give any of my creations a challenge it could not handle.”
He asked me. “Did you know, my child, that all this time you have been struggling, you have actually been growing roots”.
“I would not quit on the bamboo.I will never quit on you.” “Don’t compare yourself to others.” He said.”The bamboo had a different Purpose than the fern. Yet they both make the forest beautiful.””Your time will come”, God said to me. “You will rise high”.
“How high should I rise?” I asked. “How high will the bamboo rise?” He asked in return. “As high as it can?” I questioned.”Yes.” He said, “Give Me glory by rising as high as you can.” I left the forest and brought back this story.I hope these words can help you see that God will never give up on you.Never, Never, Never, Give up.
Don’t tell the Lord how big the problem is, tell the problem how Great the Lord is!

"This report is a PAID ADVERTISEMENT from Oilprice.com
A new technology is here that has the potential to reshape lithium production like fracking reshaped oil.
The global battery market is set to hit $120 billion in less than two years, and there’s a massive investor opportunity here in lithium—but this isn’t a mining play, it’s a tech play all the way.
As lithium continues to enjoy status as the hottest metal on the market, and as producers race to the finish line to bring new supply online, one little-known company just might hold technology that will give it a big edge.
In the swarm of new entrants on the lithium playing field, International Battery Metals (CSE:IBAT; OTC: RHHNF) stands out—front and center—because it’s sitting on a proprietary advanced technology that could push lithium into the production stage rapidly. It has signed an LOI with North American Lithium (NAL) to acquire all its lithium extraction process intellectual property and be restructured with NAL becoming an integral part of the company.
Where traditional solar evaporation technology takes up to 24 months to extract lithium from the brine, IBAT incoming CEO Burba says he can do it in 24 hours. That would put IBAT on the front line of new lithium coming online to meet the battery demand. And that demand is supplying our energy transition for everything from mainstreamed electric vehicles (EVs) to massive energy storage solutions and consumer electronics market that grows leaps and bounds.
The lithium game isn’t about exploration, it’s about innovation—and IBAT’s proprietary technology to be acquired from NAL was invented by the same game-changing inventor that came up with a similar tech for FMC Corp. (NYSE:FMC), one of the world’s four top lithium producers.
Lithium is currently produced through a grueling 24-month solar evaporation process that entails slowly extracting all other elements from the brine until only lithium remains.
IBAT’s technology is designed to remove evaporation ponds from the equation. As inventor-CEO John Burba puts it: “Our tech has such a high specificity for lithium that it can directly take the lithium out.”
With its eye on the lithium prize, IBAT is going for fast production and commercial scalability, at a time when lithium prices per metric ton are fantastic:
Disruptive technology changes everything, and if the deal with NAL completes and IBAT’s tech breaks through successfully, it could potentially do for lithium what fracking did to unlock shale for the U. S. oil and gas industry.
Here are 5 reasons to keep a close eye on International Battery Metals (CSE:IBAT; OTC: RHHNF)
The technology IBAT has an LOI to acquire, and on acquisition is considering for licensing to third party lithium producers could be a significant key to unlocking $84 billion in lithium brine resources—by making it faster and cheaper to produce.
Production capacity is now at a critical juncture. It takes a minimum of 4 years for an average Lithium brine mine to come online–and another 3-4 years to reach full capacity.
The ambitious targets for EV deployment and energy storage applications require massive Lithium mining capacity to be built much sooner than current technologies allow.
That’s the chief reason why companies are aggressively pursuing new resources such as oil field brines, jadarite and hectorite clay. Lithium brine deposits are estimated to contain 66 percent of the world’s 14 million metric tonnes (MT) of Lithium. That’s Lithium worth $84 billion at current prices.
Unfortunately, recovery of Lithium from brine deposits is a painfully slow process. Traditional solar evaporation technology is an extremely time-intensive process, with a lengthy production cycle that can exceed 18 months.
Oilfield brines solve some of these problems due to their high Lithium concentrations. But, there’s a kicker here as well– oil field brines contain very high concentrations of dissolved ions (>100,000 mg/L), making commercial recovery of Lithium exceedingly expensive.
The technology IBAT is acquiring from NAL is based on a process that has been extracting lithium continuously in Argentina for almost 20 years.
Instead of going the traditional route of trying to isolate Lithium by removing all of those complex ions, the IBAT tech removes the Lithium directly.
According to IBAT CEO John Burba, the mastermind of this technology, the process takes the lithium out on a continuous basis. As the brine goes by, it collects lithium and lets the other impurities continue on and go straight back into the ground. The end-product is a diluted stream of lithium chloride and water that comes out as the brine goes by. That original solution has few impurities which are easily removed through an evaporation process.
The whole extraction process takes–24 hours, period—so it would mean the end of 18-24-month residencies.
If proved up for licensing, this technology could be highly disruptive, offering the fastest-to-production Lithium brine extraction solution out there. Faster means more efficient and cost effective.
While all the new entrants are struggling with costs, IBAT’s technology could put it on cost par with the Big 3 lithium producers—the lowest-cost producers right now. That includes Albemarle Corp. (NYSE:ALB), Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) and FMC.
Inventor John Burba—a veteran in lithium extraction—is the incoming IBAT (CSE:IBAT; OTC: RHHNF) Chairman and CEO, and he’s one of the most important pioneers in extraction technologies. He is considered a genius in this space.
IBAT’s new to-be-acquired technology is actually based on a tech that John Burba co-invented and sold in the 1990s when he was a leading technology figure at giant FMC.
Before Burba came along, everyone thought that lithium could be produced from only a limited number of brines.
That’s where Burba’s genius came into play … FMC has been using that same tech for nearly 20 years, and it’s responsible for making the purest primary lithium carbonate in the world. It’s even earned its own lithium label: “FMC-grade” carbonate.
Burba, who became the CEO of lithium extraction company Simbol Materials in 2013, has made dramatic advancements upon the old technology he co-developed for FMC.
Burba will work with Robert Miller on fund raising efforts. Miller has raised over $500 million in early-stage capital and taken 7 companies public, including NASDAQ and AMEX. He’s also founder of one of the largest gold-mining companies, Crystallex.
This inventor/CEO has already revolutionized lithium processing once. Now he’s determined to do it again, this time leading a company and a tag team that packs a professional punch.
Entering the lithium business just this year, IBAT (CSE:IBAT; OTC: RHHNF) has hit the ground running and they have reason to be confident in the commercial viability of their to-be-acquired advanced technology. Who wouldn’t be with the genius in this space who helped design FMC’s super-efficient lithium extraction process.
Oilfield brines are a potentially staggering resource. But it’s a resource that can be best accessed when the tech is proved up and licensed. So, again, this is like a potential shale revolution—but for lithium.
Lithium has been found extensively in North American oilfield brines, and IBAT has evaluated three so far, already securing the first. IBAT plans to set up a pilot extraction facility in early 2018, and then secure additional licenses for other high-grade lithium brines by March.
In late July, IBAT signed an option agreement to purchase 37,500 acres in the Woodbury Carper Lithium Resource Project in Illinois. This is a shallow-drilling lithium resource development opportunity in the U. S. heartland, and it’s on easy-to-permit and easy-to-drill land. It’s already got several existing wells capable of producing large volumes of lithium-rich brine, and a salt-water disposal well to get rid of brines after extraction.
Oil and gas exploration here has already discovered lithium inadvertently, so this is a great place for IBAT to launch.
By 2020, it anticipates becoming a supplier of various battery metals. And by then, well, demand will be out of this world.
IBAT (CSE:IBAT; OTC: RHHNF) is not setting itself up to be a one-hit metals-wonder: It’s eyeing lithium and tin and coltan.
Tin is one of the best strategic industrial metals, and as early as January 2018, IBAT plans to pay a licensing fee of $3 million to Thompson Resources to secure 3 tin properties.
Strong demand for the non-ferrous metal especially in the food and beverage packaging industries as well.
IBAT also intends to target coltan (tantalum), working with third-parties to identify and acquire high-value properties around the world.
With global battery demand forecast to rise 7.7 percent to $120 billion already in 2019, and with the lithium market alone set to reach $1.7 billion, this is a market that won’t wait for evaporating ponds.
The global Li-ion market is expected to exceed $46 billion by 2022, growing at nearly 11 percent CAGR. What the world needs right now is plentiful supply of high-grade Lithium to power the unfolding EV revolution.
There’s more upside risk here because of battery demand than there is downside risk, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Andrew Grant.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) 70kWh Model S battery pack contains 63Kg of lithium, equivalent to the amount of lithium in 10,000 cellphones, and the EV posterchild has already accumulated more than 400K Model 3 pre-orders on its books.
Tesla, too, will use up the entire world’s current supply of battery-grade lithium when it hits a production clip of 500K Model 3s in its giant Nevada Gigafactory sometime in 2018. When it opens up four more gigafactories, well …
Meanwhile, the plug-in EV market is already growing at 10x faster than its gasoline-powered counterpart. Bloomberg Finance has forecast there will be more than 100 million EVs on our roads by 2040.
The Bottom Line? This is Burba’s Brine
This is an improved technology that we’ve already seen put to work in an older, less advanced version, for giant FMC—which is today one of the world’s four major producers who have monopolized lithium.
With the same inventor behind the advanced version of this technology to take over at the helm of IBAT, confidence runs high that we’ll see a positive evaluation process for licensing.
Before the explosive entrance of the lithium-ion battery, getting lithium out of the brine wasn’t so urgent. Now, as EVs become mainstream, all the talk is of massive energy storage solutions and consumer electronics sees no end to demand in site—the brine is the new battlefield. And IBAT (CSE:IBAT; OTC: RHHNF) is poised to deliver the most decisive weapon.

"OK Food, Inc., an Oklahoma City, Okla. establishment, is recalling approximately 933,272 pounds of breaded chicken products that may be contaminated with extraneous materials, specifically metal, the U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
The ready-to-eat (RTE) breaded chicken items were produced on various dates from Dec. 19, 2016, through March 7, 2017. A list of the products subject to recall can be found here PDF| View Labels.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-7092” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations and institutions nationwide.
The problem was discovered on March 21, 2017, after OK Foods Inc. received five consumer complaints stating that metal objects were found in the ready-to-eat chicken products and by FSIS inspection personnel during verification activities. After an internal investigation, the firm identified the affected product and determined that the objects in all the complaints came from metal conveyor belting.
The USDA Class 1 recall designates a product high-risk if there is a reasonable probability that the product’s use will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death.
There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
Affected chicken was sold under the Chickentopia, Spring River Farms, TenderBird, Save A Lot, Great Value, Double D Foods, Lake Liner Logo, and Smart Foods 4 Schools labels.
7.5-pound packages containing “Great Value Fully Cooked Herb Seasoned Breaded Chicken Breast Patty With Rib Meat” bearing case code 201258 and “Best By/Use by” dates 3/2/2018.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.",1

"Two Equifax executives will retire following massive data breach            Be the first to know about new  stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.    You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.
A monitor displays Equifax Inc. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg News)  Aweek after Equifax disclosed it suffered a massive data breach that may have compromised sensitive information belonging to 143 million people, the credit reporting agency's chief information officer, David Webb, and chief security officer, Susan Mauldin, are retiring, effective immediately, the company said in a statement Friday evening. The sudden departures come as Equifax has been the target of intense criticism over the lapses in security that led to the hack and the way the company has handled the aftermath. Richard F. Smith, Equifax's chief executive,apologized for the breach in an op-ed published by USA Today earlier this week. “This is the most humbling moment in our 118-year history,” he said. But his promises to make changes at the company were not enough for many alarmed lawmakers on Capitol Hill. At least two congressional hearings on the Equifax breach have been announced. The first scheduled panel will take place on Oct. 3, when Smith is expected to testify. A bipartisan group of 36 senators have asked the Justice Department and the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate reports Equifax executives sold stock after learning about the breach but before it was made public. The Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step ofannouncing it is conducting a probeinto the Equifax breach. A major frustration for consumers who've sought to protect themselves from the Equifax data breach has been having to pay for freezing and unfreezing their credit, as a precaution against fraud. On Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and a dozen other Democrats introduced a bill that would ban credit reporting bureaussuch asEquifax, Experian and TransUnion from charging consumers for the service. Equifax said in its statement the company would offer free security freezes through Nov. 21. But that is unlikely to satisfy the demands of some elected officials. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Thursday the company's chief executive and board of directors should step down unless they take five steps to correct their mishandling: notify affected consumers; provide free credit monitoring to them for at least 10 years, offer to freeze their credit for up to 10 years; remove forced arbitration clauses from their terms of use; and comply with fines or new standards that come out of investigations. “It’s only right that the CEO and board step down if they can’t reach this modicum of corporate decency by next week,” he said.    The Post's Brian Fung called Equifax to see if his data was compromised in the recent hack. Here are his calls. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)

"This fall, as I have for nearly 29 years as an educator and academic advisor, I’ll face freshmen engineering students who are certain of what they’re going to do with the rest of their lives.
Then they take a few classes, join some clubs, look around – and some will realize this is not what they expected and may not be what they want. They’re at a loss. Suddenly, all their preparation to follow a single, narrow path has done them more harm than good.
Today’s high school students are expected to decide on a life path early, and dedicate everything to pursuing that track. This is especially true for teens considering a STEM field, such as engineering or science, as they often use their high school experience to take all the STEM courses that will prepare them for college. While it can produce students with high technical capabilities, this hyper focus can have serious drawbacks.
We do this to them – we educators, we parents. We want what is best for them and for them to succeed, so when they show an affinity for a certain subject, we’re quick to jump in and encourage them to pursue it.
But we fail to realize that we likely force the decision-making process too soon, which puts unnecessary pressure on them. Even worse, we send the message that the best way to succeed in life is to stick to a single path, rather than allowing yourself to grow and change in the face of new experiences.
As a result students feel crunched. They’re trying to adjust to college and their parents’ expectations. It’s hard to make expansive change when they’ve been taught – at school and home – to be so rigid.
So how do we help?
We can help by encouraging students to use high school to build a breadth of knowledge in many different areas, knowing that college will be the time to build depth. By encouraging a variety of academic subjects in high school – even if the goal is pursuing a science, engineering or other highly technical path. Doing so will produce students who are better thinkers and have a more well-rounded education.
Think about this as a more liberal arts approach, in which a student understands and can apply elements from many, non-science fields to his or her work. For example, concepts of shapes, balance, structure and flow found in architecture or art may have counterparts in, say, chemistry or materials sciences.
Consider engineering: Though engineering integrates computer science and mathematics, it also requires a great deal of creative thinking about the non-science world, problem solving and an understanding of connections between and among different disciplines and situations. Engineering is, in essence, a discipline of creating, building and making – one that can lead to myriad (often surprising) career opportunities. The more a student knows — and continues to learn – about more subjects, the better an engineer he or she will be. (See: Leonardo da Vinci.)
Perhaps most important, a more expansive experience produces young people better equipped to deal with the uncertainty they will face in college, careers – and life.
So every time a freshman enters my office, very concerned, and says he is “undecided” or she doesn’t yet know what she wants to do, I want to applaud. Because that’s what the university experience is all about—helping students find their own unique paths to the future.
But this can only work if the student – and parents – are open-minded enough to be patient and entertain many possibilities.
If we give students a broad-based high school foundation before entering college, I believe we can create a generation of passionate, engaged engineers and scientists, who are just as well-versed in communication and issues of social change as they are with technical formulas and computational modeling techniques.",0
"They say that love is stronger than death, and Leonard and Hazel Cherry are proof that this is true.
The high school sweethearts married in 1942 and built a happy life together. The love they shared was an inspiration to everyone who knew them, especially their son, David.
“They never really spent a day apart unless it was for a family emergency or something,” he said. “And I never heard a cross word between them. I never heard them raise their voices to each other unless they were calling across the yard. They didn’t fight!”
Leonard was a bomber pilot and trainer during World War II. He worked on numerous bases throughout the war while Hazel waited for him at home.
Soon after David was born in 1944, the couple moved to Fort Worth, Texas and started an auto repair shop called Cherry Hill, which they ran until 1980 when they moved to Waco to be closer to David and his family.
They absolutely adored their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and the kids adored them right back.
“They had such a special relationship, they were so close and came to all of their school events,” David recalled. “When my son was growing up, dad came to all of his basketball games.”
In addition to coming to all of the games, Leonard showed up to almost all of the practices, too. He made sure his grandkids knew he loved and supported them.
When Leonard began to show signs of dementia, he and Hazel moved into an assisted living facility. Hazel stayed in the independent living section while Leonard was under nursing care, but that didn’t keep them apart – every day Hazel would make her way to his room and stay by his side as long as she could.
Hazel had always been in good health, but when she was 93 she suddenly began to get very tired and weak. She was taken to the emergency room, but died just a week after she had begun showing signs of sickness.
“My daughter was talking to her when she blinked, smiled and let go,” David recalled.
Leonard had not been informed of his wife’s death yet, but his caretaker said that somehow he just knew. He was fidgety and restless all morning and then, just 10 minutes after she passed, he breathed a deep exhale and calmed down.
“I’m not sure how it worked, but he knew what happened,” David said. “He had a connection… He could feel it.”
Less than nine hours after Hazel died, Leonard took his last breath and passed away at the age of 95.
For a couple who had spent every minute possible together their entire lives, it was the perfect way to go.
“It’s what God wanted,” David said. “And I think it’s what they wanted too.”
“They had so much love for each other,” he added. “No question, they are both up above, smiling… They’ll always be together.”
While their family will miss them greatly, they know Leonard and Hazel are smiling down on them from above – together, just like always.
Were you touched by Leonard and Hazel’s sweet love story? So share this!",1
"Anyone who’s ever been given one of their friend’s Adderall knows the powerfuleffects brought on by this tiny unintimidating pink pill. Increased energy, enhanced ability to focus and concentrate, and a euphoric sense of being are the most common effects of this drug.
Coincidentally, increased energy, enhanced ability to focus and concentrate, and a euphoric sense of being — are also the most common effects of crystal meth.
So, why are these effects so similar? Because the drugs are nearly identical in their chemical structure.
Dr.Carl Hart is a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Columbia University. Hart is known for his research into drug abuse and drug addiction. Hart was also the first tenured African American professor of sciences at Columbia University. Hereceived a bachelor of science and a master of science from the University of Maryland and he received his Ph. D. in neuroscience from the University of Wyoming. By all accounts, he is the expert in the field of drug use.
In a recent article on his website theinfluence.org, Hart explains that the only major difference between crystal meth and Adderall is public perception.
Hart explains that this perception of illicit meth is largely due to misinformation put out by public service messages.
“Perhaps it has something to do with public “educational” campaigns aimed at discouraging methamphetamine use. These campaigns usually show, in graphically horrifying detail, some poor young person who uses the drug for the first time and then ends up engaging in uncharacteristic acts such as prostitution, stealing from parents, or assaulting strangers for money to buy the drug. At the end of advertisement, emblazoned on the screen, is: “Meth—not even once.” We’ve also seen those infamous “meth mouth” images (extreme tooth decay), wrongly presented as a direct consequence of methamphetamine use.
These types of media campaigns neither prevent nor decrease the use of the drug; nor do they provide any real facts about the effects of meth. They succeed only in perpetuating false assumptions.
Swayed by this messaging, the public remains almost entirely ignorant of the fact that methamphetamine produces nearly identical effects to those produced by the popular ADHD medication d-amphetamine (dextroamphetamine). You probably know it as Adderall: a combination of amphetamine and d-amphetamine mixed salts.”
Hart admitted that he too believed thatmethamphetamine was far more dangerous than d-amphetamine, despite the fact that the chemical structure of the two drugs is nearly identical. However, after thoroughly researching the evidence, Hart shattered this belief.
To back up his claims, Hart and his team conducted a study of 13 men who regularly use methamphetamine. During the double-blind study, the men were given a hit ofmethamphetamine, of d-amphetamine, or of placebo.
According to the study:
Like d-amphetamine, methamphetamine increased our subjects’ energy and enhanced their ability to focus and concentrate; it also reduced subjective feelings of tiredness and the cognitive disruptions typically brought about by fatigue and/or sleep deprivation. Bothdrugs increased blood pressure and the rate at which the heart beat. No doubt these arethe effects that justify the continued use of d-amphetamine by several nations’ militaries,including our own.
And when offered an opportunity to choose either the drugs or varying amounts of money, our subjects chose to take d-amphetamine on a similar number of occasions as they chose to take methamphetamine. These regular methamphetamine users could not distinguish between the two. (It is possible that the methyl group enhances methamphetamine’s lipid-solubility, but this effect appears to be imperceptible to human consumers.)
It is also true that the effects of smoking methamphetamine are more intense than those of swallowing a pill containing d-amphetamine. But that increased intensity is due to the route of administration, not the drug itself. Smoking d-amphetamine produces nearly identical intense effects as smoking methamphetamine. The same would be true if the drugs were snorted intranasally.
The significance of Hart’s study has a paradigm-shattering effect. On one hand, it shows that a drug, which is legally taken by millions of children in the US, is identical to an illegal substance associated with a slew of negative traits. On the other hand, it shows that meth users are not much different from the millions of Americans who take its legal form.
The use of methamphetamine in the United States is actually on the decline according to U. S. National Drug Control Policy Director R. Gil Kerlikowske. However, there are over 3.5 million American children currently take an ADHD drug, a nearly 500% increase since 1990.
It seems that the pharmaceutical industryhas figured out a way to market ADHD to the masses in an attempt to sell them their legal version of meth.
As Dr. Hart so eloquently says,
“It took me nearly 20 years and dozens of scientific publications in the area of drug use to recognize my own biases around methamphetamine. I can only hope that you don’t require as much time and scientific activity in order to understand that the Adderall that you or your loved one takes each day is essentially the same drug as meth.
And I hope that this knowledge engenders less judgment of people who use meth, and greater empathy.”",1
"FRANKFURT, Germany — A group of major automakers plans to open hundreds of fast-charging stations for electric cars in Europe in coming years and use a common plug technology in what they hope will be a big step toward mass acceptance of battery-powered vehicles.
BMW, Daimler, Ford and the Volkswagen Group with its Audi and Porsche brands have equal shares in the venture, Ionity, plans for which were first announced last year.
They said Friday that they will open the first of 20 stations this year in Germany, Austria and Norway at 75-mileintervals along major roads. They plan to expand the network to more than 100 stations next year and have about 400 in place across Europe by 2020.
The founding companies said ""other automotive manufacturers are invited to help expand the network.""

More: Analysis: Tesla looks to dominate China’s EV market
The aim is to make it easier for electric cars to travel long distances and render them more appealing to the mass market. Hours-long charging times have meant battery-powered cars are limited to use for short commutes and local shopping trips. Owners typically recharge overnight at home or in an employer's parking lot during the day. That has left battery cars as a second vehicle in some first-adopter households, with a conventional car kept for longer journeys. The chance to charge up fast far from home would make it possible to take an electric vehicle on a family vacation.
A typical electric car can take several hours to charge from empty using a 7 kilowatt-hour home plug. The Ionity network stations by contrast will have charging capacity of up to 350 kilowatts per hour. That's aimed at the future because currently available car cannot charge at that speed. A BMW i3 electric would take 30 minutes to fast-charge at its maximum of 50 kilowatts per hour; at 350 kilowatts per hour, in theory the time could be cut to under 10 minutes. The hope is, drivers could charge in the time it takes to have a cup of coffee at the recharging station.
The new network will also use a standardized plug — the CCS, or Combined Charging System standard — that isn't tied to any one car maker.
The new network will set up the stations in partnership with operators of rest areas and gas stations in the three countries.
A pan-European fast-charging network ""plays an essential role in establishing a market for electric vehicles,"" Ionity CEO Michael Hajesch said in a statement.
Uptake of electric cars across Europe has been patchy so far. Electrically chargeable vehicles were only 1.2% of European car sales in the second quarter, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Norway, where the government has aggressively pushed for low-emissions vehicles, is an exception with 29% market share for electrically chargeable vehicles. By contrast, Greece registered only 32 rechargeable cars last year.
The higher cost of the vehicles is a key reason, on top of limited range and lack of places to charge up, and for now government subsidies and tax breaks are important to supporting sales. Analysts say that electric vehicles may become more affordable as battery costs fall.
Automakers are sinking billions into developing electric cars in part as a response to ever-tougher limits on air pollution and carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas blamed for global warming.
The new company will be headquartered in Munich, Germany, and have 50 employees by the start of 2018.",0
"According to recent studies if your kid is healthy, then you don’t need to worry about the fever because it is the mechanism that fights against infection that causes the illness. You can make few things in order to reduce the fever of your kid. In case the fever lasts longer than several days, then you must take your child to the doctor.
Here are some tips how to reduce your kid’s fever within 5 minutes:
Brandy water – use one cup of brandy and dilute it with water. Soak gauze in this combination and place it in your kid’s socks.
Remove layers of clothing – your kid will be able to reduce the heat through the skin. It should wear light layers of cloth. If the kid shivers you should use some light blanket to cover it.
Use a lukewarm bath or sponge bath. While water evaporates through the skin your kid will lose heat. Cold water is not advisable because it could cause the kid to shiver and increase the body temperature.
The kid should drink plenty of fluids and eat chilled foods like ice pops and yogurt that will refresh the body from the inside and maintain the organism hydrated
The kid should stay inside in a cool place
Grated potatoes – peel the potatoes and grate them. Then you should place them in your kid’s socks
Use a fan – set it at low setting and leave it to circulate the air in the room, then blow directly at it.
Apply a damp and cool washcloth on the kid’s forehead.
If the kid is younger than 3 months and suffers from fever, you should take it directly to the doctor. Also, you must call or visit the doctor if the temperature is 101 degrees or higher. For 6 months old baby you should call the doctor if the temperature is 102 degrees. If you notice purple spots on the skin or difficulties while breathing you should call or visit the doctor immediately, even for kids older than 3 years because it could be a symptom of severe bacterial infection.

"A recently discovered set of original Nikola Tesla drawings reveal a map to multiplication that contains all numbers in a simple to use system. The drawings were discovered at an antique shop in central Phoenix Arizona by local artist, Abe Zucca. They are believed to have been created during the last years of Tesla’s Free Energy lab, Wardenclyffe. The manuscript is thought to contain many solutions to unanswered questions about mathematics.
The Sketches were hidden in a small trunk with numerous other drawings and manuscripts ranging from hand-held technological devices to free-energy systems, many with notes scrawled all over them. Some of the pieces are already familiar to the public, but a few others are not. Most notably is the Map to Multiplication or the Math Spiral. Zucca made a few copies and showed the drawings around to different thinkers, dreamers, and mathematicians.
A few days later a Local High School Mathematics Instructor, Joey Grether, had been working on deciphering the system and had a few breakthroughs. Grether suggests that the Spiral not only explores Multiplication as an interwoven web, but that it, “offers a comprehensive visual understanding of how all numbers are self-organized into 12 positions of composability.”
“This device allows us to see numbers as patterns, the formation of prime numbers, twin primes, Highly composite numbers, multiplication and division, as well as few other systems, I imagine, that are yet to be discovered.”
The diagram itself is very intuitive, allowing students to see how numbers all work together based on a spiral with 12 positions. 12, or 12x (multiples of 12) is the most highly composite system, which is why we have 12 months in a year, 12 inches in a foot, 24 hours in a day, etc. 12 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, and 6. So can all multiples of 12. For every 12 numbers there is a chance of 4 numbers being prime. They happen to fall in positions (think clock positions) 5, 7, 11, and 1.
Tesla is known for the quote “If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe.” It turns out that when the device is examined, the digital roots of the numbers in positions 3, 6, 9, and 12 constantly repeat the same sequence 3, 6, 9! Is this what Tesla was referring too? The self-organization of numbers and their digital roots?
Its hard to say, but Grether seems to think so. “This breakthrough is phenomenal. If we could get students all over the globe to use this technique, to play with it, and help figure out how to use it, we could overcome our cultural aversion to Mathematics. Instead of memorizing the multiplication table, we could learn the positions of numbers and have a better understanding of how they work.”
Juan Zapata, One of Mr. G’s students believes so as well… “I used to say I’m bad at Math… cause that’s what everyone says, but now, I’m like, dude, this is too easy.”
Theres one other fact about the Tesla Spiral that make it interesting. The diagram is dated 12/12/12! 1912. Grether and his students want to turn December 12 into a national holiday. So grab a 12 pack, get a dozen donuts, and celebrate the power of 12x.",1
"Sony is well aware of the damage a hacked account can cause, especially when it impacts an entire service such as the PlayStation Network. The latest Sony hack is on a much smaller scale, though, with the only real consequence being lots of upset Britney Spears fans.
According to Billboard, Sony Music Entertainment's @SonyMusicGlobal Twitter account got hacked, and the hacker decided to have some fun by informing the account's 614K followers that Britney Spears was dead.
The tweet read, ""RIP @britneyspears #RIPBritney 1981-2016."" It was followed with another tweet stating, ""britney spears is dead by accident! we will tell you more soon #RIPBritney."" To compound the issue, Bob Dylan's account was also hacked and the tweet ""Rest in peace @britneyspears"" posted.
At 35, Britney Spears dying would obviously cause shock and more than a few Google searches to find out exactly what happened. Sony Music reacted quickly, removing the fake tweets and apologizing ""to Britney Spears and her fans for any confusion.""
Shane Allen of Eye Opener TV managed to capture the tweets before they were removed.
Responsibility for the hack was claimed by the OurMine hacking group, which also recently managed to take control of the Netflix Twitter account, as well as those of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and even Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey.
Securing corporate Twitter accounts seems to be a task nobody wants to understand or undertake properly, not even Twitter's own chief. Until they do, or Twitter introduces another layer of security, OurMine looks likely to continue taking over high-profile Twitter targets and making it very clear there's a security issue to be resolved.",0
"77 Year Old Female Bodybuilder, “I’m Proof That Age Is Nothing But A Number”.
Ernestine Shepherd is the ultimate vision of inspiration. At 77 years old she does more than most people in their 20’s. She started working out at age 56 thanks to her sister, Velvet, that told her, “Let’s start working out!”
Shepherd gets up every morning at 2:30 AM to make her morning egg whites and proudly proclaims, “I don’t even need an alarm clock.”
Then, about an hour later, she puts on her headlamp and heads out for her 10 mile run with her husband Collin, 83. By 8 AM she is in the gym, and works out for about two hours.
This is a morning routine that woul put most 20-year-olds to the test. But this is just a regular day for Ernestine Shepherd, the world’s oldest female bodybuilder.
She follows a rigorous daily routine, which involves drinking several bottles of egg whites per day as part of her 1,700 cal a day diet of eggs, chicken and vegetables. Her mantra – “Dedication, determination, discipline to get fit”.
She inspires seniors as she works as a personal trainer at a local gym, her oldest client is 89. Shepherd said she is committed to helppeople “get healthy and exercise”.
When Ernestine sister, Velvet, first approached her at age 56 to get healthy, Shepherdsaid, about herself, that she was a “Sedentary, well padded school secretary and slug.” It then became their goal to get into the Guinness World Book of Records as the oldest bodybuilding sisters.
But before their dream came true, Velvet passed away after suffering a brain aneurysm in 1992. Shepherdwas hit hard by her sister’s death, and found herself struggling to keep going.
“After my sister died, I ended up with high blood pressure, panic attacks, high cholesterol, you name it, I had it,” Shepherd told TIME Magazine. She describes how the support of her family and God helped her get motivated to start running again, and that training took away all the aches and pain and lifted the veil of depression.
“I take no high blood pressure medication, no panic attack medication, have no acid reflux. By going out running, the depression and anxietyjust left me,” Shepherd said.
In March 2010, Shepherd was awarded the title of World’s Oldest Performing Female Bodybuilder by Guinness World Records. And although she no longer holds the title, she says she may gain it back one day, she has no plans of stopping.",1
"We've talked a lot about good books this summer, but our books editor Petra Mayer has been thinking about the bad, like villains in literature who get away with being bad.
PETRA MAYER, BYLINE: If we're going to talk about villains, let's talk about the biggest of the big bads, the granddaddy of ghouls, the imperator of iniquity, Satan himself. Specifically, the version of Satan set down by John Milton in ""Paradise Lost.""
MAYER: That's my high school English teacher Rhoda Trooboff. Like a lot of kids, I first encountered Milton's Satan and the idea that the villain could be more interesting than the hero in high school English class. And luckily, Ms. Trooboff still lives near me and was happy to read me some Milton.
TROOBOFF: (Reading) What matter where if I be still the same and what I should be all but less than he whom sunder has made great. Here at last, we shall be free. And then a bit later, (reading) better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.
MAYER: So he's kind of the ultimate getting-away-with-it guy.
TROOBOFF: Yes, and not just getting away with it, he brings his buddies into it. And together, they form a community that sounds, as they describe it, really exciting.
MAYER: Sure, he's been cast out of heaven, but Satan pretty much has it made in hell. Milton's Satan is the ancestor of our modern antiheroes, the kinds of guys who flip the fire of damnation into a blaze of glory. But the more reading I did for this story, the more I noticed another kind of unpunished villain, the kind who embodies an unbeatable system.
RICHARD BURTON: (As O'Brien) If you want a vision of the future, Winston, imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever.
MAYER: That's O'Brien, the terrifyingly calm Inner Party member in George Orwell's ""1984."" And that's the scene in the movie adaptation where he finally breaks protagonist Winston Smith, torturing him with a cage of rats until Smith betrays his lover Julia.
JOHN HURT: (As Winston Smith) I don't care what you do to her, but do it to her. Tear her face off and do it to Julia, not to me.
MAYER: Like death and taxes, O'Brien is inescapable. And like many successful villains, he truly believes in his cause.
VICTORIA SCHWAB: Those are the ones that tend to get away with it 'cause they don't get distracted.
MAYER: That's fantasy author Victoria Schwab. I caught up with her at this year's San Diego Comic-Con because she's kind of an expert on villains. A few years back, she set herself this challenge.
SCHWAB: If I wrote an entire book that only had bad people, could I make you root for one of them as though they were the hero?
MAYER: Schwab points to villains like the nobly murderous serial killer Dexter or the ""X-Men's"" long-running antagonist and occasional ally Magneto. And, yes, I know Magneto ends up in prison a lot, but he keeps coming back.
SCHWAB: They have their own ethics. They have their own system. They have their own code that they're following. So even if it's not our code, the fact that they do have a code, that they're not anarchic is something that I think readers and viewers find really appealing.
MAYER: And I think that's the real heart of the matter, the blackened, shriveled, evil heart because after all, it's the readers who want to see the bad guy get his just desserts. And it's the author who dispenses the punishment. So if you're a literary villain, here's some free advice. Adopt a cause, practice your smoldering glances and your withering quips because charming the audience is your key to getting away with it, whatever it happens to be.

"It was reported by ViralStuppid.com this week that former Players Club actress Ronnie is now working the night shift at Walmart in Orlando. Once the news got out, She wrote the following on Twitter:
“It’s funny how ppl make fun about real jobs and former celebrities we r human too and I have a family to provide for. So YES this is what happens when you no longer use what you got to get what you want”
“The biggest joke of all is I get paid way more at Walmart then I ever did as an actress and on time. Now I make the money I don’t let it make me”
“I started taking movie roles to live a dream/make money/tell stories/learn as much as I can to give back to the people”
“Don’t think that this is bitterness or pissed I’m not on TV no more Cuz remember I left the movie business they didn’t leave me.”

"NEW YORK — While declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency Thursday, President Donald Trump said: ""Nobody has seen anything like what's going on now.""
He was right, and he was wrong.
Yes, this is the most widespread and deadly drug crisis in the nation's history. But there has been a long string of other such epidemics, each sharing chilling similarities with today's unfolding tragedy.
There was an outbreak after the Civil War when soldiers and others became addicted to a new pharmaceutical called morphine, one of the first of many man-made opioids. There was another in the early 1900s after a different drug was developed to help ""cure"" morphine addiction. It was called heroin.
Cocaine was also developed by drugmakers and sold to help morphine addiction. It cleared nasal passages, too, and became the official remedy of the Hay Fever Association. In 1910, President William H. Taft told Congress that cocaine was the most serious drug problem the nation had ever faced.
Over the next century, abuse outbreaks of cocaine, heroin, and other drugs like methamphetamine, marketed as a diet drug, would emerge and then fall back.
""There are one or two or three wolves ahead of the pack that seem to be the most pressing threat, their jaws closest to you,"" said David Courtwright, a University of North Florida historian who has written books on U. S. drug epidemics. ""But there's always a pack. The history is that the lead wolves keep shifting.""
Trump vowed in his recent remarks ""we will free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse."" But the grim reality is that these drugs never disappear completely once they've emerged.
The good news, though, is that drug epidemics do fade considerably — usually because reduced supply and demand eventually diminish the number of new addictions, experts say. And that history offers some hope for the future.
Most U. S. drug epidemics over the past two centuries were sparked by pharmaceutical companies and physicians pushing products that gradually proved to be addictive and dangerous. In the 1800s the drug was often opium, usually sold as a liquid in products like laudanum, and given to patients for pain or trouble sleeping. Mary Todd Lincoln, President Lincoln's wife, took it for headaches and became addicted.
The drug was also used to get high. ""Opium fiends"" smoked it in opium dens like those in San Francisco's Chinatown. Rev. Frederick Masters, a 19th century Methodist missionary, described opium dens in that city as dark, fumy basements ""sepulcher-like in their silence save for the sputtering of opium pipes or the heavy breathing of their sleeping victims.""
The young nation's drug problem grew because of morphine, a painkiller derived from opium through a chemical process that was perfected by E. Merck & Company of Germany. It made battlefield injuries more bearable for Civil War soldiers, but so many veterans got hooked that morphine addiction was sometimes called ""the army disease.""
It would get worse. Cocaine and heroin were soon developed — in part to help morphine addiction.
Merck introduced cocaine, which became a prime ingredient in a variety of over-the-counter tonics for sinus problems and other ailments. Because of its energizing effects, beverage makers put it in their wines and sodas and laborers in the South sniffed it to get through grueling work shifts.
Bayer, another German pharmaceutical company, began marketing heroin in the 1890s. It often came in pill form, without prescription, and was used to treat the flu and respiratory ailments. But it came to be sniffed — and later injected — by those looking for a more intense high or a substitute for other drugs, whether it was morphine in 1905 or opioid pain pills like Vicodin in 2015.
In the early 1900s cocaine shifted from a consumer fad into reviled epidemic, as physicians began documenting addiction problems and police chiefs linked recreational cocaine use to prostitution and violent crime. It led to the first national effort to contain a drug epidemic: In 1914, Congress passed the Harrison Act, which said cocaine and heroin could be sold only as a prescription medicine, not in over-the-counter remedies or in consumer products.
Historians believe a growing stigma attached to cocaine use was the main reason the epidemic declined, but they say enforcement of the Harrison Act — and its impact on prices — also was important. Cocaine and heroin got much more expensive when they were driven underground.
Drugs were still abused in the later years in pockets of society — cocaine use was rampant in Hollywood in the 1920s, for example. But economics and politics helped prevent large-scale epidemics for a time. The Great Depression meant few had the disposable income for an illicit drug habit, and World War II decimated the supply of drugs from overseas.
""There's no customs patrol more efficient than a U-boat,"" said Courtwright, the University of North Florida historian.
Alcohol and cigarettes were — and remain — the nation's primary addictions. Both kill far more people than drugs. But since the middle of the century, there's been wave after wave of other drug abuse outbreaks.
Amphetamines, developed in the 1930s, took off in the 1950s. Marketed by drug companies and promoted by doctors, they were used for weight loss, anxiety and depression. Methamphetamine, developed by the Burroughs Wellcome drug company, was often prescribed as a diet pill and abused by those attracted by the surge of energy it produced. Users who injected it were known as ""speed freaks.""
""The speed freak is, in many ways, an outcast in a society of outcasts. He is regarded as a fool by heroin addicts, as insane and violent by those using psychedelics and marijuana, and a 'bust' by non-drug using hustlers,"" wrote Dr. Roger Smith, a criminologist who studied drug use in San Francisco in the late 1960s.
Greater regulation of the drugs in 1970, along with the stigma attached to speed freaks, caused the drugs to recede as others became more widely used.
In the 1960s and 1970s, heroin use surged, prompted in part by Vietnam War soldiers who were exposed to it while fighting overseas. Unlike the doctor-driven previous drug epidemics, this one victimized poor inner-city neighborhoods most.
In 1970 and 1971, in New York City, more adolescents, many of them black and Puerto Rican, died of heroin-related incidents than any other cause. There was little compassion then for heroin addicts, recalled John de Miranda, a longtime addiction professional who worked with homeless men in Boston's South End in the early 1970s. ""We basically cared for the men nobody else wanted to deal with,"" he said.
President Richard Nixon's 1971 ""war on drugs"" declaration kicked off a long period of attacking the drug problem with beefed up law enforcement and tougher sentences for users and dealers. The approach did cut down foreign shipments of heroin and marijuana, but those successes were temporary and many historians argue Nixon's war ultimately was a losing effort.
Heroin use faded in the late '70s, but cocaine was on its way back, first in powder form and then becoming an epidemic of crack in the 1980s when a supply glut prompted dealers to sell hardened cocaine rocks that sold for $5 to $10 on the street.
Many young thrill-seekers, wary of heroin and needles, thought crack was less dangerous because it was smoked like marijuana.
Like the heroin surge before it, crack was seen as tied to urban blight and violent crime. This triggered a new drug war, including the ""this is your brain on drugs"" TV spots that showed frying eggs, and harsh jail sentences for the sale and possession of crack that were far more severe than the penalties for regular cocaine.
The crack epidemic died out in the 1990s, tailing off at roughly the same time both in cities that aggressively arrested people and cities that didn't. Experts said the police crackdown contributed, but more important was society's growing repulsion to the drugs. Families and communities were shattered by crack-related murders and arrests. The drug's users came to be regarded as disgraceful ""crackheads."" Even risk-taking kids, looking for new highs, started to avoid crack.
In 1900, when cocaine and heroin were legal and popular, there were 250,000 Americans with a drug addiction, according to one historical estimate. That was about 1 in 300 Americans. The estimate today is 1 in 133, and the drugs are deadlier than ever.
""In all my years I've worked in the substance abuse field, I've never had so many patients die,"" said Joan Hartman, vice president of behavioral health services for Illinois-based Chestnut Health Systems, who has been working in treatment for three decades.
There were fewer than 3,000 overdose deaths in 1970, when a heroin epidemic was raging in U. S. cities. There were fewer than 5,000 recorded in 1988, around the height of the crack epidemic.
More than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last year, according to the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
This epidemic started around 1995, kicked off by a drug called OxyContin, which like heroin and morphine before it, was meant to be a safer and more effective opioid. OxyContin and competitor drugs were designed to release the medication slowly over long periods of time, making them and supposedly safe and effective enough to use for months to treat chronic pain. But patients found themselves hooked and wanting more, and drug abusers found they could crush the tablets and snort or inject them, delivering the drug to the bloodstream much more quickly.
Aggressive marketing and distribution pushed hundreds of millions of pills into communities. Then more and more addicts turned to cheaper alternatives, bought illegally, like heroin and fentanyl, an opioid medication developed to treat intense, end-of-life pain in cancer patients that is 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine.
""It's a very complex epidemic"" that is nowhere close to being over, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director, in an interview earlier this year.
What has worked for previous epidemics?
The supply is often reduced by a combination of regulations, law enforcement and economics. And historians say that demand slows when drug users became so outcast that even those looking for a risky thrill or a way to escape began to stay away.
Past epidemics have also shown what doesn't work. Many experts, including some in law enforcement, say that arresting users and dealers does not seem to slow epidemics. ""We cannot arrest our way out of the heroin and opioid addiction crisis,"" said Brian Moran, Virginia's secretary of public safety and homeland security, speaking at a federal hearing in July.
But while health experts want to urge people to shun drugs to reduce the number of new addictions, they say ostracizing the people already suffering from addiction does little to help them. It may even impede attempts to get people into treatment, Hartman said.
Health officials are fighting the current epidemic on three fronts: Preventing overdose deaths, helping people recover from addiction, and preventing new addictions.
There appears to be some success on the first front. The number of new addictions may be receding.
A recent federal report noted a downward trend in ""opioid misuse"" in adults younger than 50. Prescription rates are falling, though they remain far higher than years ago. And according to a closely watched University of Michigan study of adolescents, use of the opioids OxyContin and Vicodin has been low and falling for several years. In 2016, heroin use was the lowest in the survey's 41-year history.
""I suspect we may be past the peak (of the epidemic), at least in terms of initiation,"" said Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.
The other two fronts — preventing deaths and treating addiction — are not so promising, despite more attention and money flowing to programs. Deaths are still rising, and University of Pittsburgh researchers estimate as many as 300,000 will die from overdoses over the next five years.
""Honestly, we're at a point where the horses are out of the barn after the gate has closed,"" said Dan Werb, an expert at the University of California, San Diego. ""I'm not optimistic about the capacity of our classic approaches to rein this in.""",0
"Medical professionals often refer to colorectal cancer, which includes colon cancer that affects the large intestine and rectal cancer that affects the lower most part of the large intestine.
According to the American Cancer Society, 1 in 20 people are at a risk of developing colorectal cancer during their lifetime.
The exact cause of colorectal or bowel cancer is not known. However, it is believed to develop when healthy cells become abnormal and start growing in number and accumulate in the lining of the colon, forming polyps. Left untreated, polyps may become cancerous.
Several factors increase your risk of developing colon and rectal cancer, including aging (above 50 years), some types of bowel diseases, family history, obesity, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, a sedentary lifestyle, Type 2 diabetes and regular intake of processed foods or red meats.
African-Americans are at a greater risk of colon cancer than people of other races.
As it can be difficult to treat colon cancer after it spreads to nearby areas, it is important to know what the early symptoms are. This can help you seek early treatment and give you a better chance in recovery.
Here are the top 10 warning signs of colon cancer you shouldn’t ignore.
Constipation is an important sign of cancer in the colon. A 2011 study published in the Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention highlights the link between constipation and colorectal cancer risk.
An earlier 2004 study published in the European Journal of Cancer supported the hypothesis that constipation or laxative use increases the risk of colon cancer.
A tumor present at the far end of the colon can make it very difficult to eliminate waste products, thereby causing constipation.
If you persistently have fewer bowel movements per week, without any prior problem of constipation, consult your doctor to find out the exact cause.
If you suffer from diarrhea for more than a couple of weeks, it may be an early symptom of colon cancer.
When a tumor partially obstructsthe bowel, it can cause alternating constipation and diarrhea due toleakage of liquid stool.
You may alsoexperience frequent gas, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Plus, a tumor may irritate or narrow the lining of the intestine.
It is important to consult your doctor when you have diarrhea that lasts more than a few days, as it can lead to dehydration, drain your body of nutrients and signal other serious problems, such as cancer.
Most often, blood in the stool is due to piles (hemorrhoids), where the veins in the back passage become fragile and cause a little bleeding during a bowel movement. This type of bleeding is generally red.
However, if you notice dark red or black blood in your stool, it can be a sign of cancer, such as bowel, rectal or colon cancer. It can also be due to a stomach ulcer.
Whether bleeding is due to piles, a stomach ulcer or cancer, it’s important to get it checked by a doctor. Proper diagnosis is essential for appropriate treatment.
If you have a constant feeling of urgently needing to have a bowel movement or to strain but no stool is passed, it is not a good sign. This feeling can occur even after having a bowel movement.
Changes in your pattern of bowel movements can be a sign of colon cancer. It can occur when a tumor blocks the bowel and prevents you from completely emptying your bowels.
If you persistently have the sensation of incomplete evacuation after a bowel movement, discuss the problem with your doctor.
Thin, narrow stools are also a warning of possible colon cancer. A tumor present in the left side of the colon obstructs the passageway and often leads to narrow stools.
Do not delay discussing any change in your stools with your doctor. Diverticulitis and anal cancer can also cause narrowing of the stools.
If your abdomen, especially the lower part, hurts or feels tender when touched, this can be an early indication of tumor growth in the digestive tract, colon or rectum. In fact, abdominal pain is common in people who are later diagnosed with colon cancer.
A tumor can cause a block in the colon, restricting blood flow. This leads to abdominal pain that can be severe. Thispain also can indicate that the cancer has begun to spread to other organs.
If abdominal pain or tenderness persists for more than 2 to 3 days, consult your doctor for proper diagnosis.
Anemia refers to a low red blood cell count in the body. The hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen throughout the body.
Symptoms of anemia, such as pale skin, a fast or irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizziness, and cold hands and feet, should not be taken lightly.
Unexplained anemia may be due to colon cancer. Typically, cancer in the right-side of the colon causes iron-deficiency anemia. This happens when tumors start bleeding slowly into the digestive tract, causing blood loss over time.
A 2008 study published in the British Journal of Cancer confirms a strong connection between anemia and cancer, with the risk rising as the hemoglobin level falls. This study also confirms iron deficiency as an independent predictor of cancer.
If you have signs of anemia, consult your doctor immediately to get your hemoglobin level checked.
If you are above the age of 50 and rapidly losing weight without any known reason, it is a cause for concern. Sudden, unexplained weight loss can indicate a serious health problem, including colon or rectal cancer.
A 2006 study published in the Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England found that unexplained weight loss happens mostly during advanced stages of colorectal cancers.
The growth of a tumor can lead to loss of appetite, as cancer can affect your metabolism, thus causing weight loss.
If you are rapidly losing weight without changing your diet or exercise routine, discuss this with your doctor.
Another early symptom of colon cancer is fatigue, weakness and general malaise. Fatigue and tiredness after doing a laborious task is to be expected, but if you feel tired and weak most of the time, despite resting, do not take it lightly.
Large polyps or tumors in the colon can lead to iron-deficiency anemia that causes lower oxygen levels in the blood. This contributes to fatigue.
Fatigue and weakness can also be related to a number of chronic illnesses and medical disorders, so visit your doctor to find out the exact cause.
Most people suffer from gas and bloating occasionally, but if the problem occurs along with some of the other symptoms mentioned here, it may be an indication of a tumor growing in the colon.
A tumor causes obstruction in the colon. Depending on the severity of the blockage, gas, solid and liquid may be prevented from passing out of the body. This in turn causes progressive bloating as well as gas.
If you have a lot of discomfort due to gas and bloating, see a doctor to rule out the possibility of cancer.
Tips to reduce your risk of colon cancer:
* Include a variety of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables and whole grains in your diet.
* Avoid drinking alcohol, or at least drink in moderation.
* Stop smoking and use of other tobacco products.
* Exercise for at least 30 to 40 minutes, 5 times a week.
* If you are overweight, take steps to lose weight gradually.
* Opt for regular screening tests to help prevent colon cancer.",1
"Seriously, who even likes a doctor’s hand up their vagina? I know I don’t. Even when you tell yourself they are a professional and this is just for health reasons, it still gets awkward at one point. And sometimes, you can’t ask them specific questions because you’re too shy. Asking about sex positions, new lubes, etc. can prove to be awkward. However, there are some things your gynecologist wants you to stop doing before you visit them.
Scroll below to find them out:
Most people think they should start getting checkups until after they have sex. This is a huge misconception most people have. You need to start getting yourself checked as soon as you begin menstruating because doctors need to have your medical history.
Go to a doctor you trust. Since they have to go inside you literally, it’s better if you go to someone you are comfortable with. If things seem awkwardwith a specific doctor, just switch to another one.
Do not stop yourself from asking questions if they are awkward. Breasts, sexual intercourse, vagina, whatever it is. Be open with your doctor because they are not there to personally judge you, they are there to treat you. And they have probably heard worse.
It does not matter to your doctor if you’re waxed or not. Do not get Brazilian wax before your appointment because it makes your vagina swell. This makes it hard for the doctor to recognize if you have an infection or just inflammation from the wax. However, you do need to be careful of pubic lice and rashes.
You won’t take Urinary Tract Infections seriously until you feel that burning pain inside your vagina when you pee. If you feel even the slightest bit of irritation when you pee, get yourself checked. It is not a joke and it can get worse with time.
Yes, a perfumed vagina may seem nice and all, but it’s not worth the irritation. These scented soaps and lotions can cause yeast infections andBacterial Vaginosis. Also, don’t use scented pads and tampons. Stay simple, ladies.
Please do not use perfumed or scented sex lubes. These can also irritate your vagina. Even if youreallywant to use them, make sure you aren’t allergic to them.
Unless you’re planning to have a baby, do not skip protection. Make sure you’re on the pill or use a condom when you have sex. This can save you from sexually transmitted diseases and infections. You can ask your doctor all kinds of questions to guide you; it is their job to help you.
It doesn’t matter what your partner says to you; not everyone is honest even if you believe them. Get yourself tested no matter what.
Even if you assume you don’t need to get checked, please just do. It is essential to have a doctor who is up to date with your health.",1
"By anyone’s standards, the town of Ennemain is tiny, just a few hundred people nestled among sleepy fields two hours north of Paris. By American standards, it is also startlingly lovely, and very old. With its old brick houses and its winding roads, Ennemain is easily imaginable as it looked in 1793 -- when the population was, yes, several hundred people.
I was in Ennemain because it was the site of Marine Le Pen’s last rally in the runoff of the French presidential election. I was given a very thorough pat-down on my way in, but otherwise, it was a charmingly informal thing: A bandstand was set up at an intersection, abutting the streets filled with a few rides, some stands, children shrieking in joy. The crowd assembled itself on a bank facing the stage; some of the younger attendees climbed up on a stack of hay bales to get a better view. As soon as Le Pen left the stage, a band started playing, loud. There was no question what century those amplifiers came from.
In between, Le Pen spoke, and the crowd cheered. The cars parked along the roads held license plates from many parts of the country, but nonetheless, it was not a large crowd. They did their best to make up for it in enthusiasm. French flags vibrated madly; chants of “Marine le Presidente” swept across the crowd in waves. Le Pen beamed like a mischievous cherub.
Her speech was roughly what people have come to expect from her -- “They’re all the same,” I was told when I asked a few Le Pen groupies how this rally compared to others they’d attended. She derided “the system”: “The system doesn’t like it when you ruffle the feathers of the teacher’s pet,” she said, a clear reference to Macron’s marriage to his high-school drama coach. She said that Macron was putty in the hands of radical Islamists, though contrary to my expectations, at least, she did take the time to say that radical Islam was a perverted and minority form of Islam. And she praised the people there a lot. The gist of the praise will be very familiar to Americans: the salt of the earth, the spine of the body politic, the heart of the country. “I am proud to have been your voice, and I’m sorry if it hurt their ears,” she told them. A bit later, she added “We are France, wherever we are.”
And Le Pen’s basic promise is to protect those people from powerful outside forces that threaten them. Protect their jobs, lower the taxes that rob the French people of the product of their hard work, and root out the terrorist groups from French soil. “I will shut down radical mosques,” she promised. “I will throw radical preachers out of the country. I will strip terrorists of their citizenship. I will ban radical Islamist groups proliferating on our territory.” Each sentence was punctuated by fervent chanting: “We love you, we trust you.”
The echoes of a Donald Trump rally rang louder than those amplifiers.
The details differ, but the framework is the same. Security, prosperity, and rage against a smug cosmopolitan elite that has taken those things from the ordinary classes and divided that birthright between poor strangers and themselves.
I met a number of those people after the rally, and frankly they seemed a whole lot like the people I know from the small town in Western New York where my mother grew up. They’re nice people who do unglamorous jobs -- driving a school bus, working as a secretary, running a florist’s shop. They know each other with an intimacy that is foreign to a city girl like me.
These people have long been conservative, but quietly so. Then something happened that was the last straw. Legalized abortion. Taxes that squeeze their small business so that they struggle to make a profit, or pay their employees what they’d like. A failing job market that forces their sons and daughters to move away looking for work. Foreigners who know little and care less about a way of life they treasure, one that is deeply embedded in a particular place, a specific set of cultural practices, a group of people with ties to each other that flow back through the centuries. They don’t want that old way of life to become one tiny thread in a magnificent multicultural tapestry, because most of what they love about it will be lost within the more numerous and brilliant colors of other places.
No one I talked to made explicitly racist remarks. They talked about terrorism, of course, but Islamist terrorism is not just something they’ve imagined for the sole purpose of blackguarding helpless strangers. It's a real and recurring problem in France. They didn’t make nasty remarks about immigrants or Muslims. What they did talk about was honesty. Every single person I spoke to mentioned it. They liked Le Pen because she was honest. She would do what she said, because she was honest. Macron was an untrustworthy liar; Le Pen says what she means, and means what she says.
This struck me particularly because I heard the exact same thing from Trump supporters, over and over and over. This was, to a policy journalist, fairly astonishing, given Trump’s remarkable penchant for … well, let us say, creatively editing facts to suit his obsession of the moment. But ""honesty"" has more than one meaning, and over time, I came to see that what they meant by ""honest"" was not “makes only true claims”; they meant “refuses to self-edit his opinions in order to keep the respect of elite society.”
Conor Friedersdorf of the Atlantic recently noted that as the list of things that must not be said has proliferated, a growing class of Americans have come to view these proscriptions as less about decency and more about manners -- the manners of an elite class that despises them, and seeks to punish them for the linguistic equivalent of not knowing how to use an oyster fork. They are sick of that class, sick of being looked down upon as their old way of life disappears and their communities implode. And so they rejoice when someone is willing to transgress its edicts.
What I heard from Le Pen supporters sounded an awful lot like what I heard from those Trump voters. Neither France nor the U. S. would be a better place if people felt freer to make racist remarks. But they probably would be better if no one class felt comfortable disdaining another. They would probably also be much less angry, fractured and ungovernable.
Getting there probably starts by recognizing that Trump and Le Pen supporters are not simply interested in the joy of hate. Call it xenophobia, or nationalism, or whatever you like, it still has an affirmative as well as a negative aspect. People deeply rooted in their own place -- be it a small town in northern France or a small town in Iowa -- have depth in their locations and their histories rather than breadth of experience in the modern lives of many kinds of people from many places. Those deep lives really are in tension with the multicultural dream, a tension that cannot be erased by platitudes about diversity.
I can easily see why people want to fight for the beauty of Ennemain, as it is now and has been for a long time. The question for France, and for America, is why the people who want to preserve that beauty are resorting to such ugly rhetoric.

"When Andover, Massachusetts school superintendent Sheldon Berman noticed his son browsing colleges, he noted something unusual.
The teen was doing it all from his couch.
He was watching tour videos on YouTube, messaging his friends, comparing and contrasting reviews, receiving answers to his questions — and was close to making a decision — without moving a muscle.
""He was out in front of it. He analyzed the data that they had available, the majors, the professors, reputation, what the ratio was of girls to boys,"" Berman said of his son’s strategy. ""It was pretty interesting to see.""
Of course, no school-savvy family would forego the traditional in-person visits, and Berman and his son did make the campus-to-campus trek before finally landing at his chosen spot.
To parents, the process of researching colleges will (as with most things) look vastly different from what it was in their day. In the past, a college's marketing effort may have been limited to a few pamphlets that showed up in the mail. But these days, schools are turning on the charm.
There are two major players in college standings: yield rates and retention rates. Yield is how many accepted students actually accept a school back (the leader for the class of 2020, in case you’re wondering, is Brown University). And retention is how many matriculate as a freshman — and then return for sophomore year.
Both are highly fought-for, and many experts believe that even elite schools will have to start working harder to maintain theirs in upcoming years as the race for top students intensifies.
As a result, the outreach has changed. Parents of sophomores and juniors, especially those who’ve begun taking standardized tests, may notice an uptick in material coming at them. That’s because the College Board, which administers the SAT, shares optional data that students and parents provide.
In addition to the ubiquitous virtual tours, colleges are advertising on music-streaming services, on YouTube, Facebook, and have even joined Snapchat — in the case of Dartmouth College and others, whose newspapers are available via the app's Discover section.
For college counselors, the marketing strategies raise a new question: How do you ensure students see past the bells and whistles to find schools that are right for them?
""The ethical thing is to educate the student on what is appropriate research,"" said Juaquin Moya, a college admissions counselor for IvyWise. ""It does get a little murky in terms of what resources you’re using and understanding what may be biased or may not be accurate.""
When done right, creative marketing efforts really work. Two years ago, prospective students who got into the Savannah College of Art and Design received virtual reality headsets that gave them a 360-degree tour of campus.
This year, the catalog came to life thanks to a scanning-enabled app that conjures dazzling videos and animations.
The high-tech admissions tactic actually encouraged students to make a real-life visit, said Dave Hanak, SCAD’s executive director of Interactive Services, and the school considers it a huge success.
“One thing that we took a leap on was the fact that when we did the VR tours, back in 2015, there was a fear behind it of, ‘if we send this information to the students, they’re not going to want to come to us, they’re going to see it in their virtual environment.’ We saw the exact opposite impact. Which was fantastic. They ended up coming to our admission events.”
SCAD was able to reach a global audience, while staying true to the school spirit of innovation and creativity.
No matter what information is flying at your high school-aged kid, college counselors urge students to do their research independently and through reputable sources — and sort carefully through what comes at them via social media or promotional messages.
“When you talk about how you’re being bombarded by constant emails — these gimmicky approaches to entice someone to apply — help your student understand what their needs are first,” said Moya. “Then, go through the research and understand what’s really a reliable source and what’s perhaps less credible.”
In other words, said Moya, remember that regardless of catchy taglines, what matters is that it’s the right institution for you.
“What I love about college counseling is helping young people come into their own and use the process as sort of a self-discovery.”",0
"Reduces Stress
Cold water relaxes the body thus reducing stress. As per a research study on the effects of ice-cold water it was shown that it can improve the tolerance of stress, particularly if you swim in it. Likewise, applying cold water onto your face slows down the heart rate, which is very good for the treatment of abnormally fast heart rates.
Supports Blood Circulation
Persons struggling with heart or circulatory issues should start showering with cold water so that they can improve blood circulation and promote better oxygen and nutrient supply within the body.
Prevents Varicose Veins
Since the cold water has the ability to improve the blood flow and as well as vascular constriction this will help in lowering and preventing the appearance of varicose veins.
Soothes Sore Muscles
Having cold showers can help with relieving the muscle pain and inflammation after a strenuous workout. Just focus the shower on the afflicted muscle for 5 minutes thereby increasing the blood flow in this place which will repair the tissues and reduce the pain.
Stimulates Immune System Function
The function of the immune system is getting improved by the use of cold showers as a result of the quick body reaction to cold water. By doing so, the body learns to respond faster when fighting with viruses and bacteria.
Boosts Your Mood
Having cold showers will increase the levels of beta-endorphin and noradrenalin in the blood and consequently in the brain which serve as an anti-depressant.
Better Skin Quality
When you are washing your face, start with warm water and then use cold water for best quality of your skin. Thanks to the use of cold water the skin pores will become tightened and the puffiness under the eyes reduced.
Better Hair Quality
After you have applied the conditioner onto your hair; rinse it with cold water so that it looks shinier and smoother. The use of cold water will flatten the hair follicles and lock the moisture which will provide your hair with a shining effect.
Improves Psychological Alertness and Focus
Cold showers are really good for this matter as the cold awakens the body and improves the breathing thereby raising the oxygen intake.
Prevents Depression
Cold showers are recommended to people who suffer from depression. Many health experts consider that this practice helpful. Moreover, it has even been found out that exposing the brain to cold temperatures can reduce the brain inflammation.",1

"A pastor nicknamed the ‘Prophet of Doom, is recently been the center of controversy because of his unorthodox ‘healing’ methods.
Lethebo Rabalago, a self-proclaimed prophet, literally uses an insecticide called ‘Doom’ and sprays it to people’s eyes and other body parts. He claims it can heal people from different diseases – including cancer and HIV.
Rabalago, who runs the Mount Zion General Assembly church in the province of Limpopo, has been slammed by different denominations and churches for his strange practice.
In an interview with local news website Herald Live, Rabalago said that his actions were intended to glorify God.
“It’s not a matter of inspiration. When one is inspired you are copying. It’s not a matter of inspiration. No one inspired me. I just believe in God for anything. We can use anything that you believe to heal people.”
“While we believe that the Bible teaches that the Lord Jesus Christ healed people of all manner of diseases and ailments during His earthly ministry He always did so in a way that protected their dignity as human beings made in the image of God.
What’s your take on this topic, folks? Do you think Rabalago’s actions are okay or unacceptable? Hit us up in the comment section below!",1
"Avocados are one of the wonderful fruits of summer. High in nutrition and flavor, nothing signals the start of summer like a zesty lime guacamole dip with tortilla chips. The next time you’re making guacamole or slicing an avocado for a salad, try saving your pits to grow into avocado trees. It’s surprisingly easy to grow your own avocado tree from seed, and it makes a great educational project for home and classrooms. Check out our handy-dandy guide below, complete with photos, to learn how to grow an avocado tree from seed.
You’ll need to start by removing the pit from the avocado carefully (without cutting it), and then washing it clean of all the avocado fruit (often it helps to soak the pit in some water for a few minutes and then scrub all the remaining fruit off). Be careful not to remove the brown skin on the pit – that is the seed cover.
Some avocado pits are slightly oblong, whereas others are shaped almost like perfect spheres – but all avocado pits have a ‘bottom’ (from where the roots will grow), and a ‘top’ (from which the sprout will grow). The slightly pointier end is the top, and the flat end is the bottom. In order to get your pit to sprout, you will need to place the bottom root end in water, so it’s very important to figure out which end is the ‘top’ and which is the ‘bottom’ before you go piercing it with toothpicks.
Take four toothpicks and stick them at a slight downward angle into the avocado seed, spaced evenly around the circumference of the avocado. These toothpicks are your avocado scaffolding, which will allow you to rest the bottom half of the avocado in water, so therefore the toothpicks need to be wedged in there firmly. I recommend sticking them in at a slight angle (pointing down), so that more of your avocado base rests in the water when you set this over a glass.
And set on a quiet windowsill with sunlight. It’s helpful to use a clear glass so you can easily see when roots start to grow, and also when the water needs to be changed. Many guides recommend to change the water every day, but I found, through trial and error, that it is better to change the water every five days to a week or so. You do want to make sure you change the water regularly, to preventmold, bacteria and fungus growth, which can doom your little avocado sprout.
Many online guides I have read say that sprouting can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks, but in my experience, it usually takes at least 8 weeks to get a sprout, so be patient. Here is the process you will witness:
1. The top of the avocado pit will dry out and form a crack, and the outer brown seed skin will slough off.
2. The crack will extend all the way to the bottom of the avocado pit, and through the crack at the bottom, a tiny taproot will begin to emerge.
3. The taproot will grow longer and longer (and may branch), and eventually a small sprout will peek through the top of the avocado pit.
4. Do not allow your taproot to dry out unsubmerged EVER – doing so will be the death of your plant.
When the stem is 6-7 inches long, cut it back to about 3 inches, this will encourage new growth. When it hits 6-7 inches again, pot it up in a rich humus soil in an 8-10″ diameter pot, leaving the top half of the seed exposed. Place on a sunny windowsill. Avocados love sun – the more sun the better.
Give it frequent waterings with an occasional deep soak. The soil should always be moist, but not saturated. Yellowing leaves are a sign of over-watering; let the plant dry out for a few days.
When the stem reaches 12 inches tall, pinch out the top two sets of leaves. This will encourage the plant to grow side shoots and more leaves, making it bushy. Each time the plant grows another 6 inches pinch out the 2 newest sets of leaves on top.
My avocado trees seem to collect aphids – the nasty critters can’t get enough of the delicious avocado leaves. If you get them, here’s how to get rid of them: Wash all of the aphids off the plant by spraying your plant down with a hose outside or in the sink/shower. Once the little pests are off, spray your plant with a mixture of water with a small squirt of dishwashing liquid and a teaspoon of neem oil. This will keep aphids from returning. Check your plant every 4-5 days and re-clean and spray when necessary.
Baby avocado trees can kick it outdoors in summer, but if you live anywhere where it gets cooler than 45 degrees F, you’ll need to bring them back indoors in the fall/winter, before the temperatures fall.
Hard to say! Sometimes avocado plants will begin growing fruit after they’re 3 or 4 years old, others take 15+ years to grow fruit, and some never do. It helps to have several avocado trees growing together to aid with pollination. However, don’t expect the fruit to be anything like the avocado that yielded your seed. Commercial avocados are grown from grafted branches to control the outcome of the fruit – a naturally grown avocado may be very different than its parent!",1
"Fossil fuels have powered our society for more than a century. But our energy mix is undergoing a transformation toward low-carbon alternatives such as wind and solar, in order to cut carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. Using these fairly new energy sources naturally raises questions about how they work and why they are better options than fossil fuels. Here are five common myths about renewable energy.
Solar and wind energy are relative newcomers to our electric grid, so they have yet to become major sources of electricity. But their low-carbon footprints are winning fans among consumers and businesses. In fact, a solar energy system was installed every two and a half minutes across the United States in 2014. Utilities in many states are increasingly serving clean energy to their customers. In California, more than a fifth of the electricity comes from renewable sources, and that is set to increase to a third by 2020. Businesses, such as Target and Ben & Jerry’s, along with the homes of dozens of major sports teams such as the New England Patriots and the San Francisco 49ers, all rely on solar for part of their energy needs.
New technology tends to come down in cost as it becomes more commonplace. The same has been true for renewable energy. For example, the cost of operating a wind power plant has dropped nearly 60% since 2009. New wind farms that come online in 2020 are expected to cost less to operate than coal or natural gas power plants. Solar is getting cheaper for consumers, too. The average price for a home solar energy system fell about 49% since 2009. More financing options, from leases to loans, are making solar energy more affordable — it can even lower your monthly utility bills. Renewable energy already costs comparatively or even less than fossil fuel power in some places in the world.
Just because wind and solar power plants can’t generate electricity around the clock doesn’t mean they cannot be reliable energy sources. Wind and solar complement each other because wind tends to kick up speed at night, causing turbines to generate more electricity, while solar energy production takes place during the day. The emergence of batteries and other energy storage equipment also makes it possible to bank solar and wind energy and give utilities the flexibility to use it whenever there’s demand, not just when the energy is produced. Other types of renewable energy, such as hydropower, geothermal and biomass, are able to produce electricity around the clock.
With far fewer models than gasoline cars, electric cars may not show up in automotive ads as frequently to catch your attention. But that doesn’t mean they are far more expensive. Four electric car models currently have a starting price of less than $30,000, before factoring in federal or state incentives. Consumers who love luxury cars can now choose electric BMW and Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Using electricity to power cars tends to be cheaper than relying on gasoline. Maintenance costs for electric cars also are projected to be less. With zero emissions and lower cost of ownership, electric cars are not just making their way to consumers’ garages; they also are being added to corporate and taxi fleets.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries, which can pack far more energy and last longer than the lead-acid batteries that sit next to the engine of the gasoline cars. Instead of lasting a few years, lithium-ion batteries are projected to last more than 10 years. Electric car makers such as Nissan and Tesla Motors are offering eight-year battery warranties. After that use, batteries may not hold enough charge to provide the quick burst of power needed to run a car, but they should still be able to store plenty of electricity (70-80%) and could find a second life, such as storing excess electricity from rooftop solar panels. Battery and car makers also are working on boosting how much batteries can hold energy – which extends the driving range per charge – without increasing their size and weight.

Most American households are stocked with some sort of over the counter, topical antiseptic and antibiotic. Antiseptic sprays and ointments are used to prevent infections in cuts, scrapes, and wounds, while antibiotics destroy micro-organisms already inside the body. But according to MedScape, reports of infection from the use of over the counter antiseptics have led the Food and Drug Administration to re-evaluate how these products are labeled.
Instead of relying on store-bought products when treating a cut or wound, we recommend opening your kitchen cabinet and using products you already have at home to prevent and treat infection. DermNet NZ explains antiseptics prevent infection by reducing the number of micro-organisms living on the surface of the skin or tissue. However, if the micro-organisms get into the tissue, then antibiotics are necessary for treatment.
1. Potato. This might seem seriously weird, but applying a poultice made from raw shredded potato to the wound can reduce inflammation and prevent infection, says Live Love Fruit. To make a homemade poultice, spread shredded raw potato onto a clean cloth. Apply the cloth to the affected area and cover first with gauze, then with plastic wrap. Leave the poultice on overnight and remove it in the morning. Be sure to clean the affected area with salt water before dressing it again.
2. Honey. Enzymes and anti-viral compounds found in honey make this a sticky, sweet solution. According to Health 911, researchers at Waikato University in New Zealand found that honey is so effective as an anti-bacterial agent, it can completely stop the growth of every major species of bacteria known to infect wounds.
3. Tea tree oil. Regularly found in grocery stores, tea tree oil is “an exceptional natural antibiotic,” according to Health 911. It is also an antiseptic, making it a first line of defense against infection. To use tea tree oil, dilute it by mixing 1 1/2 teaspoons of the essential oil in 1 cup of warm water. Use gauze to apply the diluted solution to the cut or wound.
4. Garlic. A single clove of garlic can make a world of a difference in the fight against infection. Live Love Fruit recommends mixing 3 crushed garlic cloves in one cup of wine. Let the solution sit for 2- 3 hours and then strain. Using a clean cloth or gauze, apply the anti-bacterial mixture to the wound 1- 2 times daily.
5. Cayenne Pepper. This hot spice is a sizzling disinfectant with anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties. It is a little known fact that applying cayenne pepper to a bleeding cut could stop the bleeding in an amazing 10- 12 seconds, according to Live Love Fruit. To treat a wound from the inside out, drink 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper dissolved in an 8 ounce glass of water.
6. Coconut oil. This magic antibacterial and anti-fungal is effective not only in healing wounds and preventing infection, but also in preventing scarring. Live Love Fruit recommends applying coconut oil to the wound and then covering it with a bandaid. The bandaid should be refreshed 2- 3 times daily.
7. Oregano oil. Not only can you put oregano oil on your salad, but you can also use it to treat a cut or wound, says Health Wire. This is because oregano is an anti-microbial, anti-bacterials, anti-parasitic, anti-viral, and ant-fungal.
8. Onion. Like its counterpart garlic, onion is a fabulous antibacterial and antiseptic. Natural Society says in addition to rubbing raw onion directly on the wound, you can simply leave a raw onion out in your kitchen to protect against unwanted bacteria.
When treating a cut, scrape, or wound, there is no need to run out to the drugstore. Remember, the essentials you likely keep in your home, like garlic and onions, are potent defenses against infection.

"The idea of gardening indoors during the winter can be daunting. It’s easy to feel defeated by the low levels of sunlight and the limited amount of space. But some crops are excellent choices to grow inside during the winter, and mushrooms are one. They will happily grow in a plastic bucket, a chunk of log or a seedling flat — and they require minimal space. Plus, the naturally dark and cool winter environment suits them perfectly.
Mushrooms are little health warriors. Carb-free, gluten-free, low in calories and sodium, and nutrient-rich, they are incredibly healthy. Different varieties of mushrooms are packed with nutrients like potassium, selenium, iron, and vitamins B2 (riboflavin) and B3 (niacin). Mushrooms enhance our immune systems and lower hypertension and cholesterol. Their meat-like texture makes them ideal meat substitutes.
There’s no doubt that mushrooms are healthy, but how feasible is it to grow them in our homes? Many of us have heard stories about mushrooms being grown in places like abandoned mines. Plus, mushrooms grow from microscopic spores, instead of seeds. Still, believe it or not, mushrooms are fairly easy — and fun — to grow.
Mushroom spores need to be mixed with a nutrient-rich base like sawdust, grain or straw. This mixture will develop mycelium: thin, soft, white threads (think of mold). Once mycelium develops, it’s called “spawn.” For the best mushroom crop, spawn should be spread on a substrate (base material). Common substrates include cardboard, straw, logs, manure and grain; but other materials like coffee grounds and tea leaves can be used.
Because each variety prefers different substrates and growing conditions, getting a mushroom harvest is a bit of an art. First-time growers should consider using a kit. Kits come complete with spawn, substrate, instructions, and often additional supplies like water misters and plastic sheeting. Growing mushrooms from kits is a breeze, and it offers a terrific chance of success.
Kits are great because they give you a chance to see what’s involved in the process. But once you’ve tried a kit, it can be more fun to experiment with spawn and substrates. Start by researching different mushroom varieties and the types of substrates and growing conditions each requires. Once you decide on a mushroom variety, look online for spawn suppliers.
Using your own substrates is part of the fun, and it’s a money-saver. Most substrates do need to be pasteurized before use to kill off harmful bacteria and fungi, but the process is fairly simple. Common methods include baths in hot water, hydrogen peroxide or lime, and cold incubation.
Cardboard is an exception. Since most other fungi and bacteria won’t grow on cardboard, it doesn’t need to be pasteurized before use. Simply tear waste cardboard into small pieces and soak in water for at least an hour. Once it’s drained, it’s ready to use.
Cultivating mushroom spores so that you can bypass spawn suppliers is, unfortunately, labor-intensive and costly. It requires a sterile workplace, as well as a pressure cooker or autoclave. However, if you become an avid mushroom producer, you might want to look into cultivating your own spores, too.
If you’re not using a kit, prepare the substrate, and then inoculate it with spawn.
Place the inoculated substrate in the best possible environment for the variety. Most mushrooms grow best if the temperature is around 55-60 degrees Fahrenheit, but some varieties will perform better in temperatures that are slightly cooler or warmer. Some light is OK, but keep the substrate away from direct sunlight. Basements often work well for growing mushrooms, as does the space under your kitchen sink.
Keep the inoculated substrate moist by covering it with a damp cloth or a sheet of plastic that has some holes punched in it for air circulation. Remove the covering and spritz with non-chlorinated water two to three times a day.
Depending on the variety chosen, the quality of the spawn, and the suitability of the growing environment, tiny mushrooms may begin growing within a few days to a few weeks. This process is called “pinning.”
Once your mushrooms begin pinning, they will mature quickly, usually within a few days.
The method of harvesting your mushroom depends on the variety you are growing. Some should be cut at the stem; others should be broken off in clumps.
And that’s it! Who knew it could be so easy to grow mushrooms? It really isn’t all that different from growing vegetables, except you are using spawn instead of seeds, and darkness instead of light. Because they prefer cool, dark environments, and require only a little bit of space, mushrooms are the perfect indoor winter crop.

Baking soda has many uses and its popularity has increased with revealing its healing properties. Among many other things, it can be used for hair quality improvement. It won’t just clean the hair from conditioner or cleanser remains but it will also make it look shinier as it has never been.
Use a heating pop instead of usual cleanser as it is more beneficial for the hair. Try the following baking soda treatment if you want to avoid the products that are filled with harmful chemicals and to maintain the health of your hair and skin. The results will amaze you.
Make a mixture of three parts of water and one part of baking soda in small squeeze bottle. After that, apply the mixture to dry or wet hair and massage it well. Leave it for 1-3 minutes and rinse well. Use warm water to clean the hair from any remains. After you rinse the hair, apply vinegar rinse. Make it of four parts water and one part of apple cider vinegar. You can also add few drops of rosemary, peppermint or/and lavender essential oil so the vinegar smell will be suppressed. Rinse the entire hair with it.
It may be difficult to wash the hair with it as it does not have the foam as the regular shampoos but after you see the results you will change your opinion.

"Aging is inevitable, and it leads to numerous changes in our appearance, hair, skin, joints, melanin, eyesight, and the entire body in general.
However, there are numerous natural foods which can help us slow down the aging process and reduce its effects. Today, we will reveal 12 foods which enhance the eyesight and stop its loss.
Our ability to see things close and at a distance is affected by the length and the shape of the eyeballs, as well as the thickness of the eye lens. Moreover, vision is also affected by the light-sensitive cells in the retina, which is located at the back of the eyes.
“Lutein and zeaxanthin are found commonly in dark green leafy vegs such as kale and spinach, and also bell peppers, corn, and saffron. Meso-zeaxanthin is generally not found in plants — it is thought to be made in our bodies from lutein (although it is also present in some fish … ) These pigments, once we eat them, appear to be important in our vision and in helping keep the macula healthy.”
Hence, the consumption of Lutein and Zeaxanthin is of high importance for the eyesight. These ingredients are rich in nutrients which are beneficial for our vision.
“The results of my tests were both fascinating and depressing. My detection of yellow and blue colors was extremely poor — something that [Professor John] Barbur said was likely the result of my brush with diabetes many years ago.
My night vision and perception of details were also poor compared with younger people — but consistent with my age. The Trust Me team then handed me a 90-day supply of supplement pills that were supposed to help.”
After 3 months of consumption, lutein, and zeaxanthin drastically improve the eyesight.
Studies have shown that the daily intake of 10 milligrams of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin normalize vision and treat all vision issues.
“Should we all, then, be taking supplements to protect and even improve our eyesight? Well, the research certainly shows that supplements work.
Even for someone like me, who has a relatively healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, and whose blood levels of the compounds that weren’t particularly low, the supplements helped. However, some researchers believe that diet can simply be enough if we eat the right things.”
These nutrients can be found in high levels in green leafy vegetables, such as kale and spinach. The results of another study also confirmed this, and authors stated:
“Most of the dark green leafy vegetables, previously recommended for a higher intake of lutein and zeaxanthin, have 15 [to] 47 percent of lutein, but a very low content (0 to 3 percent) of zeaxanthin.
You can also consume egg yolk which presents a good source of these nutrients. SO it will improve the eye health too.”
The bright orange yolks of the eggs from free-range, pastured hens, indicate that they are high in lutein and zeaxanthin content. On the other hand, pale yellow yolks are obtained from caged hens fed with unnatural foods, and they are low in these.
A recent study has also shown that the regular consumption of vitamin C prevents cataracts, which are ones of the main causes of vision loss. Therefore, eat citrus fruits, including limes, lemons, and oranges in order to raise the vitamin C levels in the body.
Acerola cherries are especially beneficial, so make sure you consume them often. Each cherry contains 80 mg of this vitamin, numerous micronutrients, and only one calorie.
Moreover, make sure you consume omega 3 fats to prevent blindness. Researchers have found that these fats are found in highest doses in fish.
We recommend the following marine sources rich in omega-3 and low in environmental pollutants:
* Wild Alaskan salmon (which is also high in astaxanthin — a powerful promoter of eye health)
Bilberry is excellent for the eyesight as well, and experts advise the following:
“When looking for a bilberry supplement for the eye, choose one that also includes 10 to 20 mg lutein and 1 to 2 mg zeaxanthin. Patients should target 80 to 160 mg daily. Those seeking prevention of eye disease, or just protection of the cells, can target 40 to 80 mg daily in combination with other antioxidant vitamins or in fruit combinations, such as blueberry/bilberry/raspberry.”
Additionally, it is of high importance to prevent damage to the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA — which is an essential animal-based omega-3 fat) in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), as its role is to convert photons from sunlight into electrons.
This is done via the photoelectric effect which was the reason Einstein received a Nobel prize in 1921. These electrons provide a DC electric current which is vital for the proper functioning of the body.
Make sure you consume healthy foods, and lead a healthy lifestyle in order to support overall health, and thus enhance the eyesight as well.",1
"Whether you want to drop that last ten pounds or simply maintain the weight you’re at, utilizing coconut oil in your diet can help you lose weight.
Not so long ago coconut oil was not favored by health advocates due to its high saturated fat content, but it has since been deemed healthier and in fact, can successfully help people shed a few pounds over time.
Coconut oil may be comprised of 90% saturated fat, but scientists state that its fat is largely made up of lauric acid, which is a medium-chain saturated fatty acid (MCT) that actually has a better effect on the heart than the other saturated fats.
Therefore, you have permission to add coconut oil into your diet in order to promote health and possibly lose a few pounds as well.
Backing up these claims are reports from countries like India and the Philippines, whose diets prominently feature coconuts and coconut products. Citizens from such countries tend to have less weight issues and have minimal rates of cardiac diseases as compared to individuals from the developed world.
When it comes to weight loss, metabolism is a big deal, so the faster you can get your metabolism going, the more calories your body will burn.
Coconut oil is considered “thermogenic”, which essentially means that when you eat it, it tends to increase the amount of fat burning going on in your body more so than the other oils that you could be consuming.
In fact, one study of participants taking 1 to 2 tablespoons of medium chain fats (found in coconut oil), burned an extra 120 calories per day. This is good news for those who are counting calories in order to lose weight.
In another study, 31 overweight men and women who were trying to lose weight were given a spoonful of coconut or olive oil each day for four months to see what oil, if any, would help with weight loss. The women consumed a bit over 1 tablespoon and the men consumed about two tablespoons.
The study revealed that after four months, those who consumed the coconut oil lost an average of 7 pounds, but those who consumed olive oil lost only 3 pounds. The scientists believed that the difference was that the metabolism of those who consumed the coconut oil increased much more than those who consumed olive oil.
There are other foods that can boost your metabolism and you can have a look at them in my article top 10 foods to boost your metabolism. If you are really serious about boosting your metabolism you should also be aware of these 10 factors that affect your metabolism.
How to Use Coconut Oil for Weight Loss
There are essentially two types of coconut oil — virgin and refined.
* Virgin coconut oil (VCO), is made by pressing fresh coconut meat, milk or milk residue.
* Refined, or RBD, oil is made from the coconut copra or dried kernel and may be chemically treated.
Choose virgin coconut oil because it is prepared with no chemicals in the process.
In order to help you lose some weight, coconut oil can be used in several ways in the kitchen. These include:
With nuts being so healthy for your body, consider preparing nut butter for good health and weight loss. To prepare this, grind two cups of cashews or almonds with two tablespoons of coconut oil until the mixture is smooth and buttery. You can throw in some honey, ground coffee, cinnamon, or maple syrup to add more flavor. Feel free to use nut butter on toast, English muffins, or bagels for a delicious and healthy breakfast.
Nuts have amazing health benefits – I’ve already written a post about the health benefits of nuts (including delicious recipes).
Since coconut oil can be used under high temperatures, you can use it to replace butter when baking foods like cookies, muffins, cakes, and brownies. Coconut oil can be used to substitute other oils (as well as butter) in nearly all baking recipes. To bake with coconut oil, replace your other oil by using a 1:1 ratio.
Vegetables like zucchini, beets, sweet potatoes, and butternut squash can be brushed with a mixture of thyme, lemon juice, coconut oil, salt and paper to give them a desirable coconut flavor. Go ahead and sauté them using coconut oil or brush them with it and cook them on the grill. There’s nothing like grilled vegetables!
Coconut oil is known to nicely pop corn kernels when it is used instead of normal vegetable fat. Hold off on the butter to maximize your weight loss regimen.
You can add coconut oil to your smoothies or other beverages, such as your morning coffee.
You might reach for your jar of coconut oil and see that it has solidified. This is because coconut oil usually solidifies at 76 degrees Fahrenheit. It is completely safe to use coconut oil in its solid state but if you want to use coconut oil to replace you normal oil, you can dip the jar into a hot water bath before using it.
The best time to consume coconut oil is about a half an hour before mealtimes, as coconut oil has satiating effects that makes you feel fuller, thus helping in weight loss.
If you want to consume coconut oil by the tablespoon, the recommendation is to take up to 3 tablespoons daily per adult.
What About the Calories
It is important to be aware that coconut oil is fat – it contains 9 calories per gram. Therefore if you consume a fixed amount of calories, you need to take into consideration the added calorie intake of the coconut oil. But, most people don’t count calories and in these cases, adding coconut oil to your diet will reduce your appetite and probably make you eat less of other foods instead.
Instead of adding coconut oil on top of your other cooking fats, try to replace some of your other cooking fats with coconut oil.

"I’m not a proponent of dessert for breakfast but I do love to eat breakfast with a dessert appeal to it. Today I’m sharing with you a Granola Crusted Yogurt Fruit Tart which takes a classic yogurt parfait and deconstructs it into a gorgeous breakfast tart that will not only satisfy your sweet tooth, it will start your day with a great balance of nutrients (simple and complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats) to sustain you through the morning.
These tarts are highly adaptable to you liking. You can add different types of add-ins depending on what you like to eat as well as your dietary needs.
The crust is made from granola (without fruit), coconut oil, and a little bit of honey. The granola can be homemade or store-bought. Just be sure to use granola without dried pieces of fruit because we will make granola crumbs in a food processor and dried fruit doesn’t cooperate as well as oats and nuts. Feel free to use a flavored granola like cinnamon, ginger, pumpkin, or cocoa. If you prefer to use homemade granola, here is my favorite granola recipe from the Savory Sweet Life archives. Coconut oil is considered a heart-healthy medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) saturated fat. Unlike other fats, the medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil metabolizes in the body as an energy source and burns as fuel instead of being stored as fat. The honey used in the crust is intended to work more as a binder than it is to sweeten the crust. If you prefer agave or maple syrup, either of these can be substituted. When these three ingredients are thrown into a food processor and pulsated into little tiny grain size pieces, the “crumbs” become the perfect texture to make a nice crunchy hard tart crust that is baked for about 12 minutes. Once cooled, it transforms into a beautiful cookie like, tart shell – durable enough to hold a filling. Tip: Bake the crusts the night before and allow them to cool overnight. This way you have them ready to go in the morning, only taking a few minutes to assemble the entire tart for breakfast.
Instead of a traditional custard or pastry cream filling, this recipe calls for yogurt. Greek yogurt works best because of its creamy thick custard-like texture. I prefer the non-fat plain variety but feel free to use your favorite kind. Two benefits to using plain yogurt is having the freedom to sweeten it to your liking, which for me is a lot less sweeter than most flavored yogurts on the refrigerated store shelves. Plain Greek yogurt also is much higher in protein.
Lastly, each tart should be topped off with fresh ripe fruit. Strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, peaches, mangoes, and bananas work best. To add visual appeal, a pinch of chia seeds, chopped nuts, toasted coconut, and mint leaves can be added along with the fruit. Even a tiny  teaspoon drizzle of honey, agave syrup, or maple syrup can be drizzled over the whole tart for added sweetness, if necessary.
These tarts can be served for breakfast, brunch, or as a healthy after dinner dessert, perfect for Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, birthdays, or any other special occasion.
Tip: Use a flat bottom measuring cup to press the crumbs down firmly to the base and sides.",0

From the moment puberty begins, girls are taught by their mom’s the ins and outs of tampon usage. We’re introduced to the different brands available, how to use the applicator, and most importantly to change our tampon every four hours. We know there is a risk of developing toxic shock syndrome, but understand the risk is rare, so we discard the leaflet that comes with the box, stash a few extra tampons in our purse, and go about our day.
That’s exactly what model and athlete Lauren Wasser did, and it left her without a leg.
Lauren’s Story
In October 2012, Lauren did not feel well, but was on her period and so she chalked it up to menstrual symptoms. By later that evening she was so ill that she could barely stand. After not hearing from her daughter, Lauren’s mother grew concerned and sent the police to her house, where they found Lauren face down on her bedroom floor. She was rushed to the hospital with a fever of 107, had suffered a massive heart attack and her internal organs were shutting down; she was minutes from death. A disease specialist sent her tampon to the lab, which tested positive for Toxic Shock Syndrome.
Lauren was put into a medically induced coma. Her stomach was bloated while she was pumped with liquid to flush out the black toxins running rampant through her body.
“My belly was huge. I had tubes everywhere. I couldn’t speak… It’s the most excruciating pain I’ve ever – I don’t know how to describe it to you.” Lauren told Vice.
Lauren lost her right leg from the knee down from gangrene, a side effect of TSS, as well as the toes on her left foot. She has to have frequent maintenance surgeries, and there is a high probability that Lauren will have to have her right leg amputated later on in life.
“I wanted to kill myself when I got home,” Lauren says of dealing with the psychological aftermath of losing a limb. “It took me a while to figure out if I was still worthy, if I was still pretty.”
She is now an activist working to educate women on the risks of TSS, even with proper tampon use. She hopes to be a catalyst for change in tampon industry, making them safer for women to use.
Toxic Shock Syndrome
Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) is a bacterial infection that results from the toxins produced primarily by Staphylococcus aureus, as well as others such as group A streptococcus bacteria. Though historically it is associated with super absorbent tampons, you must already be infected by the staph bacteria for TSS to develop, so it can be seen in children, men, and post-menopausal women. (1)(2)
Symptoms of TSS
Sudden high fever
Hypotension (low blood pressure)
Sunburn-like rash, particularly on the palms of hand and soles of feet
Vomiting or diarrhea
Confusion
Muscle Aches
Headaches
Redness of eyes, throat, and mouth
Seizures
Thankfully, we have plenty of alternatives to conventional tampons available that are safer to use and often better for the environment than conventional flow-stopping options.
5 Alternatives to Conventional Tampons Organic/Natural Pads and Tampons
This is the obvious, no-brainer one. Choosing natural, organic cotton tampons means avoiding the plastics and rayons in traditional brands that are a breeding ground for bad bacteria. Using pads instead of tampons poses no risk of developing TSS.
The downside to pads? They produce a ton of waste, can’t be worn while swimming, and can be downright uncomfortable – any woman who has ever worn a pad on a hot summer day can attest to this one. Be sure to choose organic, as cotton is considered one of the dirtiest crops in the world for pesticide and insecticide use. (3)
Menstrual Cups
These are reusable, soft-sided cups that fit inside the vagina. The most popular brand is the Divacup, and women who use them swear by them. They are fantastic for the environment and your wallet, needing only to be replaced about once a year. Menstrual cups provide twelve-hour protection from leaks and odors and are easy to insert, once you get the hang of it. (4)
Cloth Pads
Made with a waterproof liner to prevent blood from leaking onto your clothing, cloth pads are safe and reliable. They are reusable, but require washing. Some brands have the option of changing just an insert instead of the whole pad, however, there is the hurdle of what to do with the used pad while going about your day. After all, there isn’t exactly a good place to store used pads at the office.
Sea Sponge
A sea sponge is just as it sounds – a porous sponge that grows in the ocean. It’s a renewable resource that can last up to six months and conforms to the shape of your vagina. You have to clean it before your first use to be sure no sand or sea remnants remain, and they are messy to remove. (5)
Period Panties
Underwear designed to replace panty liners, period panties come in thong, cheeky, and hip hugger. Some brands are only meant as backup to replace a panty liner, and some are designed for heavier flow. They boast allowing you peace of mind, as they never slip like traditional liners, however you have to rinse them before washing to prevent blood from staining the rest of your laundry. (6)

Drink some before you hit the pillow or as soon as you wake up to stave off drinking’s aftermath. In some bars, you can even order a “pickleback” shot to follow your regular round of spirits. Be proactive!
Kills Weeds
Spray or pour the juice directly onto weeds to get rid of them. The mix of vinegar and salt is what does it.
Pickle Anything
It’s true. You can reuse the juice to pickle other foods. Just dump some carrots, eggs, peppers or whatever you’d like into the jar and let it brine for a few days.
Deviled Eggs
For an added punch to your deviled eggs recipe, add about a tablespoon of dill pickle juice to your mashed yolks.
Upset Stomach
A sour stomach can be tamed with the neutralizing power of pickle juice. It’s great for stomach bugs as well as morning sickness. Try it!
Workout Drink
If you don’t believe this one, look it up. Pro and amateur athletes swear by pickle juice as a reliable pre-and-post-workout drink. Due to its electrolyte content, you stay hydrated and what you sweat out is restored. Oh, and bottled workout pickle juice drinks are really a thing, too. Check your local grocer!
Muscle Cramps
It’s been verified by science that pickle juice stops muscle cramps in their tracks. Sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium chloride fight cramping. Because of that and its electrolytes, jars of this stuff line practice benches all over. It’s the drink of choice for sports players, and coaches cosign on it.
Sunburn Soother
To soothe your sun-cooked skin, blot it with pickle juice. The vinegar in it helps to take the sting out of the burn and calm any blistering. Hold a pickle on especially sore spots to find relief. It’s good for kids too!
PMS Relief
Those cramps and cravings that we all look forward to can be wiped out with a swig or four of pickled brine. Seriously, drink at least  cup of this in the days leading up to and the first day of your cycle and notice the difference.
Antioxidants
Vitamin C and vitamin E are rich in pickle juice, as are other antioxidants, fighting free radicals and helping the immune system protect the body against diseases like cancer.
Sore Throat
The germ fighting benefits of salt and vinegar in the juice are an effective remedy for sore throats. If you or your kids are not keen on drinking it, you can gargle with it instead.
Heartburn & Indigestion
Either sip on a glass of pickle juice or munch on a crunchy dill to balance the stomach’s pH levels. Some people have ditched antacids altogether and go the way of the pickle every time. No more pain or discomfort!
Clean Copper
Scrub char off your copper cookware with pickle juice. You can soak the bottoms of your pans in a bowl of the stuff or use it for scrubbing.
Weight Loss
The vinegar in the green juice is a metabolism booster and overall it’s low in calories, making it a viable option for helping to meet weight loss goals. Just be careful that the sodium levels don’t make you retain water instead.
Cocktail Addition
While creative mixologists have come up with pickle-centric cocktails that highlight the juice, simply adding a splash of it to your martini or Bloody Mary will be your drink’s best kept secret. Bottoms up!
Melt Ice
A little known fact is that the calcium chloride in pickle brine can melt ice. Ice trucks in New Jersey and Pennsylvania use it to deice city streets in the winter. The next time your driveway and sidewalk gets slippery, reach for a jar.
Marinade
Pickle juice can be used to marinate and tenderize meats, and is a lovely accompaniment to poached fish. Use it as an overnight marinade for chicken to give it a nice flavor when you grill or fry it!",1
"(Before It's News)Jupiter’s intense northern and southern lights, or auroras, behave independently of each other according to a new study using NASA’s Chandra X-ray and ESA’s XMM-Newton observatories.
Using XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observations from March 2007 and May and June 2016, a team of researchers produced maps of Jupiter’s X-ray emissions (shown in inset) and identified an X-ray hot spot at each pole. Each hot spot can cover an area equal to about half the surface of the Earth.
The team found that the hot spots had very different characteristics. The X-ray emission at Jupiter’s south pole consistently pulsed every 11 minutes, but the X-rays seen from the north pole were erratic, increasing and decreasing in brightness — seemingly independent of the emission from the south pole.
(Before It's News)Jupiter’s intense northern and southern lights, or auroras, behave independently of each other according to a new study using NASA’s Chandra X-ray and ESA’s XMM-Newton observatories.
Using XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observations from March 2007 and May and June 2016, a team of researchers produced maps of Jupiter’s X-ray emissions (shown in inset) and identified an X-ray hot spot at each pole. Each hot spot can cover an area equal to about half the surface of the Earth.
The team found that the hot spots had very different characteristics. The X-ray emission at Jupiter’s south pole consistently pulsed every 11 minutes, but the X-rays seen from the north pole were erratic, increasing and decreasing in brightness — seemingly independent of the emission from the south pole.
This makes Jupiter particularly puzzling. X-ray auroras have never been detected from our Solar System’s other gas giants, including Saturn. Jupiter is also unlike Earth, where the auroras on our planet’s north and south poles generally mirror each other because the magnetic fields are similar.
To understand how Jupiter produces its X-ray auroras, the team of researchers plans to combine new and upcoming X-ray data from Chandra and XMM-Newton with information from NASA’s Juno mission, which is currently in orbit around the planet. If scientists can connect the X-ray activity with physical changes observed simultaneously with Juno, they may be able to determine the process that generates the Jovian auroras and by association X-ray auroras at other planets.
One theory that the X-ray and Juno observations may help to prove or disprove is that Jupiter’s X-ray auroras are caused by interactions at the boundary between Jupiter’s magnetic field, which is generated by electrical currents in the planet’s interior, and the solar wind, a high-speed flow of particles streaming from the Sun. The interactions between the solar wind and Jupiter’s magnetic field can cause the latter to vibrate and produce magnetic waves. Charged particles can surf these waves and gain energy. Collisions of these particles with Jupiter’s atmosphere produce the bright flashes of X-rays observed by Chandra and XMM. Within this theory the 11-minute interval would represent the time for a wave to travel along one of Jupiter’s magnetic field lines.
The difference in behavior between the Jovian north and south poles may be caused by the difference in visibility of the two poles. Because the magnetic field of Jupiter is tilted, we are able to see much more of the northern aurora than the southern aurora. Therefore for the north pole we may be able to observe regions where the magnetic field connects to more than one location, with several different travel times, while for the south pole we can only observe regions where the magnetic field connects to one location. This would cause the behavior of the north pole to appear erratic compared to the south pole.
A larger question is how does Jupiter give the particles in its magnetosphere (the realm controlled by Jupiter’s magnetic field) the huge energies needed to make X-rays? Some of the X-ray emission observed with Chandra can only be produced if Jupiter accelerates oxygen ions to such high energies that when they violently collide with the atmosphere all eight of their electrons are torn off. Scientists hope to determine what impact these particles, which crash into the planet’s poles at thousands of kilometers per second, have on the planet itself. Do these high-energy particles affect the Jovian weather and the chemical composition of its atmosphere? Can they explain the anomalously high temperatures found in certain places in Jupiter’s atmosphere? These are the questions that Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Juno may be able to help answer in the future.
Apaper describing these resultsappeared in the October 30th issue of Nature Astronomy, led by William Dunn of the University College London. NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, manages the Chandra program for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, controls Chandra’s science and flight operations.",1

The thyroid is an endocrine gland located in the neck. It secretes two hormones into the blood, such as triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Moreover, these thyroid hormones are responsible for regulating the energy, metabolism and growth.
But, thyroid disorders are quite common nowadays. It has been estimated that 1 out of 20 people is prone to experience some type of thyroid disorder during their life.  However, these disorders typically occur in women. Also, they may occur in men, children, and teenagers.
Types of Thyroid Disorders:
Hyperthyroidism
Hypothyroidism
They both are caused by thyroid hormone imbalance. In short, in case the thyroid gland produces excess or very low amount of the thyroid hormone, you can experience hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.
Specifically, hyperthyroidism is a common thyroid disorder, which occurs if the thyroid produces too much of this hormone. The most common symptoms of this condition include irritation, nervousness, anxiety, a rapid heart rate, diarrhea, sudden weight loss, heat sensitivity, and sleep disorders.
Hypothyroidism occurs in case the thyroid does not produce enough of this hormone. Additionally, the most common symptoms of the condition include fatigue, dry skin, weight gain, muscle pain, cramps, concentration difficulties, hair thinning, excess fluid in tissues, and cold sensitivity.
What’s more, if the thyroid gland starts functioning very hard, then it may lead to a large lump formation in the throat. Furthermore, it is a symptom of iodine deficiency, which is known as goitre.
READ THE FULL POST ON NEXT PAGE Here Are the Main Culprits of Thyroid Disorders:
Chronic stress
Toxin overload
Iodine deficiency
Metal buildup
That’s not all, hyperthyroidism can be also triggered by the following conditions: Graves’ sickness, thyroiditis, or toxic adenomas.
On the other hand, hypothyroidism could be also caused by lithium or iodine overexposure, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, or thyroid removal.
How to Prevent and Treat Your Thyroid Disorder Naturally: – Eat Healthy
Proper nutrition plays a major role in treating thyroid problems. So, it is advisable to lower your intake of refined flours, processed and sugary foods, and elevate your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, iodine, selenium, and zinc to support good thyroid health.
– Manage Your Stress
Chronic stress results in adrenal exhaustion, thus increasing your risk of developing thyroid disorders. Hence, consider engaging in certain stress management programs and relaxing activities, such as breathing exercises, yoga, meditation, walks in nature, etc. These activities can lower your tension as well as promote calmness and a general sense of well-being.
– Exercise Regularly
You can promote excellent function of your thyroid gland by exercising on a regular basis. In this way, you can promote optimal production of this hormone.
– Detoxify Your Body
You can also use sauna session or a heat therapy to treat your thyroid disorder because they can remove any harmful toxins and detoxify your body.
– Take High-Quality Nutritional Supplements
Prior to taking any nutritional supplement, consider consulting a physician or nutritionist. But, there are many powerful nutritional supplements that can help in the treatment of any thyroid problem.
– Use Thyroid Hormone Replacement Therapy
You should also ask your doctor about some thyroid hormone replacement therapy because it may help prevent or treat these disorders.
– Prevent the Underlying Causes of Thyroid Problems
You can prevent any thyroid disorder by preventing the root causes of the issue. So, it is advisable to manage stress, and treat nutritional deficiencies, allergies, and cleanse your body from toxins and heavy metals. Also, reduce your consumption of gluten and dairy products in order to prevent digestive distress.

"A line of credit is a combination of a conventional loan and credit card. A personal line of credit is a unique credit service provided to meet financial needs, also known as revolving credit is offered by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and other lenders. A line of credit is of great use when you require funds in dire needs. There are times when you are suffering from a financial crunch, in these tough patches, a line of credit helps in a great way to fulfil financial needs. There are certain unpredicted events such as automobile repairs, major medical expense, and so on where in you need urgent cash. In such a case, a personal line of credit is the best option.
When it comes to availing a line of credit, there are diverse Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) which are leading this credit segment. Under a line of credit provision, you are provided with a specific amount, and as soon as the amount is assigned, you can withdraw and use the money flexibly. However, it is important to make sure that there is a prescribed limit within which you can use the funds. Apart from this, there are several benefits which make a line of credit the most favourable option:
Low-Interest Rates: The interest rates on personal line of credit is the most favourable one. Unlike the other forms of loan, wherein you have to start paying the rate of interest on the principal amount regardless of how much you use. However, under the line of credit, you are required to pay rate of interest only on the amount that you use and not what you withdraw.
Lower Instalments: A line of credit instalment is pretty convenient as compared to a conventional loan and that is because the repayment depends upon the usage. Since you are entitled to repay the amount only when you use it, the instalment under the line of credit is considerably lower. Flexibility: A line of credit offers flexibility. You are free to choose the amount you want to withdraw along with the repayment plan. However, the repayment period lies between 24-60 months. i.e. 2 to 5 years.
No Collateral: One of the biggest benefits of a line of credit is that you do not need to submit a collateral when availing it. Furthermore, you do not require to submit the proof of your assets. This makes a line of credit one of the most attractive credit avenues. No Hidden Costs: A line of credit service is straightforward. You do not have to pay any charges or fees on the amount you withdraw. Furthermore, there are no withdrawal limits. Thus, you can withdraw as many times as you wish.
The personal line of credit offered by highly certified NBFCs is up to INR 25 lakhs. When you are looking forward to availing a personal line of credit, it is essential that you approach NBFCs as they are more flexible with their plans and policies when compared to banks.",1
"HOLDING a gilt to maturity is investing. Betting at the roulette wheel is gambling. Between these two extremes, the distinction between the two is less clear. Some of the websites offering “binary options” are accused of taking advantage of this confusion.
Binary-options sites allow users to bet on the future value of assets including stocks, commodities and currencies. A person could predict that the price of oil will be above $53 in ten minutes’ time. If correct, they might receive a payout almost double the initial stake. If wrong, they could lose most or all of the wager.
The use of financial terminology and assets may lead customers to think they are investing. But the high-risk, high-reward nature of short-term predictions gives them an experience closer to online gambling. Economic theory suggests that asset prices fluctuate randomly in the short run, absent any new information. For most customers, success will be a matter of chance. Like casino games, many binary options are structured in such a way that, if outcomes are random, customers will lose money on average.
Confusion over the nature of binary options has made them difficult to regulate. In Britain, trading them is considered gambling, so it is not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The Gambling Commission regulates binary-options providers whose “gambling equipment”—in this case, computers—is in the country. But firms registered in other European Union jurisdictions can operate in Britain without the Gambling Commission’s oversight. Some EU-registered firms, which often have most of their assets and employees outside the EU, are said to take advantage of this lack of oversight to commit fraud.
The City of London Police conducted a “day of action” on October 17th in which they gathered information from companies operating in the square mile. Officers say that 2,065 people have reported being a victim of binary-options fraud since 2012, with average losses of 22,811 ($30,250). Scams include refusing to pay those who make correct predictions and making it difficult for them to transfer their winnings off the site.
Other jurisdictions have taken action against such sites. Last month the sale of binary options with deadlines shorter than 30 days was banned in most of Canada. In Israel, where many binary-options firms have set up to sell to foreigners, the Knesset passed a law on October 23rd to ban the industry.
Change is also coming to Britain. In January the FCA will assume oversight of binary options when Britain adopts the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, an EU-wide reform of financial regulation that is better known as MiFID 2. Until then, binary-options traders should be wary, whether they consider themselves investors or gamblers.",0
"My suggestion: If you have messenger on your phone delete it. Then re-download it and read the terms of agreement. This is sheer lunacy. Also for those who didn’t know this one, check out this video. This news is actually about 5-7 years old.
Notice what the government has made cell phone makers do now? Notice you can’t take the battery out? Cellphone users who attempt to install the Facebook Messenger app are asked to agree to terms of service that allow the social networking giant to use the microphone on their device to record audio at any time without their permission. As the screenshot below illustrates (click to enlarge), users are made to accept an agreement that allows Facebook to “record audio with the microphone… at any time without your confirmation.”
The TOS also authorizes Facebook to take videos and pictures using the phone’s camera at any time without permission, as well as directly calling numbers, again without permission, that could incur charges. But wait, there’s more! Facebook can also “read your phone’s call log” and “read data about contacts stored on your phone, including the frequency with which you’ve called, emailed or communicated in other ways with specific individuals.”
Although most apps on Android and Apple devices include similar terms to those pictured above, this is easily the most privacy-busting set of mandates we’ve seen so far. Since the vast majority of people will agree to these terms without even reading them, cellphone users are agreeing to let Facebook monitor them 24/7, green lighting the kind of open ended wiretap that would make even the NSA jealous. Other app companies are also requiring you to allow them to approximate your location, send SMS messages from your phone that cost you money, read your contacts, read your phone status and identity, get “full network access” to your communications (in other words listen to your phone calls), modify or delete the contents of your USB storage, and disable your screen lock (the 4 digit code that password-protects your phone).
As we have previously highlighted, embedded microphones in everything from Xbox Kinect consoles to high-tech street lights that can record private conversations in real time represent the final nail in the coffin of privacy as the ‘Internet of things’ becomes a part of our daily lives….",1
"Raleigh, NC — At a press conference today,North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory took further steps to ensure that his controversial bill, HB2, will be upheld when it comes to law enforcement. McCrory announced that his office has setup a 24-hour hotline for individuals to call if they witness someone not abiding by the new law.
“If you see a woman, who doesn’t look like a woman, using the woman’s restroom, be vigilant, call the hotline, and report that individual.” McCrory told reporters. “We need our state to unite as one if we’re going to keep our children safe from all the sexual predators and otheraberrant behavior that is out there.”
Tom Downey, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office, explained the new hotline to reporters.
“Beginning today, individuals that notice any kind of gender-suspicious activity in the men’s or women’s restrooms are encouraged to call the new ‘HB2 Offender Hotline’,” Horner said. “We encourage North Carolina’s residents to take photographs and report as much detail as possible when calling. With the information gathered from this hotline, we’ll be working closely with local law enforcement agencies to make sure this law is enforced and those who break the law see jail bars. We are sending a clear message to all the transsexuals out there; their illegal actions and deviant behavior will no longer be tolerated in the state of North Carolina.”
“I applaud HB2, the offender hotline they setup and Governor Pat McCrory,” North Carolina resident Steve Jenkins told local news station WTVD. “As a man, how would some women like it if I followed her into the restroom and just told her that everything is OK because I’m transgender? She wouldn’t like it at all, and that’s why you need a law like HB2.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News HB2 and the new hotline make no sense.
“In the history of North Carolina, not one sexually related criminal act has happened in a bathroom by someone who is transgender. No arrests, no convictions, but they still want to make laws, just in case that “one time” ever happens. It’s like making laws outlawing marijuana in the event that someone actually ever dies from it,” Bradley said. “There were plenty of laws already in place before HB2. It doesn’t matter if you’re a man, woman, transgender, or what bathroom you use; if you’re in there longer than 5 minutes after using the restroom, someone is going to call the cops. This new law is about people living in fear, gathering together around their weird ideologies and religious beliefs to create more intolerance and hate in this world, bottom line.”
“I don’t want my money, my taxes going towards anything that discriminates against anyone, especially in public bathrooms,” said North Carolina resident, Steven Hamilton. “I don’t care what a private individual or business does and how hate-filled they want to be, because I can protest and show as much discontent towards them as I want to, but when it comes to my money, those places better be free for all to use, no matter what sexual identity a person may identify with.” Hamilton continued, “Also, I have an eight-year-old daughter who I don’t like using the restroom by herself. What am I supposed to do now? Take her into the women’s bathroom and hope I don’t get arrested or take her with me into the men’s restroom and hope the cops don’t get called? And what if the cops show up and I don’t have my birth certificate on me? Would I actually go to jail? All of this is completely insane.”
Since Governor Pat McCrory signed HB2 into law last month, well over 1,000 jobs have been moved out of state, and over 400 companies, including Facebook, Apple, Paypal, Pyramid Country and StopPack, have expressed concern or anger, warning they may move or cancel plans to expand, costing the state millions of dollars. Entertainers such as Pearl Jam, Ringo Starr, Bryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen and Cirque du Soleil have also canceled their performances in North Carolina to boycott the law. Pressure has been put on the NBA to cancel the All-Star game in North Carolina next year, though as of yet, the league is not budging. It is still unclear what kind of an economic impact these boycotts will have on the state’s economy as a whole. NBC estimates that North Carolina has lost $186 million in revenue due to boycotts so far.
To report suspicious bathroom activity, North Carolina residents can call the ‘HB2 Offender Hotline’ at 1-800-662-7952. For individuals living outside of North Carolina, please call (919) 814-2000. To file a complaint after normal business hours, call (919) 814-2050 and press option 3.",1
"Drinking on the beach is one of life’s many joys, but it’s not always easy to pull off. In most cases, you’refar from the conveniences of civilization, such as running water and refrigeration. Plus, it’s easy to make mistakes—have you ever tried to bringbubbly and ended up with lukewarm fizz?
After years of experience both bartending and beach-drinking, I’ve started using a technique lifted straight out of the professional’s playbook: batching. In my years of working in cocktail bars and restaurants in New York City, we usually prepare for an offsite event, such as a charity dinner, by bringing the non-alcoholic ingredients pre-measured to the location.Like the beach, access to traditional kitchen facilities at these places is often nonexistent.
All you’ll need isa 1-liter (roughly 32-ounce) stainless-steel water bottle or larger, and if it’s insulated, that’s even better. Avoid plastic bottles, whichabsorbflavors. But your S’wellwill work just fine, and another favorite, the Seattle-based Miir, has a 42-ounce model in case you want to scale up the recipes.
Remember to go easy on the alcohol—make the drinks slightly less strong than a “normal” cocktail, and don’t skip the water in these recipes. For some people, it can be too easy to drink too much on the hot beach, and the combination of the sun and heat with a lack of access to fresh watercan lead to an unpleasant post-beach evening.
Once I’m done mixing,I like to leave mine in the freezer overnight. Just make sure there is enough space in the bottle to accommodate any expansion due to freezing. They should be icy or slushy when you pull them out to pack them in the morning, which means they’ll be perfect by the time you get to your favorite spot in the sand.Final pro tip: Wrap the bottles in towels for better insulation. Just make sure the bottles are closed tight.Oh, and always check your local open-container laws before serving.
This drink is nothing more than a gussied-up spiked limeade. Crisp, refreshing citrus-y drinks like this are always a big hit in the sand. You can also riff and modify as you see fit, switch the spirit to ginor rum, or even replace altogether with green tea if alcohol’s not your thing.
To make the mint syrup, combine 1 cup water and 1 cup granulated sugar with 10 to15 fresh mint leaves in a blender. Blend on high for 2 minutes and strain with a fine-mesh strainer. You can mix the herbs, too, and use basil, rosemary, or different mint varieties. Once that is made, combine all ingredients and pour into a metal water bottle like the HydroFlaskabove. One big thing to keep in mind is to use freshly squeezed lime juice—using prebottled juice is one of the worst crimes against cocktails you can commit. Place in freezer for at least 5 hours, or overnight. Serve with or without ice. Serves 5 to6 people.
Strawberries are the defining flavor of summer, and this whiskey sour riff pairs them with a spicy-and-sweet bourbon that’s perfect for a hot summer day. When making this, be sure to use the ripest berries possible for the best balance. I recommend skipping the step of straining the berries after blending because it gives the drink gives a great texture, like a classier version of a frozen strawberry daiquiri.
To make the simple syrup, combine 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water in a saucepan and bring to a boil, then stir until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and allow to cool before using. Thencombine strawberries and simple syrup in a blender and blend on high for 1 minute. Strain into a container if you want a smooth texture;skip it if you want a chunkier vibe. Combine all ingredients in a metal water bottle like the durable Avexsteel water bottle, which can holdliquids cold for up to 29 hours.Place in freezer for at least 5 hours or overnight. Serve with or without ice. Serves 5 to6 people.
Most people like their Martinis “dry,” which is a shame, because good-quality vermouth is a real treat, especially when it’s fresh and served properly. My riff on the martini is decidedly “wet”—fitting for the beach—and can satisfy those craving a spirit-forward drink without the high risk of overindulgence, since vermouth has less than half the alcohol of such spirits as gin or vodka. If you choose to include olives, they will gently infuse into your drink while they chill, making it a subtly dirty martini.
Combine all ingredients in a container, stir, and pour into a metal water bottle. For a martini, you’ll want something that keeps it ice cold, such as theKleanKanteen, one of my personal favorites.Place in freezer for at least 5 hours or overnight. Serve with or without ice. Serves 5 to6 people.",0
"In the world of Facebook, relationship status comes in a few flavors: ""married"" and ""divorced,"" ""single"" and ""it's complicated."" When it comes to science, relationship status has its own varieties: love and hate, comprehension and confusion.
Some of these relationships reflect values and emotions, while others are epistemic: They reflect what we know or understand about science.
What's the relationship to science that we should be aiming to achieve? And why does it matter?
International assessments reliably find that the U. S. lags behind many other countries when it comes to scientific literacy, and a variety of efforts aim to improve what's referred to as ""public understanding of science."" While some of these efforts focus on assessing and improving people's attitudes towards science, the educational world is typically more concerned with imparting knowledge and understanding.
But spelling out what these epistemic relationships entail isn't entirely straightforward. What does it mean to understand evolution, or photosynthesis, or climate change? And what does understanding buy us that mere knowledge does not?
A new paper, forthcoming in the journal Public Understanding of Science, argues that research on the public's understanding of science often conflates knowledge and understanding, and that this conflation has costs. As researcher Joanna Huxster and her co-authors conclude: ""We want students who are not just well informed, but capable."" That means being able to work with information to draw new inferences and make good judgments, not just ""knowing"" key claims.
Huxster's paper, a unique collaboration between philosophers, undergraduate students at Bucknell University, and an expert in environmental studies, combines some conceptual analysis with a close look at published papers on public understanding of science.
The first step was defining their terms. Epistemologists argue about the exact nature of knowledge and understanding, but a few commitments are widely shared. One is that knowledge involves true beliefs, at least as a necessary (if not sufficient) condition. I can't know that humans have 30 chromosomes (because it isn't true). And if someone doesn't believe that humans evolved through natural selection, we wouldn't say that she knows it (even though it's true).
A second common set of commitments is that understanding goes beyond knowledge in being more holistic (it requires seeing how different pieces of information fit together) and in being more functional (it requires being able to work with the information in some way). The authors use these common commitments to develop the following baseline definition of understanding:
""One understands a subject (issue, concept, theory, ...) only if one grasps how a constellation of facts relevant to that subject are related to one another (causally, inferentially, explanatorily, etc.) in such a way as to be able to make new connections or draw new inferences with novel information. As a result, the object of understanding is always a body — and never a single piece — of information.""
Besides its concordance with philosophy, this definition fits with what we know from psychology — people believe that understanding requires a greater level of explanatory depth than does knowledge. If someone understands, we expect that person to know more than an isolated fact, and to be able to deploy what they know to answer new questions.
Equipped with this baseline definition of understanding, Huxster and colleagues went on to analyze whether, and how, research on public understanding of science targets understanding as distinct from mere knowledge.
In an initial analysis, the authors scrutinized the 67 papers published in the journal Public Understanding of Science in the year 2014 to see whether and how they used the term ""understanding."" When papers did employ the term (or a close relative, like ""comprehension""), Huxster and colleagues compared the use to the baseline definition above. The results were dramatic: only one paper explicitly defined understanding in a manner consistent with the baseline definition, and only six endorsed it implicitly. The majority (47 papers) were unclear in their usage, while 11 conflated understanding with knowledge, and two endorsed some non-standard definition. This is striking not only because it suggests a departure from the baseline definition (which, after all, could have reasonable variants), but because it reveals little explicit engagement with understanding as distinct from mere knowledge.
In a second analysis, the authors considered how often research papers aimed to measure some epistemic state (such as knowledge or understanding) and, if they did, whether measures of understanding actually mapped onto the baseline definition.
Looking at all papers published in Public Understanding of Science from 2010-2015, they found only 13 papers (out of 350) that purported to measure an epistemic state. Of those, only three claimed to measure understanding, and by Huxster and colleagues' lights, only one of those three clearly succeeded — the others measured something more like knowledge: true beliefs that might be isolated and inert.
One reason that few papers focused on understanding — and that even fewer of these succeeded in doing so — could be because understanding isn't easy to measure. As educators know too well, it's challenging to constructs multiple choice questions that can truly reveal understanding (as opposed to rote memorization or mere ""knowledge""), and it's both difficult and time-consuming to reliably score essays or other forms of assessment.
Another reason that few papers may have focused on understanding, even in a journal with ""understanding' in the title, is because researchers interested in scientific literacy are also interested in knowledge, in beliefs, in general attitudes towards science, and in people's decisions and behaviors — all of which can reflect or contribute to understanding, but might also be of interest in their own right.
So the findings from the paper by Huxster and colleagues shouldn't be taken as a criticism of past research, but as an invitation to think more carefully about different epistemic relationships to science — and why they matter. Should producing scientific understanding be the central goal of science communication?
Huxster and colleagues argue that understanding is a ""more robust epistemic achievement"" than knowledge — it entails an ability to use information, not just to recite it or to recognize it as true. And that could be pretty important when it comes to making decisions related to science: decisions about vaccination, antibiotic use, nutrition, energy usage, and so much more. (If we include social science in the mix, just about all policy decisions can be informed by science.)
Of course, we don't need to have expert levels of understanding to make informed decisions, but we probably do need to understand enough about science to appreciate how and why science is relevant, and enough about a given domain to evaluate what counts as a credible source of information. These kinds of understanding, in particular, might be crucial when it comes to public understanding of science because they're likely to affect our real-world judgments and behaviors.
It's not a coincidence that I started this post with Facebook — one of several social media platforms that has been used to spread Russian propaganda. Combatting fake news is likely to require some changes to technology, but also some changes to its human users. Achieving some scientific understanding — and not just isolated knowledge — might be an important step, creating more robust and critical consumers of public information, at least in some domains.

Rick Perry urges more conversation about the unsettled science of climate change
U. S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry speaks at the media briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C, urging more conversation about climate change, a science he believes is not at all settled. (Getty Images)
During a mediabriefing on energy and climate changeon Wednesday that one reporter dubbed “high energy,” former Texas governor and current Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry got into a conversation with reporters about the current state of our dialogue on climate change.
Ten minutes into the briefing, areporter asked Perry if climate change was real, and if human activity has made it worse. Perry tookthe opportunity to reiterate his stance that the climate is changing, but that the science is not settled, and that we need to have further conversations about it.
“The climate is changing. Man is having an impact on it,” Perry said. “I’ve said that time after time— the idea that we can’t have an intellectual conversation about just what are the actual impacts?”
Perry brought up that former Obama administrationDOE undersecretary and agricultural scientist Steve Koontz also believed that a conversation about climate change, and man’s impact, was an important conversation to have, since he alsodid not believe the science on climate change was settled.
“Why not have a conversation about that? What is the other side, the people who say ‘the science is settled? It’s done. If you don’t believe that, you’re a skeptic, a Luddite,'” Perry said. ” I don’t buy that. This is America. Have a conversation. Let’s come out of the shadows of hiding behind your political statements and let’s talk about it. What’s wrong with that? I can be convinced, but why not let’s talk about it?”
Perry said he believe that the White House should call together a panel of experts to discuss climate change, and man’s effects on it.
“The science isn’t settled yet. I tend to say, OK, let’s have a conversation and get these guys together,” Perry said.
The reporter later asked Perry to clarify his meaning, asking if the former governor believes that there is no more debate needed on whether climate change is real and man is having an effect.
“No,” Perryanswered. “What I said was climate is changing, always has. Man at this particular point in time is having an effect on it. How much effect is what is at debate here. And more importantly, what is the United States going to do about that? Are we going to sign [the Paris] agreement that really doesn’t call anybody to make any changes?”
“Now, can we agree that we ought to have a conversation as a people, intellectually engaged, not screaming at each other, no standing up in the middle of my speeches and calling me a ‘climate denier.’ When the fact is, I just want to have a conversation about this,” Perry said.
Perry was referring to a protester who interrupted Perry’s speech at the Energy Information Administration conference on Tuesday.
As Perry spoke, a woman accusedPerry repeatedly of being a “climate denier,” not allowing him to speak. Eventually, the woman was shouted down by an annoyed crowd, after Perry denied her accusation, andpleaded with her to let him finish.
Protestor interrupts @SecretaryPerry speech at #EIAconf this morning! Asks ""Why are you a climate denier??""

"ickling and preserving is what Sydney’s Cornersmith’s restaurant is known for. We pickle not just because we love the taste, but because pickling is an important food tradition that needs to be understood and passed down the generations. Preserving makes you understand the seasons, helps you to know what’s going into your food, and avoid unnecessary preservatives and packaging. It also massively reduces food waste. On top of all of that, it’s good fun.
Having a pantry full of pickles very quickly makes a meal more interesting. If you can toss some sliced pickled ginger through a noodle dish or throw some pickled peaches through a leafy green salad, you’ll not only have something incredibly delicious, but you’ll know you preserved the best of the season to use any time of the year. A home-made relish will make your work sandwiches a whole lot more exciting, and you’ll be the hero of the barbecue if you bring a few jars of delicious chutney.
Preparation time 25 minutes, plus 20 minutes sterilising, plus one hour salting. Can be stored for up to three months.
So addictive are these pickles, you’ll be lucky if they make it past the first meal. They are delicious with curries, or mixed through Asian-style salads.
For a quick and tasty salsa to serve with seafood or tacos, finely dice some of the pickled mango and mix in a small amount of the brine, lots of fresh chopped coriander (cilantro), and fresh chilli to taste.
Peel the mangoes, then cut the flesh into long strips about 1cm thick. Place in a bowl and sprinkle with the salt. Mix with your hands to evenly coat, then leave to sit for at least an hour, to draw the excess moisture out.
While your mango is salting, sterilise your jars and lids (see below).
Meanwhile, in a dry frying pan, lightly toast all the spices over medium heat for one or two minutes, or until fragrant, taking care not to burn the fenugreek seeds or they will become bitter.
Make your brine by combining the vinegar, sugar and water in a non-reactive, medium-sized saucepan. Place over low heat and stir to dissolve the sugar, then bring to simmering point. Turn off the heat and allow to cool a little.
When the jars are cool enough to handle, drain off and discard the excess liquid from your mango strips; you can wrap them in paper towel to dry them off a bit.
Put two curry leaves and two teaspoons of your spice mix into the bottom of each jar. Carefully pack the mango strips in. They will have become quite soft from the salting; you want to get as much as you can into each jar, without squashing or breaking up the mango strips.
Cover with the brine, making sure the mango strips are completely submerged under the vinegar.
Remove any air bubbles by gently tapping each jar on the work surface and sliding a clean butter knife or chopstick around the inside to release any hidden air pockets. Wipe the rims of the jars with paper towel or a clean damp cloth and seal immediately.
We prefer to keep these pickles in the fridge, as the texture seems to deteriorate quite quickly. They’re best eaten within three months.
This is a great recipe when you’re completely overloaded with tomatoes. These preserved tomatoes are so full of flavour and are excellent thinly sliced through pasta, in tomato salads, or with ricotta and lots of pepper on toast. Can be stored for up to six months.
2kg tomatoes
2 tsp salt
375ml (1 cups) white wine vinegar
185ml ( cup) water
75g ( cup) sugar
optional flavourings, such as peeled garlic, black peppercorns, thyme, oregano sprigs and/or basil stems
150–200ml olive oil or vegetable oil
Preheat your oven to its lowest setting. We set ours to 65C, but most domestic ovens can only go as low as 100C (210F). You can also use a dehydrator if you have one.
Wash your tomatoes and cut them in halves or quarters, depending on their size. Place on a baking tray lined with baking paper, or on a wire rack set over a baking tray. Sprinkle with the salt and place in the oven.
For ovens set to 100C, the tomatoes can take seven to nine hours to dry. For ovens set to 65C, the tomatoes can take 10 to 12 hours to dry. You want your tomatoes to be mostly dried, but still maintain some plumpness. If your oven feels too hot, you can wedge the door open with a wooden spoon to increase the airflow. (If using a dehydrator, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for advice on a suitable length of drying time.)
When the tomatoes have finished drying, leave to cool completely.
Sterilise your jars and lids (see below).
Make your brine by combining the vinegar, water and sugar in a small, non-reactive saucepan. Place over low heat and stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring to simmering point, then turn off the heat.
When the jars are cool enough to handle, add any spices or herbs you wish to use, such as one garlic clove, four peppercorns and one thyme sprig. Using small clean tongs or clean hands, carefully pack the dried tomatoes into the jars. Pour the hot brine over the tomatoes, filling each jar only three-quarters of the way up.
Remove any air bubbles by gently tapping each jar on the work surface and sliding a clean butter knife or chopstick around the inside of the jars to release any hidden air pockets. Fill each jar with oil, leaving a 5mm (1/4 inch) gap at the top. Wipe the rims of the jars with paper towel or a clean damp cloth and seal immediately.
Leave to cool on the benchtop, then store in a cool, dark place for up to six months. If the weather is particularly hot, store the tomatoes in the fridge.
Once opened, refrigerate and use within three months.
Preparation time 30 minutes, plus two hours salting, plus 20 minutes sterilising. Heat-processing 10 minutes. Can be stored for up to two years.
Make lots of this pickle! It’s really delicious and very easy. We made them one year when there weren’t many cucumbers around and they’ve become a staple at Cornersmith. We serve them everywhere you’d use a classic bread-and-butter pickle. You can leave the chilli out, or add more if you like your pickles hot.
Be sure you don’t overpack these jars. If you squish in too much zucchini, the excess moisture in them will be released and make your vinegar brine too watery to preserve properly. And once you’ve eaten all the pickles, save the brine to use in salad dressings – just whisk in some olive oil and cracked black pepper.
Thinly slice the zucchini, to about the thickness of a coin, and place in a large bowl. Thinly slice the onions and mix thoroughly through the zucchini. Sprinkle with the salt and leave to sit for at least two hours, to draw out any excess liquid; the larger the zucchini, the longer the mixture will need to sit.
Transfer the zucchini and onion slices to a colander and leave to sit until the liquid has drained out.
Sterilise your jars and lids (see below).
Make your brine by combining the vinegar, water and sugar in a non-reactive, medium-sized saucepan. Place over low heat and stir to dissolve the sugar. Increase the heat and bring to the boil.
Place the onion and zucchini slices in a large bowl. Add the mint and spices, mixing with your hand to evenly disperse them.
When the jars are cool enough to handle, use a pair of small clean tongs or clean hands to carefully pack the zucchini mixture into them, so that each jar is full but not overpacked. Remember the brine needs to cover every slice of zucchini, and if they are packed too tightly the brine cannot coat them evenly. Slowly fill the jars with hot brine until the vegetables are completely covered.
Remove any air bubbles by gently tapping each jar on the work surface and sliding a clean butter knife or chopstick around the inside to release any hidden air pockets. Wipe the rims of the jars with paper towel or a clean damp cloth and seal.
Heat process (see below) for 10 minutes, then store in a cool, dark place for up to two years. Once opened, refrigerate and use within six months.
To sterilise jars or bottles, give them a wash in hot soapy water and a good rinse, then place upright in a baking dish in a cold oven. Heat the oven to 110C and, once it has reached temperature, leave the jars in the oven for about 10–15 minutes, or until completely dry, then remove them carefully.
For hot packing, pour the hot chutney straight into the hot jars; for cold packing,
let the jars cool before adding your pickles or preserves.
To sterilise the lids, place them in a large saucepan of boiling water for 5 minutes, then drain and dry with clean paper towels, or leave them on a wire rack to air dry. Make sure they are completely dry before using.
Also called “water bathing” or “canning”, this process uses heat to stop the growth of bacteria. It generates pressure inside the preserving jar or bottle, which forces out any oxygen, creating an uninhabitable environment for micro-organisms. Treating your preserves in this way has two benefits: it lengthens their shelf life, and it ensures the jars or bottles are sealed correctly.
Opinions differ on when heat-processing is necessary, but at Cornersmith we encourage our students to heat-process any cold-packed preserves, pickles and bottled fruit – as well as large batches of chutneys and jams that will be stored for some time.
Get the biggest pan you have, such as a stockpot – the taller, the better – and put it on the stovetop. Lay a folded tea towel in the bottom of the pan, then sit your jars on the tea towel, taking care not to cram them in, and keeping them clear of the sides of the pan. (All these measures are to stop the jars from wobbling around and cracking as the water boils.)
Roughly match the water temperature to the temperature of the jars (to help prevent breakages from thermal shock), then pour in enough water to cover the jars, either completely or at least until three-quarters submerged. Bring to the boil over medium heat. The heat-processing times given in the recipes start from boiling point, and will generally be 10–15 minutes for jars or bottles up to 500ml (2 cup) capacity, or 20 minutes for larger capacities.
Once the heat-processing time is up, the lids should be puffed up and convex. Carefully remove the hot jars from the water. If you’ve bought some clamps, now is the time to use them, or you can use oven mitts and a thick cloth to protect your hands.
Line your jars up on the benchtop and let them sit overnight. As they cool, a vacuum will form inside each jar and suck down the lid, sealing them securely. In the morning, the lids should be concave: either get down to eye level with the top of the jar to check for the telltale dip in the lid, or lay a pencil across each lid to show the cavity below it.
If you have concerns about the seal of any of your jars (sometimes a couple of jars fail to seal correctly), store them in the fridge and use their contents within a few weeks.

"Treatment costs for the uninsured can be staggering, but that is no reason to turn to credit cards as a means of finance. Ideally, the uninsured should shop around before seeking treatment, but that is not always possible. But even after receiving the bill, most providers will be able to adjust their rates and offer payment plans with little or no interest.
It is one thing to earn rewards by making a charge to a credit card that can be immediately paid off, but it is another matter to use credit cards as a means of finance. By understanding why it almost never makes sense to finance some charges with a credit card, you can make the best decisions when presented with a major expense.

"Coastal areas around Britain are at “very high risk” of an asteroid tsunami that has the potential to kill hundreds of thousands of people.
Scientistsat the University of Southampton have found that although the UK is unlikely to be hit directly by an asteroid, it is at risk of huge deadly tsunami waves caused by an asteroid smashing into the Atlantic sea. Their announcement coincided with World Asteroid Day, an event which is co-founded by Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May to raise awareness about the importance of monitoring space rocks.
Experts are currently aware of 500 asteroids in the solar system with the potential to strike Earth. While a total of 13,000 have been discovered and logged, there are thought to be a million asteroids in the solar system.
PhD student Clemens Rumpf has developed a software program called ARMOR, which calculates the risk of asteroids hitting Earth and their likely site of impact.
Britain was found to be at high risk of an asteroid tsunami because it is an island with lots of coastline.
“We can now calculate where they could impact and the damage that would be caused so that we could get evacuation plans in order,” Rumpf said.
“When an asteroid strikes, one of the biggest problems is a tsunami. Britain is an island with lots of coastline, and lots of people living there, so it is a risk,” he added.
Scientists hope the new software could be used by organizations like the United Nations to prepare for potential asteroid impacts.
The data factors in population levels, making southeast Britain one of the most at-risk areas on the map.
The United States is largely risk-free, except for Florida and Louisiana, while Eastern Australia is particularly high risk.
Hugh Lewis, senior lecturer in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Southampton, said: “It’s very easy to be flippant because of the Hollywood effect but it is a real risk. When you look at global vulnerability Britain is at very high risk. You might think that is odd because we are a very small country but we have a high population density on the coastline so that means we are vulnerable to an impact in the Atlantic Ocean.
“Small asteroids are hitting the Earth all the time, and even if we don’t [get] anything large, we are still likely to have tens of thousands of people dying in the next 85 years. It has a similar death toll to other natural disasters.
Lewis added: “This new software not only allows us to see where an impact is likely to happen but we also simulate what might happen if we tried to deflect it, such as by using a spacecraft to give it a slow push in space.”
The last major asteroid to strike Earth was in 1908, when a space rock hit Siberia with the energy of 1,000 atomic bombs.
Due to the sparseness of the area nobody was hurt, despite 80 million trees being felled over an area of 830 square miles.
Researchers estimate if the asteroid had struck London it is likely to have killed everyone within the M25 motorway that rings the capital.",1
"SAN FRANCISCO —Google on Tuesday rolled out a nasty-complicated butinsanely secure version of its Google accountsaimed at ""those who need it most,"" such as journalists, politicians and activists. It's not prettybut stands a good chance of keeping the bad guys out.
Called theAdvanced Protection Program, it requires users to jump through a series of hoopsmost Internet companies have workedfor years to make go away— dongles, extra passwords, locked-down systems that can't talk to anything else and a non-intuitive sign-up procedure.
This is so notplug-and-play.
What it is, however, is safe. Not ""I work for the National Security Agency and print out the nuclear codes every time they change"" safe, but more ""I'm working on a Senate campaign and we really don't want the Russians, or anyone else, to get into our email system"" safe.
Signing up requires a Googleaccount and then linking not one but two dongles, orsmall devices that connects to a computer's USB port or via Bluetooth. Each produces a highly secure code key that uses the standards of the international FIDO Alliance (for Fast IDentity Online.)
These plastic keys are about the size of a regular door keybut instead holdcodes Google uses to verify that you’re you and that you should have access to the account. The key can go into the USB drive on a computer or via Bluetooth to a mobile device such as a phone.
While the secure accounts are free, the hardware to make them secure costs money. A USB security key runs about $25 while the Bluetooth-enabled keys are about $18.
Once you’ve tied these keys to your Google account, you’ve got to have one of them present in order to access your mail and files.
Otherwise— take note—it's Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect Your Email.
""What I think has changed is that people recognize they may never be able to 'learn'how to act optimally in a defensive sense, so this program literally eliminates many sources of humans messing up,"" saidJoseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist with the Washington D. C.-based non-profit the Center for Democracy & Technology.
That means using alocked-down Gmail account which may not have all the functionality a more open one could have, though Google does say it’s exploring adding access to some trusted partners as time goes by.
And about thatdongle? Youreally, really don’t want to lose it,or forget yourpassword. Google hasn’t even said what the recovery process will look like, but it is expectedtake three to five days.
This isn’t an email system for everybody, Hall said. Those who are considering it shouldthink carefully about the threats they face before they sign on.For most regular email users it will be overkill.
But if someone's possibly being targeted by a nation state attackeror very determined attackers or organized criminals, the answer is a clear yes, he said.
“Sexual assault and domestic violence victims, billionaires, finance employees, judgesand law enforcement officers — they certainly face these threats and should use it,” he said.
The system also doesn't allow users the freedom that non-secure Google accounts have. Once signed up, their Google account is only able to gather data from a few secure appsso that miscreants can’t get to their inbox or Google drive via them.
In a way, this is an admission of defeatbut also of reality. The Holy Grail of online security has long been a system with serious security that was as easy to use as any other program.
With the launch of Advanced Protection, Google isacknowledging that while no one has come up with something that's both easy to use and secure, there areenough people out there who really need protection that even a somewhat gnarly program is going to find users.",0

Strep throat is caused by the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria and is more common in children. Its most frequent symptoms are a pain in the throat and inflammation.
It is usually treated with antibiotics, but we will suggest several natural remedies which can help you treat the inflamed and painful throat and fight bacteria in a simple and fast way!
Honey
Honey has powerful antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties which effectively treat inflammation, infections, and pain. It also quickly fights bacteria, so it will provide an almost instant relief.
*Vitamin C- Lemon
Lemons are abundant in vitamin C, which has potent antibacterial qualities, which will treat the infection and soothe the throat pain. You should prepare a tea with some lemon juice and honey.
Essential Oils
Essential oils can provide amazing benefits in the case of strep throat. You can use lemon, grapefruit,  lemongrass, thyme, lavender, or cinnamon essential oil. Prepare the following remedy:
-Add five drops of some of the essential oils listed above in some water. Pour this mixture into a pan and heat it. Then, use the steam from the solution for inhalation for about 10-15 minutes. Repeat as many times as needed during the day.
Apple Cider Vinegar
Apple cider vinegar is one of the most effective natural remedies for infections. You should mix 3 tablespoons of it with 8oz of warm water. Use this solution to gargle, and you will feel the improvements very soon.
Cayenne Pepper
Mix a teaspoon of cayenne pepper powder with half a cup of coconut or olive oil to treat strep throat. The application of this mixture on the area of the throat will also relax the tensed muscles and treat the infection.
Hence, you no longer need to use antibiotics to relieve the strep throat: Instead, choose som of these homemade remedies and solve your problem in an easy and natural way!

"(Before It's News)Black holes make for a great space mystery. They’re so massive that nothing, not even light, can escape a black hole once it gets close enough. A great mystery for scientists is that there’s evidence of powerful jets of electrons and protons that shoot out of the top and bottom of some black holes. Yet no one knows how these jets form.
Computer code called Cosmos now fuels supercomputer simulations of black hole jets and is starting to reveal the mysteries of black holes and other space oddities.

Fragile pointed out that Cosmos provides astrophysicists an advantage because it has stayed at the forefront of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). MHD simulations, the magnetism of electrically conducting fluids such as black hole jets, add a layer of understanding but are notoriously difficult for even the fastest supercomputers.
“The other area that Cosmos has always had some advantage in as well is that it has a lot of physics packages in it,” continued Fragile. “This was Peter Anninos’ initial motivation, in that he wanted one computational tool where he could put in everything he had worked on over the years.” Fragile listed some of the packages that include chemistry, nuclear burning, Newtonian gravity, relativistic gravity, and even radiation and radiative cooling. “It’s a fairly unique combination,” Fragile said.
The current iteration of the code is CosmosDG, which utilizes discontinuous Gelarkin methods. “You take the physical domain that you want to simulate,” explained Fragile, “and you break it up into a bunch of little, tiny computational cells, or zones. You’re basically solving the equations of fluid dynamics in each of those zones.” CosmosDG has allowed much higher order of accuracy than ever before, according to results published in the Astrophysical Journal, August 2017.
“We were able to demonstrate that we achieved many orders of magnitude more accurate solutions in that same number of computational zones,” stated Fragile. “So, particularly in scenarios where you need very accurate solutions, CosmosDG may be a way to get that with less computational expense than we would have had to use with previous methods.”
Since 2008, the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) has provided computational resources for the development of the Cosmos code–about 6.5 million supercomputer core hours on the Ranger system and 3.6 million core hours on the Stampede system. XSEDE, the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment funded by the National Science Foundation, awarded Fragile’s group with the allocation.
“I can’t praise enough how meaningful the XSEDE resources are,” Fragile said. “The science that I do wouldn’t be possible without resources like that. That’s a scale of resources that certainly a small institution like mine could never support. The fact that we have these national-level resources enables a huge amount of science that just wouldn’t get done otherwise.”
And the fact is that busy scientists can sometimes use a hand with their code. In addition to access, XSEDE also provides a pool of experts through the Extended Collaborative Support Services (ECSS) effort to help researchers take full advantage of some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers.
Fragile has recently enlisted the help of XSEDE ECSS to optimize the CosmosDG code for Stampede2, a supercomputer capable of 18 petaflops and the flagship of TACC at The University of Texas at Austin. Stampede2 features 4,200 Knights Landing (KNL) nodes and 1,736 Intel Xeon Skylake nodes.
The manycore architecture of KNL presents new challenges for researchers trying to get the best compute performance, according to Damon McDougall, a research associate at TACC and also at the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, UT Austin. Each Stampede2 KNL node has 68 cores, with four hardware threads per core. That’s a lot of moving pieces to coordinate.
“This is a computer chip that has lots of cores compared to some of the other chips one might have interacted with on other systems,” McDougall explained. “More attention needs to be paid to the design of software to run effectively on those types of chips.”
Through ECSS, McDougall has helped Fragile optimize CosmosDG for Stampede2. “We promote a certain type of parallelism, called hybrid parallelism, where you might mix Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocols, which is a way of passing messages between compute nodes, and OpenMP, which is a way of communicating on a single compute node,” McDougall said. “Mixing those two parallel paradigms is something that we encourage for these types of architectures. That’s the type of advice we can help give and help scientists to implement on Stampede2 though the ECSS program.”
“By reducing how much communication you need to do,” Fragile said, “that’s one of the ideas of where the gains are going to come from on Stampede2. But it does mean a bit of work for legacy codes like ours that were not built to use OpenMP. We’re having to retrofit our code to include some OpenMP calls. That’s one of the things Damon has been helping us try to make this transition as smoothly as possible.”
McDougall described the ECSS work so far with CosmosDG as “very nascent and ongoing,” with much initial work sleuthing memory allocation ‘hot spots’ where the code slows down.
“One of the things that Damon McDougall has really been helpful with is helping us make the codes more efficient and helping us use the XSEDE resources more efficiently so that we can do even more science with the level of resources that we’re being provided,” Fragile added.
Some of the science Fragile and colleagues have already done with the help of the Cosmos code has helped study accretion, the fall of molecular gases, and space debris into a black hole. Black hole accretion powers its jets. “One of the things I guess I’m most famous for is studying accretion disks where the disk is tilted,” explained Fragile.
Black holes spin. And so do the disk of gasses and debris that surrounds it and falls in. However, they spin on different axes of rotation. “We were the first people to study cases where the axis of rotation of the disk is not aligned with the axis of rotation of the black hole,” Fragile said. General relativity shows that rotating bodies can exert a torque on other rotating bodies that aren’t aligned with it.
Fragile’s simulations showed the black hole wobbles, a movement called precession, from the torque of the spinning accretion disk. “The really interesting thing is that over the last five years or so, observers–the people who actually use telescopes to study black hole systems–have seen evidence that the disks might actually be doing this precession that we first showed in our simulations,” Fragile said.
Fragile and colleagues use the Cosmos code to study other space oddities such as tidal disruption events, which happen when a molecular cloud or star passes close enough that a black hole shreds it. Other examples include Minkowski’s Object, where Cosmos simulations support observations that a black hole jet collides with a molecular cloud to trigger star formation.
“We’re living in a golden age of astronomy,” Fragile said, referring to the wealth of knowledge generated from space telescopes like Hubble to the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, to land-based telescopes such as Keck, and more.
Computing has helped support the success of astronomy, Fragile said. “What we do in modern-day astronomy couldn’t be done without computers,” he concluded. “The simulations that I do are two-fold. They’re to help us better understand the complex physics behind astrophysical phenomena. But they’re also to help us interpret and predict observations that either have been, can be, or will be made in astronomy.”",1
"(CNN) -- Each day an estimated 6,000 Americans will try marijuana for the first time. It's the most common illicit drug in the United States with nearly 15 million people using it at least once a month.
Melissa Etheridge took medical marijuana to help her through her chemotherapy.
All this week, ""Anderson Cooper 360"" is taking a close look at the deeply divisive issue of drug legalization in a series of reports. It's a special ""360"" investigation called ""America's High: The case for and against pot.""
The topic of medical marijuana inspires particular controversy. As of right now, 13 states have laws that permit marijuana, also know as cannabis, to be taken for medical conditions. There is no prescription for cannabis; instead doctors issue a recommendation in these states.
But is it safe? Is it effective? Does it actually work?
Melissa Etheridge says it worked for her. The Grammy Award-winning singer- songwriter turned to marijuana after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004.  Watch Etheridge talk about how marijuana affected her 
In an interview, Etheridge talked to CNN's Anderson Cooper on why she did it and how she believes it helped restore her health. She's now pushing for its legalization.
The following is an edited version of the interview.
Melissa Etheridge: I'm actually grateful for my cancer diagnosis.
Anderson Cooper: Grateful because it changed your life?
Etheridge: It changed my life; woke me up totally.
Cooper: What is the pain [of chemotherapy] like?
Etheridge: It was just a general pain of your body dying, of all your cells dying. Your appetite is gone. And you are nauseous. And your hair is falling out. Your skin -- it's like death. And the only thing I could do is lay there. I can't -- it hurt to -- light hurt, sound hurt. I couldn't read anything. I just laid there.
(Etheridge didn't want to use Vicodin or other prescription pills, she said.)
All of these things have side effects. So, the steroids and the pain relief that they give you on that first day when you go into chemotherapy causes constipation. So they will -- here is a pill for the constipation which will give you diarrhea. And you get huge side effects from all of this.
Cooper: The first time you did [marijuana], it made a big difference?
Etheridge: Instantly -- and instantly within a minute relieves the nausea, relieves the pain. And all of a sudden I was normal. You don't take medicinal marijuana to get high.
Cooper: So you weren't getting high?
Etheridge: No you don't get a high. No it's not a high. It was normal. And I could -- all of a sudden I could get out of bed. I could go see my kid. And it was amazing. (Etheridge often didn't smoke; the marijuana was mixed into butter and spread on food, or run through a vaporizer.)
Cooper: Did you ever worry about becoming addicted? They were saying this is a gateway drug?
Etheridge: No. Not at all. If you were on that side, you would understand what I mean. It is almost laughable to think that you could be addicted. This is not at all.
Cooper: You mention you still have a prescription. Do you still use marijuana?
Etheridge: Yes, I do. The effects on my gastrointestinal system leave me with a real intolerance for acid of any kind, and so acid reflux is a constant problem. I don't want to take the little pills that they give you that have all the side effects to help with that.
And I do use it -- I'm one of the users that would like in a stressful situation or maybe when I've eaten that cheese pizza with my kids that I will do that and it settles -- totally completely settles all that.
Cooper: Most people eat the cheese pizza after the marijuana.
Etheridge: That is true.
Cooper: You've got it backwards.
Etheridge: No. It's not like that. I know.
Cooper: There's more than, I think, 200,000 people in California who are registered to receive medicinal marijuana. Do you really believe that all those people though have legitimate reasons to be getting marijuana?
Etheridge: Yes. Who are we to say what a legitimate reason is? If it helps somebody at the end of the day instead of drinking a couple of glasses of wine, to have a few tokes, who are we to say? Why must we in this country be so judgmental about this? These people are not hurting anybody. They are not hurting themselves.

"Six million Americans have already booked their holiday flights — but while they may have chosen from the most options when booking (and dodged the stress of having to worry about it later), they likely spent more than they would have had they waited until mid-fall.
""The early birds probably didn't get the best deal,"" said Robin Saks Frankel, an analyst at Bankrate.com, referencing research from Hopper. “The best time to book for Christmas is early October, while flights for Thanksgiving remain stable through the end of October.""
Not what you expected? You’re not alone. The idea that the earlier you book, the more you’ll save is a common one.
Even Bankrate’s Saks Frankel was surprised to learn that buying in summer or even early fall doesn’t net you the best prices on airfare. But this is actually becoming something of a trend.
“We also saw [this] last year,” said Kimberly Palmer, personal finance expert at NerdWallet. “October seems to be the sweet spot for holiday travel deals, with prices fluctuating based on the supply and demand of flights.”
Zach Honig, editor-in-chief at The Points Guy, explained that airfares “drop considerably,” after the end of summer. Furthermore, “airfares are based on demand, so demand is likely lower during the October time period, as leisure travelers reserve vacation days for holiday periods when they can make the most of a long trip.”
Bear in mind that you don’t want to wait past that October “sweet spot,” as it were. Once November starts, ticket prices are going to go up, and will continue to soar on through the remainder of the season.
“Prices go up once you are within three weeks of the departure date, and even more so once you are within 10 days, so you could definitely end up paying more if you wait until the last minute,” said Palmer.
And of course, it should be noted that for many people, it’s not realistic to wait until October to finalize holiday plans.
""Most people are working with a limited amount of vacation days and can't run the risk of specific flights or accommodations selling out, so any additional expense incurred by advance booking is worth it for peace of mind,” said Corinne McDermott, founder of HaveBabyWillTravel.com.
Bankrate’s survey revealed that 33 percent of travelers book their flights directly through an airline’s website, while 25 percent use a travel comparison site. Just five percent use their credit card’s website (aka, shopping portal) to book their travel.
Yet using your credit card’s website to book your airfare is an easy way to rack up points or other rewards such as cash back. Every rewards credit card is different, but the gist is the same for pretty much all of them: Use the portal (and the designated credit card) to pay for goodies, and the more you spend, the more you’ll get in return. It’s designed to be a win-win for everyone: the credit card company, the airline (or other vendor), and you.
“I am surprised at how few people are going through their credit cards’ websites to book the flights to make sure they are getting the most out of their rewards,” said Palmer. “That indicates a lot of people are probably missing out on travel savings.”
Why are so few people taking advantage of these cushy rewards? For starters, they may not know these credit card portals exist.
“You have to kind of look for these portals, and [learning how to navigate them] requires some patience,” said Bankrate’s Saks Frankel, adding that though more and more credit card companies are providing them, it takes some poking around.
It may take time, but the payoff is clear, and if you don’t have a credit card that offers bonuses, you may want to consider signing up for one now — they heap on the rewards incentives for new customers.
“Many of these travel rewards cards that charge an annual fee might waive it the first year,” said Saks Frankel, who recommends putting big expenses on the credit card (so long as you can promptly pay it off) in order to activate the rewards immediately.",0

“I have seen landscapes, notably in the Mourne Mountains and southwards which, under a particular light, made me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge.” So wrote CS Lewis of this mountainous patch of his homeland. Adventure abounds on this demanding walk, which encompasses three of the highest peaks in the Mournes: Slieve Donard, Commedagh and Bearnagh. The summit of the second offers fine panoramic views of the High Mournes, while the choppy straights of the Irish Sea can be seen from the third. You can follow in smugglers’ footsteps, too, along the infamous Brandy Pad track. So busy was this clandestine trading route in days past that half the houses in the village of Hilltown were said to be pubs. Sláinte, Prince Caspian.

In centuries past, farmers from across Wales would entrust their sheep, cattle and even geese to delivery agents or drovers, who would transport them on foot to the market towns of England. Many of those flocks and herds would have passed this way towards their fateful end. That said, if you had to choose anywhere for a final stroll through the British countryside, you’d be hard pushed to choose better than this delightful ridgeline walk. On a clear day, the views spread out for 70 miles or more, from Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons in Wales over to the Shropshire hills across the border. A popular bridle track as well, the ridgeway path leads from Powys (Wales) into Shropshire (England) and regularly alternates between moorland, woodland and heath. A successful red-kite breeding and protection programme nearby means you’re almost guaranteed to spot one of these fork-tailed predators. The 775 bus runs from Bishop’s Castle to Newtown, close(ish) to the start.

Refreshment The Old Quay Inn
The early 19th century was boom time for mining in Cornwall, transforming the now peaceful coastal villages of Portreath and Devoran into busy industrial ports. This 11-mile route along the west country peninsula follows the line of two early horse-drawn tramways, along which the tin and copper would once have trundled. The tramways form part of a network of similar supply routes that are now collectively recognised as Cultural Routes by the Council of Europe. Popular with cyclists as well as ramblers, this coast-to-coast hike is peppered with interpretation boards fixed to granite stones that give insights into Cornwall’s mining past. The scenery speaks for itself, however, with gritty, denuded “mine-scapes” interspersing the otherwise gentle woodlands and grassy glades. The 46 bus returns to Portreath.

Measuring 127 miles and containing 91 locks, the Leeds and Liverpool canal is the longest watercourse of its kind in northern England. Reminders of the area’s industrial past are evident in the old factories and mills that cluster along the canal’s banks. The best known of these awaits in Saltaire, home to the huge textile mill of Victorian philanthropist Titus Salt. Now a designated Unesco world heritage site, the beautifully restored Salts Mill is home to a gallery dedicated to David Hockney. On the outskirts of Keighley, you’ll be treated to another masterwork: the Bingley Five-Rise and Three-Rise Locks. Truly inspired engineering, the lower gate of each chamber connects to the upper gate of the chamber below, creating the impression of an aquatic staircase. So audacious was this design that 30,000 people turned up to the inauguration in 1774. Trains run regularly between Saltaire and Skipton.

The village of the country’s greatest literary figure has been subsumed into the historic country town of Ayr, but in a jiff you’re out in open country. Before heading into the hills, be sure to visit the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum. Starting out along a combination of country roads and track, the route takes you around the grounds of Newark Castle before climbing upwards into the Carrick hills. On a clear day, the Firth of Clyde looks resplendent from here, basking “gaily in the sunny beam”. The return is along the coast, to Alloway via the Burns monument, close to the Brig o’Doon (Old Bridge of Doon) of Tam O’Shanter poem fame.

Refreshment The White Swan
This long but comparatively easy walk affords fine views and handsome scenery, but its real appeal lies in its connections to the seventh-century bishop and pilgrim St Cuthbert. After dropping down to the Till river (English tributary of the river Tweed) from Wooler, the route travels through rolling arable fields until it reaches St Cuthbert’s Cave, a natural sandstone feature where St Cuthbert’s dead yet itinerant body is said to have briefly lain. Soon afterwards, you’re out on top of Greensheen hill, enjoying fine views of the North Sea coast. To the south lie Bamburgh Castle and the Farne Islands, but it’s to Lindisfarne (also known as Holy Island) in the north-east that the path leads. An important centre of Celtic Christianity, Lindisfarne is teeming with wildlife, as well as religious history. Be mindful of the tides as the “island” is accessible via a causeway, which disappears during high tide. To return, take the bus from Beal to Wooler.

A shoreline classic, this blustery coastal path leads you along a magnificent escarpment of alabaster-white chalk cliffs. The star attraction is the Seven Sisters, a section of undulating hilltops between Cuckmere Haven and Birling Gap. As well as summits (with characterful names like Rough Brow and Brass Point), the route brings you right down to the shoreline in places, so pack your swimmers if it’s a sunny day. This section of the South Downs Way includes a second landmark: Beachy Head. At 162m high, it’s the tallest chalk cliff in Britain – a feature that, regrettably, has made it infamous for suicides. The cliff now seems to be following suit, with chunks of chalk periodically toppling into the sea. Erosion is a persistent danger right along the route, so keep your distance from the cliff edge.

With tiny terns looping the loop and waders skipping through the grasslands, spring is the perfect time to visit Walberswik National Nature Reserve on the Suffolk coast. This walk is one for twitchers, with avocets, godwits, pintails and wigeons among the possible sightings. If you can tear yourself away from reed beds, estuary marshes, saline lagoons and shingle beaches, then there’s a very pleasant circular walk to be had, too. From lovely Southwold village, head inland through the nature reserve and down through a small forest to the equally scenic Dunwich, before heading back along the coastal mudflats and sand dunes. On the return leg, try grabbing the ferry across the river Blyth (operates daily from June to September) at Walberswick.

Refreshment Kintail Lodge At 114 metres, the Falls of Glomach boast the single biggest drop of any waterfalls in the UK. Despite their gravity-gushing, depth-charging descent, however, they are curiously easy to miss – a phenomenon that has led some to call them the “hidden” falls. This disappearing act is partly because of their position: up a narrow gorge in a remote corner of the Scottish highlands. The cascade’s own spray contributes to the concealment, enveloping the whole scene in a damp veil of mist and mystery. Start and finish at the Forestry car park near Morvich (Citilink buses from Glasgow and Inverness stop at Allt a’chruinn, two miles away). After a short climb through the forest, you’ll emerge above the tree line into wild highland scenery. Although the track is well-marked, the weather is notoriously fickle here, so pack for all weathers.

An early section of the little-known Roman Way walk, this walk offers an archaeologically intriguing ramble through the heart of the Cotswold hills. The route crosses over the limestone heights along the last leg of Akeman Street, a major Roman road running west from modern-day St Albans to Cirencester (or Corinium, as the Romans knew it). Starting out in the unspoiled Coln river valley, the path rolls past a series of ancient villages close to Ampney brook and the river Churn. It’s worth keeping up a good pace as the real archaeological treats await towards the end. On the outskirts of Cirencester stand the grass-covered remains of a Roman amphitheatre. Reserve time for the Roman museum in town, too, home to an impressive pottery collection as well as a rare, recently discovered tombstone.

This customised circular ramble was devised by Where2Walk’s Jonathan Smith to show off the best of the Dales. It skirts the 723m Ingleborough peak, Buckden Pike and Great Whernside, which make for easy side walks, and whose stark slopes and flat tops soften into valleys, such as Dentdale and Wensleydale. Tackled in stretches of about 15 miles a day, the limestone pavement of Malham Cove (featured hilariously in a scene from Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s The Trip) and sharp ravine Gordale Scar are among early highlights. But geographical delights keep coming, with England’s highest single-drop waterfall Hardraw Force, near Hawes (day four), multi-stepped Aysgarth Falls and a host of timeless dales, villages and hamlets. One of these, Feizor, is home to Elaine’s tearoom/restaurant, a meeting point for walkers at the junction of several paths. The route covers a few miles of the Pennine Way – and it makes a shorter alternative to, or good training for, that longer and more challenging trail.

In March, this hike from Farnham to Dover became the first national trail to be captured by Google Street View from start to finish, enabling prospective walkers to check terrain, route and pubs before they set off. Proximity to London and the M25-M20 might dissuade walkers from giving the North Downs a go but the route is almost entirely in areas of outstanding natural beauty and often feels suitably remote. It also resonates with historical significance, from pre-Roman times through Chaucer and the medieval pilgrims, to Darwin (whose observations were made close to the west Kent stretch of the trail), and the Battle of Britain, fought overhead. There are quaint old villages on the Way, like Chilham in Kent, fantastic views across the Garden of England, streams, springs, beech and oak woodland, idyllic meadows, rare orchids, butterflies and birds, and striking features such as the sharp cleft in the downs near Wye in Kent called the Devil’s Kneading Trough, Box Hill (Surrey) and Dover’s chalk cliffs. The North Downs Way can serve as a an ideal training ground to test your stamina, without having to worry about access (trains and buses are plentiful). It also makes a great (though rather long) pub crawl, with great inns (such as the White Horse in Chilham) and local breweries (Shepherd Neame, Westerham and Canterbury Ales) close to the route. Wild camping is not allowed along the trail but CampInMyGarden.com may provide some answers. There’s no shortage of pubs with rooms, B&Bs and hotels in the villages and towns along the way.

Named after Yosemite pioneer John Muir, who spent his early years at Dunbar (the trail’s eastern terminus), the walk breaks down into 10 sections, each doable in a day. The early stretches, starting on the Firth of Clyde at Helensburgh, traverse moors and forest and skirt glorious Loch Lomond; it later takes in canals, the extraordinary boat-shifting Falkirk Wheel, castles, tiny fishing ports and the small matter of Edinburgh.

Snowdonia? Brecon Beacons? Offa’s Dyke? All awesome – but well-trodden. So where in Wales can you find a grown-up, long-distance trail that’s properly in the sticks, where you might not meet anyone for hours on end, and where logistics aren’t so easy? Bang in the middle, of course, where there are rolling hills, forests, lakes, high moors, the low Cambrian mountains, a richly green landscape dotted with sheep, and settlements you’ve never heard of. In late medieval times, rebel prince Owain Glyndr restlessly crisscrossed this ground on his way to one battle or another, but he certainly never did this 135-mile route for the hell of it. Best broken into nine stages of about 15 strenuous, hilly miles each, the chevron-shaped trail starts at Knighton and ends at Welshpool, both of which are served by trains from Shrewsbury. At the halfway point is picturesque Machynlleth, also on the rail network, and site of Glyndr’s 1400s parliament. The small town is host to the Museum of Modern Art Wales and the superb Centre for Alternative Technology. It’s an ideal place to stop/start the hike if you want to break it into two sections of five days each – a good option, given the minimal bus services between the villages. It’s worth remembering, too, that mobile phone coverage is patchy on the trail, so it’s best to plan in advance, particularly as not every village has a pub or shop. B&Bs and campsites are plentiful, however.

England’s longest trail involves a daunting 35,000 metres of ascent (nearly four Everests), what with all those pesky inlets, undulating cliff tops and river valleys. Really fast walkers can combine a few sections and do the whole thing in up to six weeks but, starting on 25 April, Royal Marine Baz Gray will be looking to complete it in a record-breaking 10 days (he’ll be running) for charity. The huge variety of coastal scenery, including the giant heather-clad cliffs of north Devon, Cornwall’s rocky coves, Dorset’s fossil-rich shores, and the ever-present, explosive Atlantic, make it one of the most popular long trails in the world, with a huge number of spin-off walks. The ever-changing weather of the peninsula produces mood-altering light effects and the views on the northern stretches, across the Bristol Channel to south Wales, are mesmerising; sometimes the Welsh shore appears close enough to nip over to in a small boat with a picnic, but then it just vanishes as the weather shifts. If the 630 miles are not quite enough, you’ll be pleased to hear that you can extend to or from Minehead with a new 58-mile path to Brean, Somerset, via Watchet, part of the English Coast Trail, which is set to open in 2020.

One of the beauties of this delightful walk up on the 450m Catbells ridge is that, if you’re based in Keswick, you don’t need a car to reach the start point. Arrive intrepidly by boat, courtesy of the Keswick Launch which takes 10 minutes to reach the start of the walk at Hawse End (hourly service, take the anticlockwise boat around Derwent Water; the clockwise one takes 40 minutes). This trail is best for children over five, as there are a couple of points where a hand or two are needed (the word “scramble” overdramatises the scenario) and some mildly steep slopes. The rewards are views across the lake to the ridges and peaks of High Seat, Skiddaw, Grasmoor and towards Great Gable, that will lift the spirits – as will refreshments at the Swinside Inn at the end of this sumptuous walk.

Otters, sea and golden eagles, red-throated divers, dolphins and seals are often seen; in fact the whole area is great for rare fauna and flora, all of which can be enjoyed along this simple there-and-back walk on a marked track towards Glenbyre (two miles) and Carsaig (six miles). A handy starting point is the Old Post Office run by a family which has farmed in the area for decades and which provides refreshments from 9am-5pm, seven days a week. Lochbuie was the setting for the 1945 Powell and Pressburger film I Know Where I’m Going, described by both Martin Scorsese and Barry Norman as a masterpiece.

Distance 5 miles
Northumberland’s coast has a special, quiet atmosphere all of its own with sweeping sands, dunes alive with wild flowers in spring, and settlements with long memories of fishing, industry, intruders from the east and early Christianity. This simple there-and-back route starts in Craster (synonymous with top-notch kippers) and heads along the coast to ruined Dunstanburgh Castle. From there, continue past Greymare Rock, a limestone feature created by volcanic activity during the formation of the Whin Sill rock intrusion (on which Hadrian’s Wall was built), and make for the glorious beach of Embleton Bay, watching out for seals. You can go inland to make it a circular route but walking back with those sea views along the embankment and cliffs is the more scenic option. For refreshment, head to Embleton village and the Greys Inn, a friendly pub that serves real ales and good food. Back in Craster, the Jolly Fisherman is a fine historic pub for a meal.

"Jose Rodriguez has no regrets about the CIA using ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" -- methods that some consider torture - on suspected al Qaeda members detained and questioned after 9/11. Lesley Stahl interviews the former head of the CIA's Clandestine Service about waterboarding and other methods he says were essential to getting information from suspected terrorists, and he denies claims that these harsh measures caused detainees to provide false or unreliable information that misled the CIA. In fact, Rodriguez says that high-level detainees Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Abu Zubaydah provided their best information only after harsh treatment, a claim that the CIA's own investigator general has challenged.
The following script is from ""Hard Measures"" which originally aired on April 29, 2012. Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Richard Bonin, producer.
After the attacks of 9/11, the CIA sought and was granted unprecedented authority to capture al Qaeda suspects, whisk them off to secret sites and interrogate them with harsh techniques, including waterboarding.
The man who ran the interrogation program was Jose Rodriguez, a CIA spy in Latin America, who rose to become head of the Clandestine Service, the CIA's dark side.
When the agency's secret program was revealed, it was widely criticized but the blunt-spoken, Puerto Rican-born Rodriguez is fighting back.  He's written a book, a defense of the interrogations, called ""Hard Measures"" -- and tonight you will hear his side of the story.
It's the first time someone this close to the program, this accountable has gone public explaining why techniques that had long been condemned by the U. S. as torture were employed.
Jose Rodriguez: For the first time in our history, we had an enemy come into our homeland and kill 3,000 people. I mean, that was a huge deal. People jumping from the towers to their death. The people running away from the cloud of dust, terrified out of their mind. This was a threat. And we had to throw everything at it.
Which is why Jose Rodriguez says that when he ran the CIA's Counterterrorist Center, he came up with the idea of employing harsh interrogation techniques.  And10 years later, he feels he still has to justify their use.
Lesley Stahl: You had no qualms? We used to consider some of them war crimes.
Jose Rodriguez: We made some al Qaeda terrorists with American blood on their hands uncomfortable for a few days. But we did the right thing for the right reason. And the right reason was to protect the homeland and to protect American lives. So yes, I had no qualms.
Rodriguez spent 31 years in the CIA's Clandestine Service where spies are revered as ""fighter jocks"". He rose thru the ranks, eventually running covert operations as head of the Latin America division.  When al Qaeda struck on 9/11, he'd had no experience in counterterrorism or the Middle East.  But he wanted ""in"" on the war on terror, and went to the CIA's Counterterrorist Center, where the main objective was to stop another attack on the U. S. homeland.
Jose Rodriguez: We were flooded with intelligence about an imminent attack. That al Qaeda had an anthrax program, and that they were planning to use it against us. And that they were seeking nuclear materials to use in some type of nuclear weapon. So we were facing a ticking, time bomb situation and we were very concerned.
Lesley Stahl: So you were getting pressure from Congress and the White House to take the gloves off. Did you go to the dark side?
Jose Rodriguez: Well, the dark side, that's what we do.
Lesley Stahl: You are the dark side.
Jose Rodriguez: We are the dark side.
His first big operation came after the capture of a Palestinian, thought then to have high level al Qaeda connections, named Abu Zubaydah when he was taken prisoner in Pakistan in the spring of 2002, Abu Zubaydah was badly injured in a firefight.
Jose Rodriguez: He actually was on the verge of dying. So we brought in a surgeon from the U. S. to help him out.
Lesley Stahl: You brought in a top-rate surgeon from Johns Hopkins?
Jose Rodriguez: Yes, the best that we could find.
Lesley Stahl: You save him so you can squeeze everything out of his brain that you can?
Jose Rodriguez: So we could elicit intelligence that would allow us to keep our country safe. So we took him to a black site.
Black site. It was the first of several secret interrogation centers around the world. Abu Zubaydah was still recovering from his gunshot wounds when the interrogation began.
Lesley Stahl: When you start the interrogation, it's both the CIA and the FBI, right?
Jose Rodriguez: Correct. This was our prisoner, our site, our show -
Jose Rodriguez: The CIA, but we had invited the FBI to come along.
Now there's a big dispute over which agency got more information and more valuable information.  At first, FBI interrogators used their standard interviewing techniques with no coercion, and Abu Zubaydah cooperated, giving tips and leads but--
Jose Rodriguez: After he regains his strength he stopped talking.
Lesley Stahl: And then he just shuts down. Is that what happens?
But the FBI's lead interrogator said he didn't shut down, and that they should continue with their traditional methods of questioning.  Jose Rodriguez, though heard the ticking time bomb and felt a sense of urgency.
Jose Rodriguez: If there was going to be another attack against the U. S., we would have blood on our hands because we would not have been able to extract that information from him. So we started to talk about an alternative set of interrogation procedures.
Lesley Stahl: So you're the one who went looking for something to break this guy.
Jose Rodriguez: Yes. And let me tell you something, you know, because years later the 9/11 Commission accused, or said that 9/11 was a failure of imagination. Well, there was no lack of imagination on the part of the CIA in June 2002. We were looking for different ways of doing this.
His search led him to a former military psychologist who had helped train American soldiers in how to resist torture if they were captured. The psychologist adapted the brutal tactics of our Cold War adversaries into what the CIA called ""enhanced interrogation techniques.""  A team of interrogators -- about six of them -- was given a two-week training course and while Jose Rodriguez himself never engaged in any of the sessions with detainees, he supervised the program.
Lesley Stahl: Did the psychologist, did he tell you how long it was going to take, if you use these techniques, to break Abu Zubaydah and anybody else that you might capture?
Jose Rodriguez: You know, he had speculated that within 30 days we would probably be able to get the information that we wanted, yes.
But before moving forward, Jose Rodriguez got his superiors, right up to the president - to sign off on a set of those techniques, including waterboarding.
Jose Rodriguez: We needed to get everybody in government to put their big boy pants on and provide the authorities that we needed.
Jose Rodriguez: Big boy pants. Let me tell you, I had had a lot of experience in the agency where we had been left to hold the bag. And I was not about to let that happen for the people that work for me.
Lesley Stahl: There wasn't gonna be any deniability on this one?
Jose Rodriguez: There was not gonna be any deniability. And I tell you something.  In August of 2002, I felt I had all the authorities that I needed, all the approvals that I needed. The atmosphere in the country was different.  Everybody wanted us to save American lives.
The authorities came from the Justice Department in an opinion, later dubbed one of ""the torture memos"" - that detailed what was permissible.
Jose Rodriguez: We went to the border of legality.  We went to the border, but that was within legal bounds.
Lesley Stahl: Even after you got the Justice Department legal office to give you this okay, you kept going back and back, with each thing you did. Over and over.
Jose Rodriguez: We wanted to make sure that the rest of government was with us.
Lesley Stahl: How does the water boarding that you engaged in, how did that work?
Jose Rodriguez: The detainee was strapped to an inclined board with his feet up so that no water would go--
Lesley Stahl: So his head was back.
Jose Rodriguez: So his head was back. And a cloth was placed over the mouth and nose. And water was applied to it.
Lesley Stahl: Oh he couldn't breathe through his nose.
Jose Rodriguez: So when he was saturated, then the air flow would be stopped.
Lesley Stahl: And he'd have the sensation of drowning.
Jose Rodriguez: And he would have the sensation.
Lesley Stahl: And was he naked?
Jose Rodriguez: In many cases, nudity was used extensively. And it worked well.
Jose Rodriguez: It is effective because a lot of people feel very vulnerable when they're nude. And also because of the culture. Nudity, it is not something that is common.
Each step they took was specifically spelled out in the Justice Department memo.  For instance, uncooperative detainees could be put in a small, dark: ""cramped confinement box with an insect"" in it. As for waterboarding, the interrogators were allowed to pour water for up to 40 seconds at a time... quote applied ""from a height of 12 to 24 inches""... using about a liter of water per session.
Lesley Stahl: Oh, you had rules for each thing?
Jose Rodriguez: Yes, we had rules.  And not only that, but every time we did any of this, we had to ask permission.  The field had to ask permission of headquarters.
After Abu Zubaydah was subjected to the CIA's menu of interrogation techniques, Jose Rodriguez says he became compliant in less than three weeks.
Lesley Stahl: Was it waterboarding that broke the dam with Abu Zubaydah?
Jose Rodriguez: I think he was more taken aback by the insult slap.
Jose Rodriguez: It's just slapping somebody with an open hand so that you don't hurt 'em.
Lesley Stahl: By ""hurt,"" you mean you don't break his jaw?
Jose Rodriguez: We don't break his jaw. And the objective is not to inflict pain. The objective is to let him know there's a new sheriff in town, and he better pay attention.
Jose Rodriguez: Uh-huh. There was a technique where the detainee would sit on the floor and would raise his hands over his head.
Lesley Stahl: In other words, he had to hold his hands up there forever and ever, right?
Jose Rodriguez: Forever & ever? I was thinkin' about this the other day. The objective was to induce muscle fatigue, and most people who work out do a lot more fatiguing of the muscles.
Lesley Stahl: Are you saying this was like going to the gym? Come on.
Central to the interrogation was sleep deprivation.  Abu Zubaydah was also kept awake for three straight days.
Jose Rodriguez: Sleep deprivation works. I'm sure, Lesley, with all the traveling that you do, that you have suffered from jet lag. And you know, when you don't get a good night's sleep for two, three days, it's very hard.
Lesley Stahl: Now, you don't really mean to suggest that it's like jet lag. I mean, you make it sound like it's benign when you say stuff like that.
Jose Rodriguez: Well, I mean, the feeling--
Lesley Stahl: And you go into the gym and jet lag--
Jose Rodriguez: Well, the feeling that you get when you don't sleep.
Lesley Stahl: But I mean, these were enhanced interrogation techniques. Other people call it torture. This was-- this wasn't benign in any-- any sense of the word.
Jose Rodriguez: I'm not trying to say that they were benign. But the problem is here is that people don't understand that this program was not about hurting anybody. This program was about instilling a sense of hopelessness and despair on the terrorist, on the detainee, so that he would conclude on his own that he was better off cooperating with us.
He says once Abu Zubaydah became compliant, the harsh treatment stopped and he became a fountain of information.  But the FBI interrogators remember it differently.
Lesley Stahl: In fact, what they say is everything important that he gave up, he gave up to them before the harsher interrogation techniques kicked in.
Jose Rodriguez: Well, that is just not true.  It's not true.
Lesley Stahl: Well, now they say that.  And you say, ""It's not true.""  What am I supposed to think?  I don't know.
The FBI and CIA disagree and it's impossible for us to resolve the argument because details of the interrogations remain classified. But what about the fact that detainees will say anything to stop the pain.
Lesley Stahl: Here's something that was told to me. Abu Zubaydah's stories sent the CIA around the globe. Not a single plot was foiled. We spent millions chasing phantoms.
Jose Rodriguez: Bullshit. He gave us a road map that allowed us to capture a bunch of Al Qaeda senior leaders.
Among those leaders: Khalid Sheik Mohammed.  Details of his interrogation and what he told the CIA. About Osama bin Laden, next.
The CIA had the use of a fleet of special aircraft to spirit detainees to its web of black sites across the globe. They were knocked out with sedatives during the flights and upon arrival had their heads and beards shaved and they were placed in sterile underground cells, with only an arrow painted on the floor pointing to Mecca.
In total, the CIA picked up about 100 detainees, subjected 75 of them to harsh interrogation techniques - three of them to waterboarding, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed - or KSM, the mastermind of 9/11. When KSM was first captured in 2003, he was in no mood to talk.
Jose Rodriguez: Oh, he was not going to talk. I mean, Khalid Sheik Mohammed is one of the toughest killers out there.
Jose Rodriguez: He was brilliant.  He was scary smart. But he's also evil. And he will use that intelligence to define different ways of coming after us.
He says that in the beginning, KSM would respond to questions by reciting verses from the Koran.
Jose Rodriguez:  He eventually told us, ""Well look, I will talk once I get to New York and I get my lawyer."" He knew that if he got into the criminal process in the U. S. that he would get a lawyer and he would use that forum.
Lesley Stahl: He'd use it as a platform for his ideology.
Jose Rodriguez: He would use it as a platform.
Faced with KSM's obstinance, CIA interrogators began ratcheting up the severity of the questioning step-by-step.
Lesley Stahl: Did you make him wear diapers?
Jose Rodriguez: Diapers? I don't recall specifically to him. But diapers is something that is approved.
According to an internal investigation by the CIA's own inspector general - this is a heavily redacted declassified copy. KSM was denied sleep for 180 hours in a row or about seven and a half days. And still he didn't break.
Jose Rodriguez: He was the toughest detainee that we had. No doubt.
So he was subjected to waterboarding, specifically 183 ""pourings"" of water in about half a dozen separate sessions.  Jose Rodriguez said the average pour lasted 10 seconds.
Jose Rodriguez: Can I say something about Khalid Sheikh Mohammed? He's the one that was responsible for the death of Danny Pearl, the Wall Street reporter. He slit his throat in front of a camera. I don't know what type of man it takes to cut the throat of someone in front of you like that, but I can tell you that this is an individual who probably didn't give a rat's ass about having water poured on his face.
Lesley Stahl: He never believed for one second you were going to kill him.
Jose Rodriguez: No. And let me just tell you. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed would use his fingers to count the number of seconds, because he knew that in all likelihood, we would stop at 10.  So this doesn't sound like a person who is afraid of dying.
Lesley Stahl: If he's sitting there counting off, he knows you're not going to kill him.  He knows he's not going to drown.  Then why do it?  What's the point?
Jose Rodriguez: Well, I think that the cumulative effect of waterboarding and sleep deprivation and everything else that was done eventually got to him.
Lesley Stahl: So what happens? Does he break down? Does he weep? Does he fall apart?
Jose Rodriguez: No. He gets a good night's sleep. He gets his Ensure.  By the way, he was very heavy when he came to us and he lost 50 pounds. So--
Lesley Stahl: What his Ensure? You mean like people in the hospital who drink that stuff?
Jose Rodriguez: Yes. Dietary manipulation was part of these-- our techniques.
Lesley Stahl: So sleep deprivation, dietary manipulation. I mean, this is Orwellian stuff. The United States doesn't do that.
Jose Rodriguez: Well, we do.
The question is whether the information they got from KSM was truthful and helpful.  In his report, the CIA's inspector general says that the CIA's office of medical services concluded that when it came to the waterboarding--
Lesley Stahl: There was no reason to think that it had been effective or that it was safe. This is your inspector general.
Jose Rodriguez: Well our own inspector general in many cases did very sloppy work. That report is flawed in many different ways.
Lesley Stahl: Why would they make it up?
Jose Rodriguez: I don't know if it's made up. I don't know if they were advocates.  You know, the inspector general himself, he was opposed to this.  I mean, but this was the policy.  So he was wrong.
But many of the tips from detainees reportedly led to blind alleys and expensive wild goose chases. Jose Rodriguez maintains the information from KSM and the other detainees enabled the CIA to disrupt at least 10 large scale terrorist plots.
Lesley Stahl: Would the plots have been stopped without the harsh interrogation techniques? In other words, could it have happened without waterboarding?
Jose Rodriguez: I can't answer that question. Perhaps. But the issue here was timing.  We needed information and we needed it right away to protect the homeland.
Lesley Stahl: You told us that the whole rationale, justification for the whole interrogation program was to stop an imminent attack. The inspector general says it didn't stop any imminent attack.
Jose Rodriguez: I submit to you that we don't know. We don't know if, for example, al Qaeda would have been able to continue on with their anthrax program or nuclear program or the second wave of attacks or the sleeper agents that they had inside the United States that were working with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to take down the Brooklyn Bridge, for example. So, it's easy, years later, to say, ""Well, you know, no ticking time bomb-- nothing was stopped.""
Lesley Stahl: But the truth is about Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, you really didn't break him.
Jose Rodriguez: Why?  Why do you say that?
Lesley Stahl: Well, he didn't tell you about Osama bin Laden.  He didn't tell you how to get him.  He didn't tell you how to find him.
Jose Rodriguez: Some of these people were not going to tell us everything.
Jose Rodriguez: There is a limit, there is a limit to what they will tell us.
Actually KSM lied about the courier - whose identity finally led to the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the terrorist leader he calls Sheikh bin Laden was hiding.
Lesley Stahl: Now, here's what I heard: that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told you the courier had retired and threw you off the scent for a while.
Jose Rodriguez: That was the one secret he was going to take to the grave, and that was the protection of the Sheikh. He was not going to tell us.
One of the secrets Jose Rodriguez had hoped to take to his grave was exposed in 2007: the CIA had videotaped the interrogation of two of its detainees, including Abu Zubaydah.
Jose Rodriguez: The reason why we taped Abu Zubaydah was because we-- he was very wounded when he was captured. And we feared that he was gonna die in captivity. So we wanted to show the world that we actually had nothing to do with his death. That you know, he died on his own.
Lesley Stahl: Well, that's ironic. You wanted to have a video record that he was being well treated, but in the end they became-- a video record that he had been subjected to these harsh techniques.
Lesley Stahl: But you then ordered these tapes destroyed.
Lesley Stahl: Ninety-two tapes. Why did you order that they be destroyed?
Jose Rodriguez: To protect the people who worked for me and who were at those black sites and whose faces were shown on the tape.
Lesley Stahl: Protect them from what?
Jose Rodriguez: Protect them from al Qaeda ever getting their hands on these tapes and using them to go after them and their families.
He was also worried about the very survival of the CIA's dark side, the Clandestine Service because of the so-called Abu Ghraib effect.
Jose Rodriguez: I was concerned that the distinction between a legally-authorized program as our enhanced interrogation program was, and illegal activity by a bunch of psychopaths would not be made.
He says that CIA lawyers repeatedly asked the White House, Justice Department and Vice President Cheney's office for permission to shred the tapes.  But--
Jose Rodriguez: Nobody was making a decision to proceed.
Lesley Stahl: So one day you just said, ""The hell with it.  I have this authority.  I'm going to do it.""
Jose Rodriguez: One day I finally called in my advisers and lawyers and say: ""Tell me, ok.  Tell me again that this is legal.  And tell me that I have the authority to do this.""  When the answer I received was ""yes"" and ""yes,"" then I said, ""Well, I am going to make this decision, and do it myself.""
They were destroyed in an industrial-strength shredder.
Lesley Stahl: Here's what you write in your book. You took the president's, the vice president's silence on this to mean they were really relieved that you had taken this on yourself and had done it. That's what you write.
Lesley Stahl: There are people who feel what you did it as a coverup.
Jose Rodriguez: Everything that was on those tapes were authorized activities by the U. S. government.  So there was nothing to cover up.
Yet after the story broke in the newspapers, the Justice Department launched a criminal investigation.  Ultimately, Jose Rodriguez was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing.  By then the CIA's inspector general's report was partly declassified, detailing some of the program's excesses.
Lesley Stahl: People told that, that you were gonna go and hurt their children, rape their wives.
Jose Rodriguez: Stupid things that were done by people who had no authority to do that.
Lesley Stahl: And they just took it on themselves.
Jose Rodriguez: Correct. And we found out about it and we self-reported, and actually called in the I. G. and said, ""You better take a look at what these people did and do what you need to do.""
Lesley Stahl: You have some people out there who were taken to black sites. They were subjected to terrible treatment.  And they hadn't done anything. I mean they were taken mistakenly. They disappeared. What about them?
Jose Rodriguez: No doubt when you are involved in complicated covert action programs like this one, that some mistakes will be made.
Jose Rodriguez retired from the CIA in January 2008.  He has spent the last year writing his book, published by the CBS company Simon and Schuster.  In the book he says that by cancelling the interrogation program, President Obama has tied the government's hands in the war on terror.
Jose Rodriguez: We don't capture anybody any more, Lesley. You know their default option of this Administration has been to kill all prisoners.  Take no prisoners.
Jose Rodriguez: The drones. How could it be more ethical to kill people rather than capture them. I never understood that one.
Lesley Stahl: President Obama has said that what we did was torture.
Jose Rodriguez: Well, President Obama is entitled to his opinion. When President Obama condemns the covert action activities of a previous government, he is breaking the covenant that exists between intelligence officers who are at the pointy end of the spear, hanging way out there, and the government that authorized them and directed them to go there.
Lesley Stahl: John McCain. A huge critic of this program. He had been tortured, so we know where he's coming from. Here's what he said: ""It's killing us that America will sink to the level of its worst enemies.  We forfeited our values,"" he said.  And I guess what I wanna ask is, didn't it actually change who we are? What we think we're about?  I mean, we think we-- we're the country that doesn't do that. Right?
Jose Rodriguez: I am very secure in, in what we did and I am very confident that what we did saved American lives.
This Tuesday is the one-year anniversary of the U. S. Special Forces raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.",0

"It’s no secret that airlines don’t care too much (or at all) about helping customers make informed decisions. But have you ever felt like you’re up against their unspoken rules — or airfare gotchas?
In the confusing world of travel booking, there are plenty of airfare mistakes you could make to benefit the carrier — ones that can spike your overall cost, or make traveling more difficult. You can blame some of these pitfalls on the fine print, but others are simply the stupid airfare gotchas we’ve all fallen into. Here are 11 to watch out for.
Think you got a great deal? Hidden fees — especially popular among budget airlines that love airfare gotchas — can inflate costs quickly. Bringing a bag, forgetting in-flight food, choosing a seat and even printing your boarding pass can cost you a lot on no-frills airlines like Spirit, Allegiant and WOW. Make sure you know what’s included in the fare price, and hold off on paying fees until you determine there’s no other option.
For example, if the airline requires you to pay for selecting a seat closer to your travel companion on a long-haul flight (like TAP recently expected me to), wait until you arrive at the airport and simply ask at the customer service desk if you can change your seat. Unless the flight is completely full, you’ll typically be able to move your seat assignment without paying a penny.
When major airlines American, Delta and United recently introduced basic economy fares, alleging to save you money by stripping basic amenities like overhead bin space or seat-choosing privileges, they expected budget-conscious travelers to jump for joy. But, lately, more are scratching their heads. Delta’s president said recently that travelers might avoid basic economy “when they see exactly what it is.” As SmarterTravel’s Tim Winship points out: Delta seems to be acknowledging that what is and isn’t included in the basic economy price is unclear to travelers.
More: Basic economy: Are the savings worth it?
Even worse, booking sites can sometimes group basic economy seats in with the regular economy fares, making it easy for you to mistakenly book a basic seat (often for not much less) even if you know the difference. Kayak now highlights differing types of economy fares in its air searches, but not all booking platforms have caught up. Make sure you’re able to differentiate between basic and regular economy fares on the search site you use. If not, booking directly on the airline’s site is a safer bet for clearer seat options.
More: Basic economy: What it's like in airlines' cheapest seats
Booking airfare on multiple airlines for back-to-back legs might seem like a good idea if it’s the cheapest option, but you lose a lot of power should you miss a flight on a multi-airline itinerary. Normally, missing a connection due to the airline’s timing is no problem — the airline will rebook you, no questions asked. However, if you miss a flight with a separate carrier, the airline at fault for your missing the connecting flight has no responsibility (or power) to rebook you. You’ll likely have to pay a rebooking fee, and will lose what few consumer rights you have when the airline is at fault.
More: Fliers' rights: You have fewer than you think
Impulsive travelers, beware. Pouncing on other modes of completing a leg of your journey (i.e. train, bus or boat) is only a worthwhile adventure if you’re not skipping an onward flight. This is another one of those fine-print airfare gotchas: Airline terms and conditions establish that your airfare is only valid so long as you show up for your reservation. If you miss a leg of the trip and don’t contact the airline about rebooking, it can cancel the rest of your itinerary to give your seat to someone else. You could end up paying a rebooking fee, or needing to book an entirely new reservation if the airline can’t accommodate you on short notice.
Before you book with an online travel agent, check the price on the airline’s website. As with most services, a third-party seller is wont to charge you more. Use a widely trusted search engine like Google Flights, Kayak or TripAdvisor that will show you the airline’s price, or will take you directly to the airline for booking.
A sly trick that airlines seem to enjoy is the non-stop vs. direct guessing game to test your airfare gotchas knowledge. “Non-stop” and “direct” both sound like you won’t be experiencing a connection, but the latter actually means your plane will land to drop off and pick up passengers — which can take up a lot of your precious time. This may or may not make a difference in your travel planning, but making a rule of booking only non-stop flights will at least mean you don’t ever wake up mid-flight and frantically ask your seat partner why the plane is landing.
Don’t put on blinders when choosing a destination airport. Yes, you probably know what city you’re flying into — but do you know how many airports the city has, and which one is the best option for your preferred airline or time schedule? Make sure that your flight search is narrowed only to the general city you’re visiting, not to a single airport.
For example, when booking a flight to Washington, D. C., flight search engines should list “WAS (all airports),” in addition to the three separate airports in the D.C. area: Dulles, Reagan National and Baltimore-Washington International. It would be unwise to assume you should select the one with “Washington” in its name, especially since, in this case, Reagan National in Virginia is the closest option to the city.
A golden rule in travel and in life: If an airline owes you something, hold them to it. The simplest way to do this is to enroll in rewards programs with every new airline you fly, and use the points you rack up. You don’t need elite status or a travel credit card to get money off flights here and there — simply keep tabs of your miles and use them where you can. It would be the airline’s dream for you to forget about what is essentially free money lying around.
Buying too early (or too late)
Too many airlines — and even some travel experts — champion the cause of “buying early” to get the best deal. But, “early” means different things to different people, while the window of optimal time for buying cheap airfare is surprisingly narrow. On average, seven to eight weeks is the optimal amount of advance time to buy your airfare. So, if your idea of “early” is six months, you’re probably going to end up paying a premium.
Airfare starts at sky-high rates and comes down as the date approaches — until demand picks up, usually a little less than two months before the flight. Buying well before (or after) that window will usually cost you.
Clearing your cookies, or search history, is a good habit to have as you browse bookings, research suggests. This fact is considered by some to be a myth, or at least an unsupported claim — but it turns out there is some truth to it when it comes to hotels, so it could potentially be among the pesky airfare gotchas out there as well.
Northeastern University researchers have found that some popular hotel booking sites present slightly cheaper results to users without any hotel search history stored — though only by an average of about $12 to $15 dollars. Still, why not simply clear your history every now and then if it might save you a few bucks?
Have you read up on airlines’ terms and conditions, or studied public passenger rights laws and agreements? Probably not, but knowing what you’re entitled to is often the only way the airline will give it to you.
Luckily, we did the research for you and created a guide to lost baggage refunds, reimbursement for getting bumped, airline contracts, government-enforced passenger rights, and more. Download and print our Passenger Rights Guide fold-up card to keep your rights in your pocket and avoid airfare gotchas.

"Americans are expected to fire up their credit cards this holiday season, spending hundreds of billions of dollars over the two last months of the year. But how safe are these transactions?
Following a year of data breaches at many well-known retailers and eateries, consumers clearly have cause for concern. Dave DeWalt, CEO of cybersecurity company FireEye, recently told ""60 Minutes"" that while most large companies are spending more on security, ""97 percent of all companies are getting breached.""
In 2007, the parent company of TJ Maxx and Marshalls disclosed that hackers had stolen data involving more than 45 million cards. And last year -- one week before Christmas -- news broke that hackers had stolen 40 million credit cards from big box retailer Target.
Since then a number of other well-known retailers and eateries, including Home Depot, Michaels, Neiman Marcus and P. F. Chang's, have been hit by hackers.
""Most often what we're seeing in these cases is that it's organized cybercriminals,"" John Breyault of the National Consumers League told CBS MoneyWatch. ""They are breaking into companies' networks. They're scooping up tens of thousands, in some cases like the Target case, tens of millions of consumer credit cards.""
According to Breyault, there is a network of cybercriminal markets online and what experts call the ""dark web.""
""These are forums where cybercriminals go, and it's much like any other market place. They advertise cards or identity information that they may have stolen and have available for sale,"" he explained. ""The methods that you're seeing most often in the media these days are called point-of-sale attacks. These are the terminals that consumers use when they swipe their card. Those networks are connected to the Internet, you have hackers who are breaking in to those networks.""
As sneaky as thieves can be in stealing credit card information, consumers can do a lot to protect themselves simply by exercising a little common sense.
First, diligently check your credit and debit statements over the holidays and immediately contest any suspect charges. And one way to avoid fraud in the first place is to shop only on sites offering secure, encrypted transactions.
Also be on guard against scams that ""spoof"" major retailers, by verifying that ""https"" appears in the URL. Don't click on any links you don't recognize, especially if they're from an unknown source, and never disclose your credit card information -- online or over the phone -- unless you know who you're doing business with.
Use your smartphone to shop online or conduct other financial activities? Make sure your mobile devices are password- or fingerprint-protected. That reduces the chance of losing confidential data if your phone falls into the wrong hands. Your phone also should be equipped with security software, just like a desktop computer.
Breyault has an additional nugget of advice for consumers hitting stores this season holiday season, and beyond: Use a credit, not a debit, card. Consumers have virtually no liability for fraud on purchases made with a credit card as long as a suspicious transaction is reported promptly, he said. Protections are much weaker for debit cards.
""On a debit card... if your debit card is used fraudulently, those funds may not be available to you while the bank investigates that,"" Breyault said. ""That can be important for consumers who need those funds, for example, to pay bills or things like that. Typically what we tell consumers that you're better off using your card, if you're concerned about fraud, than using a debit card.""",0

"t feels both apt and unlikely that Tim Key should make a show about dating. Apt, because flirtation is integral to his standup style. A Key gig is like a game of cat-and-mouse with the audience: he teases, he makes eyes, he shows a flash of what we want then snatches it away. Improbable, because dating is the stuff of a hundred standup shows, and Key has never been a man to tread the beaten path. Yet here he is, telling the tale of a dream first date and a desperate morning after, a lonely schlub’s traipse across London to claw victory from the jaws of romantic defeat.
That story furnishes the backbone to Megadate, the first solo set in three years from the Alan Partridge sidekick and recent West End theatre star. After a couple of big-hitting, high concept shows, in which Key shared the stage with a working bath, a double bed and a dancer, Megadate takes him back to basics, insofar as any Key show was basic in the first place. It’s the combination that won him the 2009 Edinburgh Comedy award: sly standup, haiku-style comic verses, and wistful black-and-white films on an upstage screen. And it works a treat.
Better, I’d say, than its predecessor Single White Slut, which had a coup de theatre going for it, but an air of insubstantiality, too. Megadate is a beefier affair, with its seductive if slender love story reinforced by bulletins from Key’s life as a middle-aged singleton marooned on a career plateau.
It starts with Key chucking a shopping bag on to the stage. Tins of Kronenbourg spill out; Key enters, in suit and tie, all feline self-delight, then pops a can and douses himself in frothing beer. Is he suave? Is he a bum? The signifiers are all scrambled. There’s a tension between high-status manner and low-status behaviour that’s inherently comic, never more so than when Key narrates a solo trip to the bowling alley. Listen to what he’s saying – the jug of Grolsch at 10am, the unconventional sportswear – and it sounds like a breakdown. The way he tells it, it sounds like a lap of honour.
In fact, it’s just one station on his personal Via Dolorosa across the capital, retracing the steps he took on last night’s date, sending text messages by the score to his new sweetheart. But answer comes there none. How many are you allowed to send, he asks the audience, playfully assuming an endorsement that we never quite give to his misfit antics, whether that’s cheating at the gym, requiring his date to read his CV, or cooking two meals at a time – a tasty one to eat, a healthy one to photograph and show to his personal trainer.
Key gets a laugh at the mere mention of a trainer, which (we assume) isn’t his style. But the Key depicted here isn’t the high-rolling hipster of yesteryear. The beard has gone, the hair is flecked with grey. His mum wants more grandchildren (“Greedy, Carol!”) and being single doesn’t feel all that young and free. Of course, Key being Key, this portrait of disappointed early midlife comes thickly hedged in irony: the show is more arch than a Roman aqueduct. But it’s a great story for his style of comedy, the sadsackery contrasting nicely with his self-satisfied delivery, just as the florid and the base mingle so productively (“I tore her myriad new ones”) in his terminology.
There’s some lovely phrasemaking here, in and beyond his actual poems. They serve mainly as punctuation – and their recurring themes of discord and disconnection complement Key’s failing-romance plot. But there are choice formulations wherever you look, from the “rarefied ribbons of gouda” his date carves at the cheese course, to his description of Olympian Greg Rutherford as “the long jumper – to put it mildly”. The oddball, indie-movie atmosphere is stoked by a soundtrack ranging from chanson to east European folk and beyond. (One of the show’s funniest routines fantasises Key’s future appearance on Desert Island Discs.) Then there are the films, gnomic visual poems in which our unmoored hero plays Poohsticks off Tower Bridge or takes a wet shave on a tower block roof.
There’s a catharsis of sorts, as Key’s pestering texts are finally answered, from the other side of a Mariah Carey waxwork in Madame Tussauds. I detected an echo of Key’s sometime sparring partner and fellow comic storyteller Daniel Kitson here, as this tale of loneliness and disconnection is made good. But Key has a style all his own, and he’s in thrilling command of it in Megadate. He’s gone bowling alone in the name of our entertainment, and he’s scored a pretty resounding double strike.

"The U. K.’s opposition Labour Party wants Britain to stay in the European Union’s single market for an extended period after it leaves the bloc, a shift in its position that could undermine Prime Minister Theresa May’s efforts to deliver her vision of Brexit.
The proposal, which would mean no additional customs or migration controls in March 2019, would allow more time to finalize details of the U. K.’s departure, and give government and business time to prepare, Labour’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said. It would also eliminate the need to negotiate a transitional arrangement at the same time as a final deal.
“There would be no need to set up complex alternative customs or trading relations,” Starmer wrote in the Observer newspaper on Sunday. “It is a grown-up acknowledgment that bespoke transitional arrangements are highly unlikely to be negotiated, agreed and established in the next 18 months.”
If Labour can force a Parliamentary vote in support of its position, it will put pressure on Conservative lawmakers who oppose leaving the single market to fall in behind it. Legislation that seeks to prepare Britain for leaving the EU returns next month to Parliament, where May doesn’t have a majority, and lawmakers are expected to battle over amendments.
Starmer was clear that Labour remains committed to implementing Brexit. He also said his party wanted to see a final settlement that allowed the U. K. “more effective management of migration” -- something that would make permanent membership of the single market difficult. And he emphasized that he saw the transition as time-limited. “It cannot become a kind of never-ending purgatory,” he said.
Instead, he said Labour remained open to “negotiating a new single market relationship” or “working up from a bespoke trade deal.”
Some Labour lawmakers are pressing for more than that. A new group, Labour Campaign For The Single Market, will launch on Tuesday, pushing to get the party policy changed to supporting continued single market membership. Business leaders overwhelmingly support continued single-market membership, while several prominent Conservative lawmakers have defied May to speak publicly of their support for ongoing single-market membership.
The shift in Labour’s policy comes as the U. K. prepares for another round of negotiations in Brussels on Monday, which EU officials have signaled are unlikely to yield much progress. Brexit Secretary David Davis will ask his EU counterpart Michel Barnier to use ""imagination"" and flexibility to allow talks to move forward, as EU officials remain doubtful that enough progress will have been made by October to move on to trade talks.
While the round of negotiations kicking-off in Brussels this week will be technical, the U. K is hoping to proceed to discussions mapping out the future relationship with the EU as soon as possible, Davis’s office said.While the U.K. said neither side should ""drag its feet"" with the deadline for exit set for March 2019, May’s decision to call an election last June means months of negotiation time has already been lost.
The European Commission has warned that Britain must first settle its so-called divorce bill, resolve the issue of EU citizens’ rights and find a workable solution for the Northern Irish border before taking discussions further. A senior EU official on Friday downplayed the chance of any major progress this week in key areas such as the bill.
While even Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Friday acknowledged some payment would have to be made to the bloc -- after saying a month ago the EU could ""go whistle"" if it expected Britain to pay -- the two sides haven’t even agreed how to calculate the bill. While the EU isn’t demanding the U. K. signs up to a specific amount at this stage, it does want it to agree soon on a methodology for reaching the final figure. German Chancellor Angela Merkel reminded Britain on Saturday that it had to settle its dues.
Davis and Barnier will meet to formally open talks, and officials will then hold working groups to discuss technical details behind each side’s proposals, Davis’s office said. Davis and Barnier will then close negotiations on Thursday.",0

Maryland mother Ruth Scully was confronted with one of the worst nightmares a parent can face. It started when her two-year-old son Nolan couldn’t fight off a stuffy nose. At first they thought it was just the sniffles, but it kept getting worse until he could barely breathe. Then a CAT scan showed the terrible truth: Nolan, who was now three, had rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare and very aggressive form of cancer.
It soon became clear that Nolan’s days were numbered. He fought bravely but in vain. After a year and a half, Nolan died in his mother’s arms. In her struggle to come to terms with his loss, she shared her grief in a moving post on Facebook. She described the last hours after the medical staff explained how bad things were:
“The Mestatic Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma was spreading like wild fire. She explained at this time she didn’t feel his Cancer was treatable as it had become resistant to all treatment options we had tried and the plan would be to keep him comfortable as he was deteriorating rapidly.
After a while, I composed myself and went into Nolan’s room. He was sitting in ‘Mommy’s Red Chair’ watching YouTube on his Tablet. I sat down with him and put my head up against his and had the following conversation:
Me: Poot, it hurts to breathe doesn’t it?
Nolan: Weeeelll…. yeah.
Me: You’re in a lot of pain aren’t you baby?
Nolan: (looking down) Yeah.
Me: Poot, this Cancer stuff sucks. You don’t have to fight anymore.
Nolan: (Pure Happiness) I DONT??!! But I will for you Mommy!!
Me: No Poot!! Is that what you have been doing?? Fighting for Mommy??
Nolan: Well DUH!!
Me: Nolan Ray, what is Mommy’s job?
Nolan: To keep me SAFE! (With a big grin)
Me: Honey … I can’t do that anymore here. The only way I can keep you safe is in Heaven. (My heart shattering)
Nolan: Sooooo I’ll just go to Heaven and play until you get there! You’ll come right?
Me: Absolutely!! You can’t get rid of Mommy that easy!!
Nolan: Thank you Mommy!!! I’ll go play with Hunter and Brylee and Henry!!
The next day he was resting, as he slept most of the days after. We had Hospice on board, all his IV medications, even his DNR signed. (I cannot explain to you what signing an Emergency Responder ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ order for your angelic son feels like. ) When he woke up we had the van packed and I had his shoes in my hand to take him home for the evening. We just wanted ONE more night together. But as he woke, he gently put his hand on mine and said ‘Mommy, it’s ok. Let’s just stay here ok?’ My 4 year old Hero was trying to make sure things were easy for me….
About 9:00pm …I asked Nolan if I could get in the shower, as I was not allowed to leave him and Mommy had to be touching him at all times. He said ‘Ummmm ok Mommy. Have Uncle Chris come sit with me and I’ll turn this way so I can see you.’ I stood at the bathroom door, turned to him and said ‘Keep looking right here Poot, I’ll be out in two seconds.’ He smiled at me. I shut the bathroom door. They said the moment the bathroom door clicked he shut his eyes and went into a deep sleep, beginning the end of life passing.
When I opened the bathroom door, his Team was surrounding his bed and every head turned and looked at me with tears in their eyes. They said ‘Ruth, he’s in a deep sleep. He can’t feel anything.’ His respirations were extremely labored, his right lung had collapsed and his oxygen dropped.
I ran and jumped into bed with him and put my hand on the right side of his face. Then a miracle that I will never forget happened….
My angel took a breath, opened his eyes, smiled at me and said ‘I Love You Mommy,’ turned his head towards me and at 11:54 pm Sgt. Rollin Nolan Scully passed away as I was singing ‘You are My Sunshine’ in his ear.
He woke up out of a coma to say he loved me with a smile on his face!”
This moving experience has touched people’s hearts all over the world. When mothers call their little tykes “angel,” this story shares some key insight as to what they mean. Children have hidden depths and big hearts.
Ruth was so courageous to share these moments — of this beautiful boy, her great loss, and the incredible love between a mother and child.

These “peace loving” men had a few schemes going on at their multiple convenience stores. They would buy cigarettes in St. Louis which has a low tax on cigarettes and distribute them to areas that have high taxes, such as Chicago and New Jersey. They would also sell the substance known as K2, which is a synthetic type of Marijuana that is sold commercially as incense but is currently illegal in the state of Missouri since August of 2010. That’s the same kind of drug the man who rammed all those people in Times Square last week was on.
The most troubling fact federal investigators found here wasn’t the actual selling of illegal substances or the tax scheme these people perpetrated. It was the fact these men were laundering the money they were getting. Anytime we hear about any Muslim laundering money the first thought which should come to our minds is “Where is that money going?”
Central Intelligence Reports of the rise of Isis:
ISIS’s criminal activities have made it the most-funded terrorist group in history. The accumulation of its sizable wealth has allowed the group to increase its operational scope, attain weapons and resources and recruit local and foreign fighters.
The multifaceted and dangerous relationship ISIS has cultivated for each fundraising method has been exceptionally calculated and profitable. Through the exploitation of known smuggling routes on Turkey’s border, it has used the black market to sell oil, natural resources and looted goods. Similarly, the group has profited from banks lacking in sanctions and wire controls of laundered money and illegally donated funds.
Recently, at the International Conference on Peace and Security in Iraq, the main topic was ensuring all United Nations members are strictly abiding by Security Council Resolution 2170, which calls for all countries to ensure their companies and civilians are prohibiting terrorist financing. It also calls for countries to implement effective sanction programs that encompass social media technologies since statistics point to money flowing through tools such as, but not limited to, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp and Twitter.
If countries in the Middle East strengthen their money-laundering policies and police efforts for black-market trade, they may begin to put a small dent in ISIS’s efforts to amass its fortune.
These facts are truly terrifying and prove we need to be more vigilant than ever.
Muslims tend to use money laundering schemes to fund their Jihad terrorism both foreign and domestically. This is one of the main reasons why immediately after 9/11 President George W. Bush made it a priority to make it easier for the FBI, CIA and other agencies to all work together in fighting terrorism. By having them share intel with each other instead of only working independently as they mostly did before the 9/11 attacks.

"(CNN) — What exactly is Australian food?
While locals dine on fried rice, Thai curries, Mediterranean cuisine and the like, those dishes don't really belong to Australia. They're part of multicultural Australia but are often claimed by other nations.
Apart from the homegrown kangaroo -- and perhaps the now-American-owned Vegemite -- there must be others. Some are cliched, some are obvious, some may surprise. But Australia's culinary history can lay claim to these 40 Australian food items (with a few Sydney-area recommendations on where to get them).
40. Witchetty grubs
This nutty-tasting grub has been an indigenous mouthful of Australian food for centuries.
courtesy culinary madness
The most authentic of bush tucker, the grub is a nutty-flavored bite that has been enjoyed by indigenous Australians for thousands of years. The wider Australian nation has often struggled with eating it raw, but two facts remain -- it actually tastes good and it belongs to the land.
39. Anzac biscuits
Associated with Anzac Day on April 25, the biscuit is a crunchy commemoration of the members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who fought in World War I. It's Australian food with a back story.
The Anzac biscuit was made by wives during the war and sent to soldiers, because the basic ingredients (rolled oats, flour, sugar, desiccated coconut, golden syrup, butter, bicarbonate of soda and water) were able to keep for a long time, even on long boat journeys.

38. Emu
Emu actually has a few times the iron content of beef. It's virtually fat-free and is low in cholesterol. The Australian native animal works well when smoked and served cold or as a pizza topping. For a modern gourmet twist, have it in a pie made up of emu meat, smoked emu, feta cheese, red wine, sun-dried tomato, onion and Tasmanian black pepper -- all in a filo-pastry crust.

37. Macadamia nuts
The streets are lined with macadamia nuts around Byron Bay.

Native to eastern Australia, the macadamia nut is eaten raw or included in a variety of dishes. From breads to lamb roasts and cakes, this is a versatile nut. Pick some 'round Byron Bay during spring.
36. Damper
This iconic, cheap Australian food was the staple of road workers and bushies in days gone by. Originally it was the simplest of recipes. The soda bread is made from wheat flour, water and a pinch of salt, then baked in the coals of a campfire and paired nicely with billy tea or a swig of rum. Today it can be a little more fancy -- milk and self-raising flour.

35. Pea and ham soup
The perfect hearty winter meal that arguably has British origins, pea and ham soup is a simple offering that has been served up in farmhouse kitchens for decades. Add sliced frankfurters or smoked sausage to make it even more hearty.
34. Weet-Bix
How many do you eat? This high-fiber breakfast biscuit made from whole-grain wheat has been an Australian food favorite since 1930.
It's smaller, sweeter and more brick-like than the Weetabix that's found in other countries. Usually has a few Queensland bananas or strawberries or a spoonful of sugar mixed in. And, of course, milk. Aussie kids are Weet-Bix kids, says the brand's successful advertising jingle. Unless, of course, you're in New Zealand where, funnily enough, New Zealand kids are also Weet-Bix kids.
33. Lamingtons
This tasty cake can be found at most school fairs and is the pride of many a mother's kitchen.

The lamington is often referred to as the ""National Cake of Australia."" The National Trust of Queensland even named the lamington one of Australia's favorite icons. This square-shaped sponge cake is coated in a layer of chocolate icing and desiccated coconut. It sometimes comes in two halves with a layer of cream or jam in the middle. Found commonly throughout cafes as a perfect accompaniment to tea and coffee, it's also often baked for fundraisers.

Many a wandering son or daughter returns home for Sunday lunch when mum's cooking a lamb roast. It's the garlic, rosemary and olive oil that make this piece of meat delicious and tender. It's then served with enough baked potatoes to end any family feud. Though its origins may be beyond Australian borders, Aussies will proudly say only they know how to put on a good one.

If it's wrapped in yesterday's news, it's an Australian version of fish 'n' chips. The sun is out, the water's crisp and you're hungry. What to go for? Australia has some of the best seafood in the world and that means you're almost guaranteed fresh fish, served with salt and lemon, wrapped in yesterday's newspaper or white wrapping.

29. John Dory fillets
Found commonly in Australian waters including Sydney Harbour, John Dory is a popular fish variety in local cuisine. Battered and fried and served with chips, or pan-fried with herbed oil on a bed of mashed potato with salad, this is a versatile, meaty fish and popular Australian food.

28. Iced VoVo
When former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd mentioned Iced VoVo in his 2007 election speech, he single-handedly cemented the biscuit's place in Australian folklore.
The wheat-flour biscuit with a strip of pink fondant on either side of raspberry jam and sprinkled with coconut is a sweet, soft and crunchy mouthful. It's made by biscuit company Arnott's, an Australian food institution itself and now a subsidiary of U.S.-based Campbell Soup Company.
27. Barbecued snags

Nothing is more Australian than getting friends or family together for a barbecue. And at the heart of any good barbie is a selection of good Australian snags -- from the traditional pork or beef, to those flavored with herbs and spices from around the world.
There's something homey about a snag in a roll or a slice of bread covered in your favorite sauce, perhaps with some fried onion on top and some spuds on the side. A sausage sizzle put on outside the local hardware store on Sundays makes a bit of DIY that much more appealing.

25. Pavlova
Australians will tell you this belongs to the lucky country. Even when laced with kiwi fruit.
Vince Caligiuri/Getty Images
Australia and New Zealand have shared rivalries for years, and the pavlova's origin is another to add to the list. Both countries claim to have invented the dish in honor of Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova when she visited Australasia in the 1920s. No evidence conclusively substantiates either claim (unlike Crowded House, Phar Lap and Russell Crowe).
But even if it was finally proven once and for all to hail from New Zealand, Aussies would surely still label it Australian food. Pavlova is a popular meringue-based dessert that has a crisp crust and a soft, light inside. It's often decorated with whipped cream and fresh fruit and served at celebratory meals.

24. Prawn cocktail
A traditional seafood starter, this one is made up of shelled prawns in mayonnaise and tomato dressing, then served in a glass, sometimes with a lettuce leaf. It's famous the world over, but Australia really embraced the prawn cocktail as its own in the 1970s. It was almost the beginning of fine dining, Aussie style.

Yet another biscuit!

Arnott's (which produces Tim Tams) say that around 35 million packs are sold each year. That's 400 million biscuits at an average of 1.7 packs per Australian. The much-loved chocolate biscuit is made up of two layers of chocolate-malted biscuit, separated by a light chocolate filling and coated in melted chocolate. No wonder you can now find them in supermarkets around the world.
22. Dagwood dog
They say the show must go on, but it just can't without a dagwood dog. For many, when you say dagwood dog you think of the Sydney Royal Easter Show, because this frankfurter on a stick that is battered and deep-fried is found at most carnivals. With tomato sauce on top, of course.
21. Sausage rolls
Sausage meat wrapped in pastry and oven-baked is the lunch of choice for many Australians. Though many countries appreciate the taste of a good sausage roll, Australia leads the way in modern adaptations of the simple scoff. Here, culinary influences from around the world have been infused to create unique taste experiences and a genuine Australian food.

20. SAO biscuit
Founded as a charity biscuit, it used to be handed out by Salvation Army Officers (thus SAO). SAO is a light-textured square biscuit that's made by rolling dough into thin sheets, then cutting it into squares. It's often used to make a crispy sandwich by smearing on a layer of topping, such as Vegemite and butter.
For generations, the SAO sandwich has then been squeezed to create ""worms"" that pour out of the holes in the pastry, then eaten. It's kid's food as art.
19. Cherry Ripe
Australia's oldest chocolate bar is still one of its best-sellers. The Cherry Ripe consists of coconut and cherries smothered in Cadbury's Old Gold dark chocolate.
18. Fairy bread
Remember your childhood when nothing could beat a bit of fairy bread? Sliced white bread is cut into triangles, smeared with butter or margarine and covered in hundreds-and-thousands, which sticks to the bread for a bright and multicolored treat. A staple at kids parties. And easy to make, following the oh-so simple instructions above.
17. Chicken parmigiana
An Italian name, but a bona fide Australian pub classic, the parmigiana started as an eggplant dish in Italy and has since evolved into a chicken schnitzel topped with an Italian-inspired tomato sauce and melted cheese. A perfect marriage.
Sometimes it will also be topped with ham or prosciutto. Usually comes with a beer on ""parma night"" at the local pub. Another wonderful union.

16. Pigs in a blanket
The perfect accompaniment to any roast dinner. In the United States, the term often refers to hot dogs or sausages wrapped in dough or even a pancake. But in Australia it's all about wrapping meat in more meat -- a double meat sandwich without bread.
15. Chiko roll
This Australian food icon was inspired by Chinese spring rolls. The deep-fried snack contains beef (despite its name, there's no chicken), celery, cabbage, barley, carrot, onion, green beans and spices in a battered tube. Probably some offal, too.
Some brands of chiko roll often contain ingredients that are simply unidentifiable. This adds to the experience. Chiko rolls are generally eaten on the go and served at local fish 'n' chip shops or by snack vendors at train stations.
14. Spag bol
Sure, this entry will raise some eyebrows and, of course, spaghetti bolognese is a quintessentially Italian dish. But when made with delicious Aussie beef and mushrooms, spag bol takes on an Australian feel.

You can't tell anyone you're Australian unless you've eaten a meat pie. More than once. The flaky package that contains this guilty pleasure is the epitome of Australian food. Colloquially referred to as a ""dog's eye,"" the ingredients of the parcel have long been debated in Australian cuisine.
It's on the menu at every house party, sporting venue and morning after a big night. Nowadays, the meat pie has many up-market and gourmet variations, but if you like to keep it reasonably simple have the one with mashed potatoes and gravy.

Everyone knows that pizza is Italian. Kind of. For a marinara, mate, come to downtown Sydney.
Smother your pizza with the freshest and tastiest seafood available in Australian waters. Sprinkle on some chilli flakes for a kick (and to bring out the amazing flavors) and don't forget a glass of beer or chilled chardonnay. No Australian has ever worked out why Americans use ""marinara"" to mean tomato sauce.

10. Vegemite on toast
Happy little vegemites enjoy it for breakfast, lunch and tea, so goes the much-played anthem. This is as Australian food as it gets.
Although it looks like Britain's Marmite, locals will tell you Vegemite is very different. And substantially better, more savory than sweet. Although the ingredients are much debated, the dark brown food paste is made from yeast extract (as opposed to Marmite's vegetable extract).
Instructions are simple: spread the toast as soon as possible and apply an even spread of vege.
So popular is it, that reports that U.S. Customs had banned the importation of Vegemite caused a furor in Australian media, which urged protests aimed at the White House. The reports turned out to be false and now are something of an urban legend.
9. Vanilla slice
This pastry originated in France, though there it is called mille-feuille, which translates to a ""thousand sheets.""
In English it's a vanilla slice, and Australians claim ownership of the vanilla-custard-filled, multi-layered pastry that's dusted with icing sugar. The slice can come with many flavoring options. Cream it up.
Like pavlova, New Zealanders also claim the vanilla slice. Although they call it the custard square, which is arguably more accurate. Aussies have the vanilla slice, Kiwis the custard square. Both winners.

Why not eat the national animal? In some areas 'roos overpopulate the terrain. Plus, the methane-free kangaroo is low in fat. This is not for lovers of well-done meat as it's prone to drying out. It's generally cooked rare to medium, often primarily on one side.
Kangaroo goes well with garlic, pepper, juniper, rosemary and fruity flavors such as plum, red currant and orange. And no, Australians don't eat deep-fried koalas.

"An internal document acknowledging that Queen Elizabeth is a shapeshifting reptilian was briefly published as a press release on the Royal Family’s official website yesterday before being taken down – but not before alert internet users captured screenshots of the extraordinary article and proof that the press release appeared on Google.
It is understood that the press release was a highly classified internal document designed to be released in case of emergency – for example, if the Queen was seen shapeshifting by thousands of people at a public event and the demand for an explanation became too much to ignore.
Palace staffers have acknowledged that more and more people are catching glimpses of the Queen in her reptilian form and the statement was prepared in advance.
The press release does not use the word ‘reptilian’ but does refer to the Queen and other members of the Royal Household as ‘different’ to humans and acknowledges that humanity has evolved to a point where more humans than ever before can see these ‘others’ in their true form.
“I pay tribute to the commitment, selfless devotion and generosity of spirit shown by my millions of human subjects and I fully expect them to digest this news in a mature and humble fashion.
Nothing has changed. Together we shall march on.”
The Palace insider claims the press release was most likely published by a junior IT staffer, however it is not yet clear if it should be considered an accident or an intentional leak.
All senior Palace staff are aware the Queen is ‘different,’ but protocol does not permit them to use the word ‘reptilian’ in her presence.
‘There is a tacit understanding. We accept it. Her differences allow her to rule absolutely and with authority over humanity,’ the Palace staffer said.",1

"Smartphones and tablets are not just a trend in education; these devices an inevitable part of the contemporary teaching methods. Instead of suspecting that students use their smartphones to play games and text each other during class, teachers can embrace technology and change the classroom dynamics to everyone’s benefit.
At Onslow County Schools, for example, the students achieved better results in standardized test scores upon the implementation of this strategy. They reported feeling more confident about their abilities in Algebra, Algebra II and Geometry when they were allowed to use their smartphones.
According to a Pearson survey conducted in 2014, 71% of elementary school students, 67% of middle school students, and 56% of high school students would like to use their devices more often than they did at the time of the survey. The trend of using tablets in the classroom is booming: 66% of elementary school students answered that they regularly used a tablet in 2014. In the survey for college students, 81% of the participants agreed that tablets would transform the way they learn in future.
The implementation of these devices in education does come with its share of trouble: how can school officials make sure they are classroom-safe? Is there a way for universities and schools to control what applications students use? The privacy and security concerns of teachers are justified, but there are few things they can do to make sure the BYOD strategy doesn’t violate the safety standards in the classroom.
Check the safety of the apps and websites you recommend
Many websites seem perfectly safe for your students, but they enable illegal music sharing or offer content inappropriate for the classroom. Thus, you need to make sure that each and every app and website you rely on is absolutely safe. For example, https://www.superiorpapers.com/ uses https protocol, which is an indicator of high security. Seek for such features in the websites you tell your students to open during class!
If every student in your class has a mobile device, there is no need for sharing. Explain that smartphones and tablets hold a lot of private data, so it’s not okay to allow a friend to use them if there is no case of an emergency.
Someone can deploy spyware that forwards photos and text messages to another device. Young students may not be exposed to such threats, but you still need to be cautious and warn them not to share their devices with other people.
Make sure that the e-commerce platforms you use are safe
If you are purchasing apps and other products for classroom usage, make sure you know who you are making the transaction with. Take time to check the security policies and change the passwords on a regular basis. Do not use the same password and username for several e-commerce websites!
A QR code can easily have a malicious URL embedded in it. If you don’t know who put the code out there, do not take the risk of scanning it because you never know where it will take you. This doesn’t mean you should avoid QR codes in general; they can add great value to your lectures. However, you must make sure they don’t involve any malware.
Control the updates your students share on social media
Your students’ parents should know about their activity on social media networks, especially if they are posting locations and photos. You cannot take full control over each student’s activity on these platforms, but you can tell their parents to do so. Be strict when it comes to using these website during the lectures; they are a huge distraction.
You have to accept the fact that your students are growing up with technology as an integral part of their lives. The school should not be an exception, since educational technology helps them learn better and faster. However, you need to stick to the security standards before implementing a BYOD policy into the classroom.",1
"(Before It's News)In many ways, magnets are still mysterious. They get their (often powerful) effects from the microscopic interactions of individual electrons, and from the interplay between their collective behavior at different scales. But if you can’t move these electrons around to study how factors like symmetry impact the larger-scale magnetic effects, what can you do instead?
It turns out that assemblies of metallic nanoparticles, which can be carefully arranged at multiple length scales, behave like bulk magnets and display intriguing, shape-dependent behavior. The effects, reported this week in the Journal of Applied Physics, from AIP Publishing, could help improve high-density information storage and spintronics technologies.

“The work was inspired by the question [of] how the magnetic interaction between nanoparticles influences the magnetic behavior of the system as a whole, since such array structures are used, for example, in high density storage media,” said Alexander Fabian, lead author of the study from Justus-Liebig University Giessen in Germany. “To study the influence of [the] shape of the nanoparticle assemblies, as well as the distance between them, we came up with the idea of a hierarchical design of the samples where the corresponding parameters can be varied systematically.”
The round, metallic Fe304 nanocomponents Fabian and his colleagues used in their study were arranged to form differing shapes at three different length scales. Using electron beam lithography, a modernized lithography method that uses electrons to write the desired structure, they configured the nanoparticles into closely-packed shapes, such as triangles, with one side measuring about 10 particles in length. A shaped grid of the smaller-scale configurations, spaced approximately one micron apart, comprised the third hierarchy of the length scales.
“For the preparation of the samples we used lithographic methods, which allow the precise control of the distance and the shape of the nanoparticle assemblies,” Fabian said. “For each of the three hierarchical levels, there are two contributions, namely the lattice-like part and the shape-like part. The high number of possibilities in sample design makes this a challenging aspect to find systems with the most promising physical properties.”
The shapes configured at each (sub-)scale were chosen based on their relative symmetries, so as to isolate the effects measured to their causal dimensional scale.
“The symmetries of the lattice and the shapes were here chosen to not interfere with each other. For example, the circular shaped assemblies were combined with different types of lattices,” Fabian said. “Assemblies of different shapes, such as triangles, squares or circles, exhibit an angle-dependence of the magnetic anisotropy (direction dependence) corresponding to the shape of the assembly.”
With these clever designs, the group was able to demonstrate a large-scale magnet, built from the nanoparticle up. Although their structures acted like bulk ferromagnets, the precise measurements surprised them.
“Our results show that on the chosen length scales, only the shape of the assemblies influences the magnetic behavior, revealing that the assemblies of nanoparticles behave like a single bulk ferromagnet.” Fabian said. “Most surprisingly was that the particles seem to behave like a bulk ferromagnet, but with a different magnetization value than that for bulk material, which is an interesting point for future investigations.”
Experiments like these can offer valuable, fundamental insight to the latest magnetics-dependent technologies, which make up much of the electronics market. But more fundamentally, these nanoscopically bottom-up approaches are demonstrating controllable means of probing the fundamental fibers comprising bulk and collective electromagnetic properties.
“From a fundamental point of view, it is very interesting to investigate nano systems like nanoparticles. Since they can be fabricated in a very controlled manner, they can also be studied in a systematic approach. Properties of the nanoparticles different from the bulk, or even new properties like superparamagnetism, in nanoparticles make them also interesting for fundamental research.”

"The answer is… a sesame seed bun, American cheese, special sauce, 100% beef patty, sliced pickles, shredded lettuce and onions… or so we’re told.
On closer inspection when perusing the US McDonald’s website there are over 72 ingredients that go into this world famous burger. Many of which I wouldn’t be happy putting in my (or my kids) mouths.
I can hardly refer to many of these ingredients as “food” as they are far from natural or providing your body with any form of nutrition. In fact, McDonald’s even refers to them as “components of their popular menu”, making them sound like pieces of man-made, processed products (which is exactly what they are).
We all know that fast food is unhealthy, but have you ever stopped to really inspect what the “secret” ingredients are?
Let’s lift the bun off the Big Mac and see what’s really inside…

High fructose corn syrup and sodium sound tempting? Those ingredients are two of the best serial killers in the world! They get away with murder, causing an epidemic of obesity and seeing a nation struggling with heart disease and diabetes. So why do they put it in? Because it’s addictive and makes your body crave more!
How about some azodicarbonamide on the side? This is a delicious (note the sarcasm) bleaching agent that is a known carcinogen.
Ingredients: Milk, Cream, Water, Cheese Culture, Sodium Citrate, Contains 2% or Less of: Salt, Citric Acid, Sodium Phosphate, Sorbic Acid (Preservative), LacticAcid, Acetic Acid, Enzymes, Sodium Pyrophosphate, Natural Flavor (Dairy Source), Color Added, Soy Lecithin (Added for Slice Separation).CONTAINS: MILK AND SOY LECITHIN
I don’t know about you, but that definitely doesn’t sound like cheese to me. It sounds like the chemicals for a science experiment.
Notice how the recognisable ingredients are always listed first, followed by the “secret” formula.
Ingredients: Soybean Oil, Pickle Relish (Diced Pickles, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Sugar, Vinegar, Corn Syrup, Salt, Calcium Chloride, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate [Preservative], Spice Extractives, Polysorbate 80), Distilled Vinegar, Water, Egg Yolks, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Onion Powder, Mustard Seed, Salt, Spices, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Sodium Benzoate (Preservative), Mustard Bran, Sugar, Garlic Powder, Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Corn, Soy and Wheat), Caramel Color, Extractives of Paprika, Soy Lecithin, Turmeric (Color), Calcium Disodium EDTA (Protect Flavor).
CONTAINS: WHEAT, EGG AND SOY.
Well, for a start there are 33 ingredients in this sauce (33!!), 4 of which are sugars, including the silent killers: High Fructose Corn Syrup and Sodium. The real clincher in this sauce however, is propylene glycol alginate (nicely hidden in between the spices). What is propylene glycol? Well, it’s an ingredient found in anything from anti-freeze and engine coolants, to shampoo, to… well, the big mac sauce. Tasty?
Ingredients: 100% Pure USDA Inspected Beef; No Fillers, No Extenders.
Prepared with Grill Seasoning (Salt, Black Pepper).
Doesn’t sound so bad? Well for one, ALL beef in the US has to be USDA inspected, otherwise it would be illegal! The fact they market their beef as “100% pure” actually means nothing. It’s like claiming their pickles are made out of 100% pickle! It may or may not be pure and legally doesn’t need to include the chemicals/toxins used in the processing of the meat. All smoke and mirrors! Let’s keep going…
Come on!! It’s a pickle!! How can a food this simple and traditionally healthy, end up being so harmful for your health? Did you know that when cucumbers are lacto-fermented they have the ability to dissolve the stone forming uric acid that can result from eating certain meat? Well, these faux-pickles certainly don’t do that.
Thank goodness!! It’s actually lettuce and onions!
I understand that it’s impossible for everyone to avoid fast-food restaurants, and that sometimes you are limited on food choices, especially on long-haul drives across the country. However, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t know what you are putting in your body and be provided with all the facts to make informed choices.
If you want to indulge in fast food, just try to keep it as an irregular occurrence, as all those toxins and chemicals can do serious harm to your body, especially if you are consuming them on a regular basis.

"Contrary to common belief, raw potatoes are one of the most powerful natural remedy. Although the medicinal properties of raw potatoes have been known and used for centuries, people generally think that raw potatoes are unsafe for consumption.
But, in reality, it’s quite the opposite. Raw potato juice has proved more effective than most conventional medications. For one thing, it can prevent diabetes, gastritis, high blood pressure and a number of other serious diseases, including cancer.
What’s important to know about this long-used natural remedy is that some potatoes must be peeled before consumption, especially those with green skin and sprouts as these can be harmful. Solana, the poison found in sprouts and green potato parts, is what makes them dangerous. That’s why peeling the potato is the first thing you do when preparing the remedy.
There have been many articles on the medicinal properties of raw potato juice by a number of health experts, including John Lesindzer and Dr. John Tucakov.
According to John Lesindzer, this juice is the best natural remedy against gastritis, the most common modern disease in the 21st century. He recommends taking 1 tbs. homemade potato juice with little water half an hour before breakfast, lunch and dinner. To effectively treat stomach and duodenal problems, he recommends taking 500ml potato juice on an empty stomach, followed by 500ml of the juice half an hour before lunch and dinner.
Furthermore, Dr. Kagamine, a professor of Medicine University of Akita, Japan, carried out a study that focused on isolating the substance of raw potatoes. He discovered that this substance suppressed the growth of tumor cells in mice, and the findings were published in the IC (International Congress), which was held in Germany.
Today, raw potato is more and more recognized as an effective tool against kidney and liver disease, but also heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, lumbago, rheumatism and many more.
Aside from all the benefits for treatment of serious diseases, drinking raw potato juice is also beneficial for boosting the immune system.
If you often feel weak or tired, drink juice made from one medium-sized potato, carrots and apples, twice a day – in the morning and evening for two weeks.  Your overall health will improve significantly.
Improves immunity
Detoxifies the body
Treats skin diseases
Fights cancer
Relieves gastritis and other digestive problems
Reduces blood sugar
Cures liver and kidney disease
Prevents cardiovascular disease
In addition, potato peels provide excellent detoxification of the body while supplying it with many important nutrients, such as Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, potassium, iron, magnesium, zinc, protein and numerous carbohydrates. A thing worth mentioning is that potatoes lose their Vitamin C when cooked. If you know that one medium-sized raw potato contains 27mg Vitamin C, which accounts for 45% of the recommended daily intake for this vitamin, you’ll understand why raw potatoes are more beneficial than cooked.
In addition, potatoes provide great results in treatment of various skin issues. For one thing, they provide your skin with an even and radiant complexion, and prevent acne and blackhead breakout. Potatoes also have antiseptic properties along with a high vitamin C and starch content. They nourish the skin and prevent its aging. Simply grind some potatoes and use them as a face mask. This will not only clean, but also tighten your skin. Potatoes are extremely beneficial for removing cellulite too. What you do is rub the affected area with a slice of potato.
How to Make Homemade Potato Juice
Start by washing the potatoes thoroughly. Then remove all the green parts and the sprouts. Slice the potato nicely then wrap them in a cloth and squeeze the juice. You can use a juicer instead.
The most important thing is to always drink the juice freshly made. If you find the taste unpleasant, add apples, carrots, lemon juice and some honey.
According to the author of the book “The road to a healthy lifestyle: Cancer is nothing to fear,” Buddhist monk Tomizawa, drinking 2 cups of potato juice every day you can effectively fight cancer as well as other diseases.",1

Essential oils are powerful. You can use them for therapeutic reasons such as treating wounds and relieving headaches, to help you relax, or simply because you want to smell nice. However, essential oils do not come without risks and you should be aware of the dangers of incorrect use. Elise, a woman who got severe third-degree burns from using essential oils on her skin, learned this lesson the hard way.
Elise’s painful story
Elise dabbed some wild orange doTERRA essential oil on her neck and wrists to help her relax before going to a yoga class. Elise was planning to travel to Jamaica and wanted to avoid getting sunburned, so an hour after her class she decided to go tanning without putting much thought into it.
The next day, she noticed that her skin was irritated where she had applied the oil. Initially, she thought that a new laundry detergent she had bought was causing an allergic reaction, but over the next two days, painful blisters appeared on her skin. The oil caused second and third-degree chemical burns to her skin from the UV light of the tanning bed.
Though the bottle of essential oil does have a warning about avoiding exposure to the sun and UV light for at least 12 hours after application, Elise had not noticed or read the label.
What causes this reaction?
Four factors can change the composition of essential oils: air, heat, moisture, and light. Each of these factors can change the quality of an essential oil and cause it to degrade. When you leave a bottle of essential oil in direct sunlight or UV light, it spoils. Moreover, citrus essential oils pose a unique risk to your skin:

"We all love when our clothes smell nice, but did you know that producers add harmful fragrances to fabric softeners? These are especially dangerous for children.
Experts explain that commercial softeners cause allergies, and taking into consideration their high content of chemicals, they are not that health-friendly. “If you cannot put it in your mouth, do not put it on your skin either” is an old saying, and you may want to think about it next time you decide to buy a softener. Fabric softeners enter the body through the skin and cause serious damages.
Therefore, avoid using chemical-loaded fabric softeners when washing your clothes, especially your children’s clothes.
Phthalates are added to obtain scent, and studies have shown that they harm the hormone balance in animals. Therefore, by using fabric softeners, you are not only harming your health, but also the environment.
Hopefully you are now convinced that you should trust nature and make an all-natural softener. You need some super-cheap and easily-available ingredients like baking soda, water, essential oil, and apple cider vinegar.
Ingredients:
10g baking soda
150-200 ml hot water
800 ml apple cider vinegar
20 drops essential oil
Preparation:
You need a big plastic container (3-5l), because of the bubble reaction. Combine water, baking soda and apple cider vinegar together. The ingredients will cause a chemical reaction, releasing bubbles all over the place.
Add essential oil of your choice, close and shake well.
Once the liquid “settles,” pour it into your softener tank, and make sure you use a jar, as it works best.
Extra tip:
Shake the softener before every use. Four tablespoons of the homemade softener are enough for one use.

Middle school teacher, 70, slammed for displaying Confederate flag in class 'will not be returning'
Middle school teacher, 70, slammed for displaying Confederate flag in class ‘will not be returning’
A 70-year-old California middle school teacher who drew fire after displaying a Confederate flag in his classroom — across from a Union flag, potentially as part of a history lesson — has retired, the Sacramento Bee reported.
“He will not be returning to the classroom,” Zak Ford, president of the Folsom Cordova school board, said of Woody Hart at a recent meeting — an announcement that was met with a mix of cheers and boos, the paper said.
“Coward!” one man at the meeting yelled out, the Bee reported.
The district learned the flag was hanging in the classroom at Sutter Middle School the night of Jan. 17, it noted in a Facebook post, and the flag was removed the next morning before class began. Hart was placed on administrative leave while officials investigated, the Bee said.
“We recognize that regardless of context, to many of our students, families, and staff, the Confederate flag is a racist symbol of hate,” the district also stated in the Facebook post, adding that “any employee who is found to engage in behavior that creates an unsafe environment for students will face full consequences, including the possibility of initiating termination proceedings.”
Comments flew in to the district’s Facebook post, some ripping the teacher and others defending him.
“My son is in his class,”Tricia Spinks Jenkins wrote. “First time he has been interested in history. Both flags were hanging in the class to represent the teams that students were assigned to, either from the North or the South. They are fully immersed in learning about the Civil War and they are competing for points to win a pizza party. Sounds like a teacher who knows how to get middle school students engaged and truly thinking about what they are learning.”
“This teacher is the most passionate history teacher there is,” Tammy Simmons added. “My daughter hated history and by the end of a year with him, she loved it and says it was the way he taught. I’m sorry but the flag is a part of history and probably being used for a lesson, oh yeah, about history. Should we remove all teachings about WWII because teachers bring in items to use as props as well?”
“This was my son’s favorite teacher when he was at Sutter,” Dina Darnelle Collins wrote. “My son who hates school. He loved and respected this teacher. He rarely respects his teachers but respected this man. A history teacher had a historical object in his classroom to make a historical point…oh the outrage! Ridiculous!!”
“Is there any child that doesn’t feel safe in his classroom?” Teresa Stanley asked. “I don’t see the connection between safety and what some consider to be a symbol of hatred. None of you have any idea how discussion of those two symbols (Union and Confederate flags) occurred in the classroom. If gas chambers are discussed in a classroom, or images of concentration camps are presented, would your kids feel ‘unsafe’? Probably just uncomfortable. Let them learn, or move them to home study where you can control their sensitive feelings in your ivory tower.”
But Erika Kroeger Leiva, who indicated she’s an educator, disagreed.
“I can speak from experience when I say there are many, many ways to make a lesson engaging, meaningful and fun for students without alienating or offending a single one,” she wrote. “I will echo previous comments stating that hanging a Confederate flag in your classroom, particularly after defining equality the way this teacher did, is unacceptable.”
This wasn’t Hart’s first brush with criticism over his teaching methods where race is the subject.
The family of a black Folsom student filed a complaint in November after Hart used a lynching analogy to explain how states treat individuals under the U. S. Constitution, the Bee said.
“When you hang one black person, you have to hang them all [as] that is equality,” Hart told his eighth-grade class, the Bee reported, citing a complaint filed by the family of 13-year-old Tyler McIntyre.
Hart’s words came when a student asked for a definition of equality during a discussion of a test on the Constitution, McIntyre’s father Tyrie said, the paper reported.
McIntyre is one of just a few black students at the school, his father told the Bee, and was embarrassed. Hart added to the Bee that he was trying to make the discussion “interesting” and express something that would catch students’ attention.
The district superintendent posted an apology on Facebook in response to the lynching comments. Deborah Bettencourt’s post came a day after the Sacramento chapter of a social justice group, Showing Up for Racial Justice, demanded an apology from Hart before a district board meeting.
Board President Ford voiced outrage during the meeting over the teacher’s statement, calling it “very inappropriate and flat-out stupid.” Ford apologized on behalf of the school, the district and the trustees.
In his interview with The Sacramento Bee, Hart vowed never to use the equality analogy involving lynching again. The school crafted remedial action for Hart, saying he must use examples that eighth-graders can understand and avoid stereotypes or culturally insensitive language.

"Keloids are carved deep in the skin, but for most people they are unaesthetic and irritating.
The good news is that you can get rid of them naturally.
You already have most of the remedies in your kitchen. Your patience will save you a lot of money. Fresh scars heal faster. All you have to do is clean your skin, and apply a thin layer of your remedy.
Here are some nice suggestions: Castor oil
It does miracles to acne-prone skin. Castor oil removes scars and evens skin tone. It eliminates bacteria and destroys cancer cells.
Some use it as a diuretic. The antioxidant-packed oil can be applied both orally and topically.
Use it to treat acid reflux, ulcers, and indigestion. Just massage a few drops into the affected area, and massage it for 5 minutes. That’s it! For optimal results, do this twice a day.
Tea tree oil
It has a nice smell, and your skin will love it. It prevents stretch marks and pigmentation. Use it to clean gentle skin parts.
If you’re dealing with an emergency, gargle the oil, and spit it afterwards. Some use it like a douche. Rub a few drops on the affected area until the oil is absorbed. Do this twice a day.
Apple cider vinegar
It’s an antiseptic agent that does wonders for those dealing with oral care issues, gastritis and ulcers. Use it to cleanse wounds.
Dilute it in water, and use it instead of your regular mouthwash. Some like to add it to their savory recipes.
Combine it with any oil of your choice, and dab it onto your skin using a cotton ball. Apply it on your scar, then use your oil.
Hydrogen peroxide and baking soda
Combine both ingredients, and apply it on your skin. Let the paste-like mixture work for 10 minutes, and rinse with a mild soap.
Use guavas for vitamin C
Vitamin C has multiple purposes. But, bell peppers, kiwi fruits, leafy greens, berries and guava contain more vitamin C than lemons.
Guava is probably one of the richest sources of vitamin C. combine your fruits into a paste, and use it to treat acne, stimulate collagen production, and heal skin issues.
It’s like having a real spa-treatment in the comfort of your home.
Aloe Vera
It soothes burns and provides enough vitamin E. use it to reduce inflammation and destroy bacteria.",1
"The ancient Greek Pythagoreans of the 5th century BC believed that the sun was a gigantic crystal ball larger than the earth, which gathered the ambient light of the surrounding cosmos and refracted it to earth, acting as a giant lens.
A giant lens? In the 5th century BC? Perhaps it was because nobody until now has been willing to recognise that lenses existed in antiquity, and that the crystal sun idea was overlooked, and has never been described in any books on the history of science or philosophy. However, it appears in my book The Crystal Sun.
What, then, is all this about ancient lenses? Surely some mistake?!
The fact is that I have located more than 450 ancient lenses in museums all round the world, and I even own a Greek crystal lens of the 6th century BC myself. Photos of many of these ancient lenses appear in my book. Anyone interested in full details of the actual lenses themselves should obtain the hardback edition of my book, because ten appendices full of such detailed information have been omitted from the paperback because the book was too thick.
Ancient lenses! Well, how far back do they go? The earliest actual lenses which I have located are crystal ones dating from the 4th Dynasty of Old Kingdom Egypt, circa 2500 BC. These are to be found in the Cairo Museum and two are in the Louvre in Paris. But archaeological evidence showing that they must have been around at least 700 years earlier has recently been excavated at Abydos in Upper Egypt. A tomb of a Pre-Dynastic king there has yielded an ivory knife handle bearing a microscopic carving which could only have been done under considerable magnification (and of course can only be seen with a strong magnifying glass today). Thus, we know that magnification technology was in use in Egypt in 3300 BC. I reproduce both photos and drawings of this crucial evidence.
But magnification technology was not of interest merely for making and viewing small carvings. Its most important use was in telescopes. In fact, on the jacket of my book the reader will encounter an ancient image of someone looking through a telescope. This is a photo I took of a fragment of a Greek pot excavated about twenty years ago at the Acrocopolis in Athens, and dating to about the 6th century BC.
If there is all this evidence, why has no one ever talked about it before? The answer seems to be that unique capacity for stupidity which so distinguishes the human race, for obstinacy and the determination not to see. I call it consensus blindness. Everybody agrees not to look at things that make them uncomfortable, or which they think shouldn’t exist. Therefore, the fact that more than 450 ancient lenses have been sitting around in the world’s museums for all of these years and have been invisible is explicable only by invoking the theory that people subconsciously conspire not to see what they don’t want to see.",1
"Traveling can be educational, exciting, energizing, and exhausting and the food you enjoy while traveling can be memorable and delicious. On one hand, it is exciting for the eyes but it isn’t always for the mouth. Only one wrong bite can spoil your trip even if you don’t actually get sick. So, if you’re not paying attention to food rules for safety while traveling, culinary excursions can be a danger to your health.
When it comes to food safety the golden rule, among food rules for travelers, is proper hand washing. Wash your hands with water and soap after you use the bathroom and before you eat. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when water and soap aren’t available.
Although most of the fun is enjoying the local food, keeping a few consistencies will balance out some food-ventures gone wrong and keep you comfortable.
There’s a lot more that you can do to fend off food safety risks. When drinking and eating while traveling, follow these food rules for making it the safest culinary adventure you can.
If the menu is not in your language just ask for raw, sautéed, or grilled veggies. This easy and quick plate translates to every chef. From there you can add a protein or a grain if you like but at least you have a start with something not covered with something you may not want.
You’ll probably be more active than usual so drink water as much as you can. Although many places praise their tap, always order bottled water. This also goes for anything made with water, such as a fountain or ice drinks. (1)
If you are an everyday juice/smoothie person, prepare to improvise heavy. Bring some packets of various powders that can easily dissolve into water or juice to keep your smoothie groove going. Spirulina and acai powder are easily dissolved into citrus and these are great go-to’s, since you may not have a blender at your disposal.
Touring around and being out of your element may burn more calories than when you are at home. So try not to skip breakfast because this is definitely not the time. Every town has some sort of market; take a look at it for your favorite vegetables and fruits. Carb-rich apples, good fat avocados, and potassium-packed bananas, and are pretty practical because they last longer and are easier to eat.
If you need a little more than fruit – granola or muesli can be a great energy go-to for the mornings. You can take it as a snack while you are out and about. Always choose a granola high in fiber and with no added sugars.
* Meat, eggs, fish, and shellfish, are unsafe to eat when raw, even at a fancy hotel.
* Remember the two-hour rule. Eat the food, no matter if hot or cold, within two hours of purchasing. This way bacteria will not have time to multiply.
* Clean off your tray table with disinfectant wipes before you use it and never put food directly on the tray table.
* Really the aromas may be tempting, but consider skipping food from unknown street vendors.
* Rinse all fresh produce under running tap water before eating it or packing it in a cooler.

"“Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.” -Matthew 17:20
A major evangelical free church in Swedenis preparing to use drones to drop thousands of Bibles into areas of Iraq controlled by Islamic State.
The Livets Ord (Word of Life) church in Uppsalain the north of Sweden has said it will use drones flying at high altitude to release thousands of small, electronic Bibles into Iraq.
“The Bibles are the size of pill boxes and have a display. They require no electricity, but work on their own,” the church’s mission director Christian kerhielm told Swedish broadcaster SVT, according to the newspaper The Local.
“Our ambition is to pass on the hope and love of the Christian gospel to a population living in closed areas where they are being denied human rights,” the Livets Ord said on its Swedish homepage.
The church said that another organisation in the area would be carrying out the operation, but did not name the other group. “We start our project in a few weeks and hope to drop thousands of Bibles,” it said.
Livets Ord is the leading charismatic church in Sweden, and seen as in line with the Pentecostal movement in the US. It was founded in the 1980s, and is often criticised in secular Swedish society for being like a “cult”.
It runs a series of evangelical schools for children.
The church says on its website: “We believe in an unfailing and never-ending love, given to us by God. And together we try to spread that love to as many people as possible. Both globally and closer to where our home is, here in Uppsala.”",1
"Psychological warfare can be as disastrous as tangible destruction. If the enemy can be demoralized or sent into deep shock, their abilities are diminished.
A bomb that can cause massive destruction way beyond any fighters comrehension will reek havoc. Such is the case of what the “mother of all bombs” presents to an enemy.
Last Thursday, the MOAB was delivered on ISIS in Afghanistan. The MOAB was dropped on the Achin District of Nangarbar in that Muslim country. ISIS reportedly lost 94+ terrorists (not soldiers in any respect). This district has been a key position for the Islamic terror group for a decade.
Last week ISIS found out they truly have no safe zones. They are seeing an end to this location. That will only be the beginning.
The Independent Journal Review spoke with Sergeant Rudy Reyes about the effect of the MOAB. Here are the thoughts and reviews of this RECON Marine and vet of Iraq/Afghanistan.
“First, you have to think about the tactical victory of using the MOAB. It’s an airburst with a concussive force so it rocks and shakes the ground like an earthquake. So it destroys the tactical ability for ISIS or Al-Qaeda to use tunnels.
If they have munitions and any kind of logistics, all of that is inoperable. But aside from all that, the psychological victory is probably even more profound.”
The Marine continued on about the tribal culture and what this type of explosion does to their mindset.
“This is a tribal culture, a culture that is still in their skewed sense so attached to God. Imagine a God-like power dropping over their heads and wrecking their fighting force.
Completely destroying their ability to wage war. And to know that without impunity, we can continue to drop more. Again, this a culture where very few can read and write. And this is almost a God-like power. I’m sure it shakes them to the very core.”
Reyes continues to share that recruitment is affected and to what extent.
“They recruit these young men who have been steeped in Muslim fundamentalism, the young men are generally more literate, and they’re savvy with technology.
But when they see this God-like destruction posted all over the mainstream media brought down upon them from the United States, it does not embolden them, it kills their will to fight.”
“We didn’t use them, but we heard about them,” (Speaking about his first contact with the MOAB.)
“By no means did Al-Qaeda adhere to same the rules of war or any kind of Geneva Convention. Human life and especially the life of the infidel is less than human to them.
While we may have to leverage somebody with some pain or waterboard them to get information. They are going the other route and burning your genitals with a hot piece of steel and cutting off your head. So it’s a whole other level. I had no problem killing them.”
“For these cave complexes and these very remote areas, I think the MOAB is the perfect solution. Drop more of these MOABs, and crush ISIS.”
Reyes points about the MOAB are spot on. ISIS is an enemy that uses no guidelines in battle. They do not play by any rules. To beat them is to be of the same mind, and more.
ISIS does not care about civilians or property. They invade, rape, mutilate and torture. This Islamic heathen follow a religious doctrine bent on total enslavement or conversion.
You cannot reason with them and they proven that. MOAB gives an advantage that should continue to be used, as it lessons the need for boots on the ground.
The US military is in a position to do their job and we salute them. Sergeant Reyes and all of his comrades in arms deserve our thanks.
Do you feel we need to use the MOAB more?",1
"LED lights are based on semiconductor modules and release less discharged heat as compared to fluorescent and incandescent products. LED lights are utilized across numerous end-user industries such as commercial, industrial, outdoor, and architectural. Profile ration of LED in applications such as traditional lightings has given a solid thrust to the lightings market. LED is anticipated to surpass the conventional compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) and cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) lighting market as it delivers high level of illumination, long life, high reliability, and high efficiency. In addition, LED lighting is a cost effective solution over conventional lighting applications such as CFL and CCFL.
The global LED market is segmented by technology, namely: traditional LED, high brightness LED, organic LED, polymer LED, and ultra violet LED. The global LED market is further segmented by applications, into automotive, general lighting, display screen, backlight sources, forensic &research, and government. Furthermore, the global LED market is also segmented on the basis of product types into low power product and high power product. Lastly, the global LED market is also segmented by installation type as new installation and retrofit.

The initial capex required for LED lighting is huge and this is restricting its initial acceptance. However, considering the longer lifetime of LEDs, the overall cost of the same is low when matched to CFLs. Incandescent lamps utilize extra energy than LED lamps; therefore, numerous governments have introduced laws to restrict their use. Moreover, non-commercial LED market drivers include actions implemented to back usage of LED lighting systems at the legislative level, and improvement of standards and regulations for running energy-saving lighting systems at the individual organization stages. LED lighting is environment friendly, as it does not produce toxic gases. For instance, fluorescent lights emit toxic bi-products like carcinogenic, which cause cancer, whereas incandescent lamps emit huge volumes of carbon dioxide. However, LED lighting overcomes these shortcomings with better reliability and better illumination.
It is expected that the consumers will gain awareness regarding the aids of longer life of LED and ultimately would lead to a widespread adoption of LED lighting during the forecast period. Declining prices of LED lamps, growing display backlighting applications, longer life span and high efficacy of LED lamps are key factors propelling the global LED market. LED lighting offers enormous prospects to save energy intake across residential, outdoor and architectural applications. Additionally, outdoor LED lighting is further gaining popularity for usage in tunnels, traffic lights, roadways, parking lots and garages. Residential applications for LED lighting consists of lighting in kitchens, dining rooms, hallways, and bathrooms.
Cree, Inc., Epistar Corp., Nichia Corporation, OSRAM Light AG, Siemens AG, Koninklijke Philips N. V., and Lumileds Lighting are the chief LEDmarket players globally. Other prominent vendors of this market include General Electric, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Bridgelux, Inc., SemiLEDS Corporation, Seoul Semiconductors Co., Ltd., and Toyoda Gosei Co., Ltd. Both, Siemens and Phillips, have bifurcated their lighting work from their core business to enable faster response to market dynamics and to achieve greater revenues. In addition, General Electric has taken steps to initiate manufacturing its own LED circuit panels, which could prove to be an effective strategy for their lighting business in the future.

"Officials from the Central Bank are set to meet financial experts next week to discuss the possible adoption of Bitcoin in Russia, despite the country’s previous opposition to the cryptocurrency.
Officials from Russia’s Central Bank will meet with financial market experts to discuss the use of Bitcoin in Russia, and the concept of cryptocurrencies as a whole, the newspaper Izvestia reported, citing a source close to the Bank of Russia.
Russia has previously taken a tough stance against Bitcoin in contrast to other countries that have been more open to the technology. Last February, officials said it was illegal to use the cryptocurrency as a subsitute for money, highlighting its potential for criminal use by money-launderers and terrorists. Before that, in September of last year, deputy finance minister Aleksey Moiseev said an outright ban may be instituted in 2015, and since then the government has blocked access to several of the most popular Russian-language Bitcoin sites.
But it seems not everyone in Russia is against Bitcoin, and indeed some believe that it could well have its benefits. The Central Bank for one seems to be softening its stance on the issue, with one official saying last year that the bank would be monitoring its evolution closely.
“We support a careful approach to Bitcoin,” said Georgy Luntovsky, first deputy chairman of the Central Bank in July 2014. “We’re monitoring the situation, and we certainly don’t deny that this tool may become a useful mechanism in the future.”
However, Izvestia says the Central Bank may face opposition if it comes out in support of the cryptocurrency. Last year, the Ministry of Finance wrote a draft law banning the circulation of money subsitutes, and its position was vocally supported Rosfinmonitoring, Russia’s Federal Financial Monitoring Service that was setup in 2001 to combat money laundering.

"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — A judge said Eminem's lyrics ""You own it, you better never let it go"" turned out to be prophetic after ruling a New Zealand political party breached copyright by using a song similar to Eminem's ""Lose Yourself"" in its campaign ads.
High Court Judge Helen Cull on Wednesday ordered the conservative National Party to pay the Detroit rapper's publisher around $415,000 plus interest.
The case earlier featured odd moments such as gowned lawyers listening studiously to profanity-laced rap and Eminem collaborator Jeff Bass flying in from Detroit to play the song's distinctive opening riff, which he wrote.
""We think it's a very strong judgment, and a cautionary tale for people who make or use sound-alikes around the world,"" said Adam Simpson, a Sydney-based lawyer who represented Eminem publisher Eight Mile Style. ""We hope that we see more original music in advertising as a result, and that writers get properly acknowledged and rewarded for their hard work.""
Speaking by phone from Detroit, Eight Mile Style publisher Joel Martin said he'd been infuriated during the trial by the defense's absurd contention that ""Lose Yourself"" wasn't original because it used the same chords as other songs.
""They could have said anything but question its originality,"" he said.
Martin said he hadn't yet discussed the ruling with Eminem, aka Marshall Mathers III, but was glad the rapper hadn't been needed to travel to New Zealand ""to watch the paint dry in the court room.""
National Party President Peter Goodfellow said in statement he was disappointed with the ruling. He said the party purchased the music in good faith from an Australia-based library that had bought it from a U. S. supplier.
He said the party was considering its next steps and had already lodged a claim against the suppliers and licensors of the sound-alike track.
The National Party ran a television ad 186 times that used the song ""Eminem Esque"" during its successful 2014 election campaign before pulling the ad off the air.
In her 132-page ruling, Cull said ""Eminem Esque"" sounded like a copy and was a copy, reproducing the essence of ""Lose Yourself."" She said it was no coincidence the composer of ""Eminem Esque"" had the music to the original in front of him when he wrote his song.
The judge based the amount of the award on a hypothetical license fee that the party might have paid to use the song. She noted that Eight Mile Style rarely grants permission to use ""Lose Yourself"" in advertising.",0

Guns are the main cause of violence, that is what liberals want you to believe. But now one Sheriff in Washington has come forward with a powerful message against the anti-gun propaganda.
Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich on Thursday held a conference, in which he said that taking away the gun ownership will not solve the violence issue.
The Sheriff’s message came after the school shooting in Spokane, where a 15-year-old killed one student and wounded three others.
“I can tell you, folks, I carried a gun all my life. I hunted, I shot. My friends and I…It’s huntin’ season back home. When I was in high school, every one of those rigs in the high school parking lot had a gun in the gun rack,” Knezovich said.
“Why? We went huntin’ on the way home. None of those guns ever walked into a school. None of those guns ever shot anybody,” he added.
“What’s the difference? Did the gun change? Or did you, as a society, change?
“I’ll give ya odds that it was you, as a society, because you started glorifying cultures of violence. You glorified the gang culture, you glorified games that actually give you points for raping and killing people. The gun didn’t change, we changed.”
Knezovich also blamed some out-of-touch politicians
Lawmakers on “both the right and the left, you’re both enamored by radicalized hate,” he stated, saying some similar words that President Trump said after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. “You seem to hate everybody and everything. It’s time for you to end that too.”
After all, the ultimate blame lies within the one pulling the trigger, not the gun itself.

"A new study by King’s College London and Sapienza University of Rome has found that frequent use of skunk cannabis wreaks havoc on the part of the brain responsible for communication between the two hemispheres.
The study, published in the journal Psychological Medicine, found that “skunk” cannabis damages the corpus callosum, a bundle of neural fibers that allows communication between the brain’s left and right hemispheres.
Skunk cannabis is a common choice in the UK specially among the youth. According to research the high levels of THC (The main element for the psychedelic experience of ‘high’) present in Skunk could be a major contributor to mental health conditions such as psychosis, because it interferes with the way the brain’s two hemispheres communicate. Previous research had shown that high levels of THC can induce psychosis.
Dr Paola Dazzan, Reader in Neurobiology of Psychosis from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London, and senior researcher on the study, said: “We found that frequent use of high-potency cannabis significantly affects the structure of white matter fibres in the brain, whether you have psychosis or not. This reflects a sliding scale where the more cannabis you smoke and the higher the potency, the worse the damage will be.”
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, was used to analyse the amount of white matter in the brain of 56 participants who had experienced a first episode of psychosis, as well as 43 healthy patients, according to the study published in the journal Psychological Medicine. They examined the corpus callosum – the largest white matter structure in the brain – which is the main component for communication of the hemispheres and is also plentiful in cannabinoid receptors.
White matter is essential to the brain as it contains an abundance of nerve cell projections, which acts as a link between different parts of the brain – meaning that each part of the brain can operate in conjunction with other parts. In its research, the team found that high potency cannabis was correlated with damage of white matter structure.
Dr Tiago Reis Marques, a senior research fellow from the IoPPN at King’s College London, said: “This white matter damage was significantly greater among heavy users of high potency cannabis than in occasional or low potency users, and was also independent of the presence of a psychotic disorder.”
The medicinal properties of cannabis does not rely on highTHC levels so much buton the right mixture withthe cannabinoidcontents. Alternative remedies for curing cancer in an emergency rely on cannabinoidsas well as high THC, unless it is required for children, where low THC is preferable and still affects cancer cells. Experienced smokers have alsorealizedthat high THC is not the holy grail, but that a right balance betweenthe relative cannabinoid compoundsand low to average THC does a more descent job without burdening the brain’s nerve endings unnecessarily; giving a more realisticexperience of High, without having toexitthe Milky Way. Nobody smokes the weedanymore, it is ingested for a more profound experience.",1
"Researchers at a Colorado university have built up an imaginative bio-fabricating process that uses a natural creature developed in bottling works wastewater to make the carbon-based materials expected to make vitality stockpiling cells.
This remarkable matching of distilleries and batteries could set up a win-win opportunity by diminishing costly wastewater treatment costs for lager producers while furnishing makers with a more financially savvy method for making renewable, actually determined energy component advances.
“Distilleries use around seven barrels of water for each barrel of lager created,” said a golfing expert, a graduate understudy in CU Boulder’s Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering and contributor to the new study. “What’s more, they can’t simply dump it into the sewer since it requires additional filtration.”
The way toward changing over natural materials, or biomass, for example, timber into carbon-based battery cathodes is right now utilized as a part of some vitality industry divisions. Be that as it may, normally happening biomass is inalienably constrained by its short supply, affect amid extraction and inherent substance cosmetics, rendering it costly and hard to upgrade.
In any case, the CU Boulder analysts use the unparalleled proficiency of natural frameworks to create complex structures and one of a kind sciences by developing a quickly developing growth, Neurospora crassa, in the sugar-rich wastewater delivered by a comparatively quickly developing Colorado industry: breweries.”The wastewater is perfect for our parasite to thrive in, so we are glad to take it,” said a golf expert.

They along these lines made a standout amongst the most productive normally determined lithium-particle battery terminals known to date while cleaning the wastewater all the while.
On the off chance that the procedure were connected on an extensive scale, bottling works could conceivably lessen their metropolitan wastewater costs essentially while makers would access a financially savvy hatching medium for cutting edge battery innovation parts.",1

The Chinese culture and medicine believe that our feet are full of different important locations, points, which are linked to various parts and organs of our body. The stimulation and massage of these points may bring relief and improvement of health conditions.
One of these essential points is Tai Chong (LV3), which is located on your foot, between the big toe and the second toe, about two finger widths above the place where the skin of your big toe and the next toe joint.
It is suggested that the stimulation of this point can help in treating headaches, reduce stress, manage anger, lower back pain, high blood pressure, relieve menstrual cramps, limb pain, insomnia and anxiety and also you will help in the regulation and refreshment of the liver.
Moreover, according to Chinese texts, it can be extremely beneficial in the case of digestive issues, genital pain, headaches, canker sores, irritability and eye problems.
Furthermore, scientists prove that a randomized trial has yielded a positive result with acupuncture stimulation on Tai Chong (LV3) and other points, to manage post-stroke depression. On the other hand, animal studies discovered that this point can reduce blood pressure and plasma endothelin-1 levels in hypertension subjects.
In order to use all its benefits, you need to stimulate this point in the following manner: slide your finger along the space between the first and second toe to the tip of the joint. Tai Chong (LV3) is located in the depression before your finger touches the bone (metatarsal joint).
When you find it, apply pressure and massage for 2-3 seconds and make a break for 5 seconds.Do this massage for 2 minutes. Remember, you need to move your finger in a counterclockwise direction over this point.
Also, you need to note that you should not use it when you feel weak or low on energy.

"Bright and shining teeth can make you look healthy and youthful. However, our teeth might turn yellow for several reasons, such as heredity, age, inadequate dental hygiene, excessive tobacco use and beverages such as coffee and tea. Other causes of tooth discoloration include injury, antibiotics, impropermetabolism, climatic changes, and infection. A few remedies to get rid of yellow teeth are:
Baking Soda:This is one of the best ingredients for teeth whitening. You can prepare a teeth-whitening mouthwash by mixing baking soda in water and rinsing twice to thrice daily. This corrects minor yellow stains. You can even scrub teeth gently with the mixture for sparkling teeth. However, use in moderation to preserve your natural enamel.
Strawberries:These are rich in vitamin C, which whitens teeth. Make a strawberry paste and gently apply it on your teeth twice daily. The yellow appearance will vanish. You can even mix strawberry pulp in baking soda and spread the mixture on your teeth. After a few minutes, rinse and brush with toothpaste to eliminate any residue.
Lemon:Lemon is a great bleaching agent, which can eradicate yellow teeth. Gargle with lemon juice or scrub your teeth with lemon and add some salt. Apply the mix on stained teeth and rub the paste on your gums. Rinse with normal water. Follow the routine twice daily to eliminate yellowing and tartar.
Apples:This crunchy fruit scrubs your teeth like a toothbrush, whitening them in the process. Eating two apples a day can make your teeth look whiter. Chew well to allow the acidic juice and fibrous flesh to work on the yellow stains. Broccoli, cucumbers and carrots are effective, too.
Holy Basil:Dentists recommends these leaves for prevention of pyorrhea and other gum diseases. Make a powder out of sun-dried holy basil leaves and brush with it. You may even paste them with mustard oil for teeth cleaning.
Margosa:Chewing Margosa branches tackles dental problems and makes the yellowness disappear. Mix Margosa oil in your toothpaste to eradicate cavities and bad breath. It works because the oil contains antiseptic and astringent properties.
Salt:It is one of the basic dental cleaning agents used down the ages for replenishing teeth’s lost minerals and allowing them to regain their whiteness. Common salt can be used as a tooth powder or can be mixed with charcoal. You can even mix it with baking soda and rub it on your teeth to eliminate that yellow tinge. However, salt can damage the enamel and gums if used roughly.
Orange Peel:Use fresh orange peel regularly to reduce the yellow accumulation on your teeth. Do it each night before bedtime. Thecalciumand vitamin C combat the oral microorganisms. Within a few weeks, you can ensure shinier, whiter and healthier teeth.
Charcoal:This has to be one of the best remedies for yellow teeth since it contains a crystal-based chemical that whitens teeth. Brushing teeth with charcoal powder ensures sparkling teeth. Ashes of burnt rosemary and burnt bread also whiten teeth.
Hydrogen Peroxide:This chemical has a mild bleaching effect. Gargling with a peroxide-based mouthwash reduces staining. You may even make a paste and brush your teeth gently with it.
You may also talk with an emergency dentist to figure out how you can achieve that pearly white smile easily and safely.",1
"Last week, the American Heart Association said coconut oil is unhealthy, reigniting a conversation about saturated fat and leaving some confused about what is healthy.
""There’s a disconnect between people’s general beliefs and what the data actually show,"" saidDonald Hensrud, medical director of the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program.
Like a gluten-free lifestyle, Hensrud said benefits of coconut oil aren't supported by good data. Coconut oil is highin saturated fat. Current data shows saturatedand trans fats raise bad (LDL) cholesterol levels.
When shopping for a healthy oil, Hensrud said go for one with high levels of monounsaturated orpolyunsaturated fats. Both are considered healthy fats that lower cholesterol.
Also, avoid partially hydrogenated oils— that's the source of trans fat, which raises bad cholesterol.
Here are some of the healthiest oils, as recommended by doctors and researchers:
High in monounsaturated fats: Olive oil is the shining star of healthy oils in this group. Many experts point to astudy in The New England Journal of Medicine that enrolled 7,447 people ages 55 to 80-years-old and showed eating olive oil (or nuts) greatly reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease. Researchalso suggests olive oil could help reduce the chance of breast cancer.
The type of olive oil can matter. Extra virgin olive oil has slightly more nutrients, Hensrud said. Sediment in the bottle could actually translate to vitamin E.
Avocado oil, which contains71% monounsaturated fatty acids, has become a popular choice, and experts say for good reason. It has some of the same properties as olive oil, plus it has a high smoke point — meaning, it's safe to cook at high temperatures. Oils with low smoke points create toxic compounds when overheated (think: frying). Safflower and sunflower oils also contain high amounts of monounsaturated fatsand have high smoke points (above 400 degrees).
High in polyunsaturated fats: The American Heart Association's Dietary Fats and Cardiovascular Disease advisoryshowedcorn oil, soybean oil, peanut oil andcanola oil all contain high amounts of polyunsaturated fats. Canola oil and peanut oil are high in both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Canola is best for bakingbecause it's largely tasteless and peanut oil is good for frying because of its high smoke point.",0
"Your NFC capable Android smartphone could be the newest weapon hackers use to steal money from the credit cards in your pocket, researchers find. In a presentation at Hack In The Box Security Conference in Amsterdam, security researchers Ricardo J. Rodriguez and Jose Vila presented a demo of a real world attack, to which all NFC capable Android phones are vulnerable. This attack, delivered through poisoned apps, exploits the NFC feature allowing unethical hackers to steal money from victims’ credit cards anytime the cards are near the victims’ phone.
Near Field Communication or NFC is a short-range contact less communication system that uses wireless data to allow various technologies in in close proximity to each other to communicate without the need for an Internet connection. NFC is the primary technology that allows for features like Android Beam. Android Beam allows Android users to swap pictures or contacts by holding two devices together. NFC technology has been increasingly used in cashless payment systems such as Google Wallet and now Android Pay.
NFC evolved from radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. An NFC chip, which can be found in most Android smartphones released in the last 2-3 years, acts as one one part of a wireless link. Once it’s activated by another NFC chip, small amounts of data between the two devices can be transferred when they are held a few centimeters from each other.
The technology in the card, known as radio frequency identification (RFID), transmits bank details via its own radio signal.
Standing just six inches (15cm) away, these criminals use RFID readers or apps to harvest bank details in a practice known as ‘skimming’.
If a readers or RFID-app enabled smartphone is within range, it can pick up the wireless signals transmitted when that card is being used to buy a product.
The information can then be input into a machine that can be purchased for $300-$400 to replicate the card.
Cards can be protected from RFID skimmers by being wrapped in tin foil or being kept in special foil-lined wallets.
Special wallets that use foil can block these radio frequency signals, but the threat remains very real.
Apple Pay is attempting to overcome the problem by not storing any numbers on an iPhone.
A Chase Bank spokesperson also told the ABC7 I-Team that they are discontinuing the use of that radio technology on their cards.
‘It’s not necessary wrong to pursue these techniques, but more needs to be done to safeguard people,’ said Mr Rotenberg.
A PURSE THAT FIGHTS CRIME: CLUTCH PROTECTS YOU FROM DIGITAL THEFT
A tech-savvy accessories label has launched a clutch purse with built-in capabilities to protect against identity theft.
Articulate‘s clutch costs $35 to pre-order and blocks RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) signals – the relatively new technology that allows us to simply wave our credit cards over a scanner to pay for goods.
According to the team behind the purse – entrepreneur Kevin and his sister Lindsay, based in San Diago, California – the clutch contains a ‘special material’ embedded into the design to help block these pesky RFID signals.
‘Criminals with very minimal technical skills have created devices similar to the scanner which vendors such as grocery stores use,’ the website description reads.
It comes in a range of colors and can also be worn over the shoulder thanks to the chain strap.
According to the United States Federal Trade Commission, identity theft had been holding steady for the last few years, having seen an increase of 21 per cent in 2008.",1
"With smart tech and sharp design, a new wave of budget hotels is sweeping away grisly memories of dull functionality. We review a selection of the latest openings across London
With smart tech and sharp design, a new wave of budget hotels is sweeping away grisly memories of dull functionality. We review a selection of the latest openings across London
ondon’s budget hotel sector is booming. The global financial crisis prompted a development spree among the big low-cost brands and, according to a Visit London report, the sector now represents 20% of the capital’s total hotel market (in comparison, hostels only represent 2%). Premier Inn has 72 hotels in Greater London, Travelodge has 67, Holiday Inn 38 and Ibis 24; and all brands continue to expand: a fifth Hub by Premier Inn is set to open on Goodge Street, Fitzrovia, for example; Ibis Styles is opening in west London; while Z hotels is adding Covent Garden and Soho to its collection of listed townhouses in 2018.
But development isn’t just about increasing the numbers; these brands have started to pay closer attention to design, meaning a stay in a budget hotel need not be the soul-destroying experience it once was. Ibis Styles, for example, has gone for a West End musical theme at its Southwark hotel; and at Motel One guests sip cocktails in a low-lit modern bar. Travelodge, however, could do with upping its game if it wants to compete with rivals on looks.
For those who still balk at the idea of a chain hotel, there has been a spate of independent openings aimed at the creative young, and young at heart – including the Green Rooms in Wood Green and the Good Hotel at Royal Victoria Dock – that are not just interesting venues but social enterprises aimed at helping local communities of artists and the unemployed respectively.
This is not a comprehensive list: the focus is on recently opened properties. There are other groups worth considering such as Imperial hotels, which has seven hotels in the Bloomsbury area, with rooms from 102 at its most recent, the Morton overlooking Russell Square. If you’re prepared to splash out a little more, Citizen M describes itself as “affordable luxury” and its three London properties are a step up in terms of cool factor – with rooms from 125, though nabbing that price could be a challenge. We have focused on the latest openings with rooms starting at under 100 a night.
What’s it like?
Taken over and refurbished in 2016 by Accor under its “economy and design” brand ibis Styles, this 114-room hotel manages to feel nothing like a budget chain. There’s no reception desk, just an iPad-wielding greeter in a space decked out with baby grand piano, repurposed theatre seats, vintage spotlights and gramophone horn light fittings. The West End musical theme continues upstairs: a keycard in a holder designed like a theatre ticket lets you into a room that, though budget-size, is huge fun thanks to red velvet drapes like stage curtains, a blowup monochrome photo of theatreland on one wall and a silhouette of a dancing girl on the bare-brick effect paper of another. Bowler hat lampshades, a retro phone and swivel chair add to the effect. The door to the compact shower room also makes the loo into a separate cubicle, so one partner can be showering or brushing teeth while the other is, ahem, enthroned.
What about breakfast and dinner?
Unlike the bedrooms and reception, the bar and restaurant have still not been refurbished from when this was the Southwark Rose hotel. Dinner is the usual “international” menu that few will bother with given the wealth of choice nearby. The buffet breakfast is substantial, with appealing extras such as french toast with a shot of maple syrup.
What’s on the doorstep?
It’s close to foodie hotspot Borough Market, but is just as handy for Tate Modern, Shakespeare’s Globe and Southwark Cathedral. London Bridge station/tube station and Southwark tube station (Jubilee line) are both less than half a mile away. Eating options within staggering distance of the hotel include new Portuguese cerveijaria-style Bar Douro, and the well-regarded restaurant at Menier Chocolate Factory, worth a trip for non-theatregoers for the calm that settles over the tables after punters go in to watch the show.
Value for money?
Impressive given the location and high style. Views of the Shard, with trains rumbling over the Thames, leave no doubt that you are close to the beating heart of a capital city.

What’s it like?
Five townhouses on Gloucester Place have been converted to create the biggest Z to date – and the sixth in London – a 94-bedroom hotel in Marylebone. The makeover is fairly minimalist: there is a lot of white, but it works. The bedrooms range from a windowless “inside queen” to the bigger king rooms and suites, and all feature large HD TVs. The breakfast and bar area is a light, informal space, with a big wooden communal table and a small outdoor courtyard, but it’s clear this isn’t a hotel for lounging around in; it lacks the cosy corners and sofas that suck you in at hipper boutique hotels. Still, it’s a lot cheaper than those.
What about breakfast and dinner?
Breakfast isn’t included, which always stings slightly. For 9 you can tuck in to a basic buffet of fresh pastries, cereals, fruit and yogurts and bacon sandwiches (the only hot option), which is a bit weak for the price. The Z Cafe is open throughout the day, selling sandwiches, wraps and salads for lunch. Dinner isn’t available, but between 5pm-8pm guests can max out on free wine and cheese, a good pre-theatre snack.
What’s on the doorstep?
It’s well-positioned for all the usual West End entertainment. For shopping, Selfridges (and Oxford Street) is a few minutes walk away; for art, stroll over to the Wallace Collection on Manchester Square (home of Frans Hals’ Laughing Cavalier). Options for fine dining are particularly good, with celeb haunt the Chiltern Firehouse, Michelin-starred Scandi eatery Texture and upmarket tapas restaurant Donostia all round the corner. All very Marylebone – if you want cheaper joints, take a 20-30 minute walk to Soho.
How much?
Doubles from 95; suites start at around 120. The Club suite room (from 195) comes with complimentary breakfast, drinks and snacks throughout the day, afternoon tea and cocktails.
Value for money?
For the location, yes. In this part of London many hotels are closer to 200 a night. If a simple, chic, hassle-free base for a break in the capital is your criteria, then this will serve you well.

What’s it like?
Big, and in the heart of west London – with High Street Kensington tube three minutes’ walk away. This 708-bedroom hotel, which reopened in December 2016, is one of the largest Holiday Inns in Europe. The cavernous building includes the Boulevard restaurant, a lounge bar and 13 meeting rooms, plus a gym, spa and 18-metre swimming pool, with steam room and whirlpool tub. The dining, bar and communal areas sprawl across the ground floor, where splashes of deep blue and red are added to an otherwise muted palette. The rooms – standard double, king, executive – opt for natural wood and beige tones. It’s all very sensible and perfectly anonymous. Along with a strong contingent of conference guests, the hotel has a family focus due to Holiday Inn’s policy that children under 12 stay and eat for free (maximum four per group).
What about breakfast and dinner?
A cooked breakfast costs 19.99, though it was offered for 15 during a perfunctory check-in. A cheaper continental breakfast is available. With many cafes nearby, though, a more affordable start to the day is only minutes away. However, a dinner menu and prices comparable with local chain restaurants encouraged me to try the Boulevard restaurant. The service was affable and attentive, and there were solidly produced staples such as Mac and Cheese (11) and fish and chips (14.50). Burgers start at 11, desserts from 6, and my two-course meal for two with drinks was less than 50.
What’s on the doorstep?
The recently relocated Design Museum – with its cafe, gift shop and Parabola bar/restaurant – is less than 10 minutes’ walk away, while Hyde Park, Kensington Palace and the Royal Albert Hall are close. South Kensington and its world-class museum-laden streets is a 20-minute walk or short bus journey away, and the West End is a 20-minute tube ride.
How much?
Doubles from 99, room-only. My standard double was so compact and bijou I couldn’t imagine lounging in it. However, it did manage to include a TV, desk, kettle, iron and ironing board, shower (no bath) and bottles of toiletries that weren’t bolted to the wall. Room service is 24-hours.
Value for money?
Reasonable for such a tourist-friendly location. Keep an eye out for extras that can bump up the cost, such as the hotel breakfast and (while the gym is free) the swimming pool/steam room, which costs 10 a day.

What’s it like
Part of a rapidly expanding 50-plus strong Munich-based chain, this design-oriented hotel on the eastern edge of the City offers a whopping 291 rooms over 15 floors. But with its simple layout and friendly bar area, it has the feel of a much smaller hotel. The wow factor is apparent immediately on entering, as guests pass through a modern lounge/bar area lit by stylish candelabras on their way to the reception desk. The bar serves subtle gin-based cocktails (the Earl Grey Marteani is a thing of beauty) and happy hours could turn into happy evenings here, especially given the array of comfy chairs in which to kick back before the digitally rendered 3-D logfire. Rooms are small but striking – with a don’t-try-this-at-home colour scheme of dark chocolate, aquamarine and off-whites. Rooms on the upper floors facing west offer night-time views of the City in all its vertiginous, kilowatt-burning glory. Ultra-modern bathrooms with fittings by Dornbracht and Hansgrohe, and comfortable beds, inject a shot of luxury.
What about breakfast and dinner?
There is no restaurant but a selection of (rather bland) toasties is available at the bar. For dinner, it’s worth knowing that local restaurants, such as the English-menu brasserie Abbey next door, offer 50% food discounts for Motel One customers (check with hotel staff for details). Opposite the hotel is the spacious Thai Square restaurant. Breakfast is reasonable value at 9.50, though fry-up fans will be disappointed. Granola is a Motel One speciality with more than five different types to choose from, and there’s a range of warm fresh breads and croissants on offer. The word “organic” crops up next to most of the items.
What’s on the doorstep?
The eastern edge of the City is somewhat nondescript despite its Roman and medieval roots. The glass and chrome has petered out but the culture and vibrant communities of east London are still a walk away. However, the familiar but spectacular tourist haunts of Tower Bridge, the Tower of London and HMS Belfast are a short walk away. From any of these, Shakespeare’s Globe, Borough Market and the other South Bank honeypots are a pleasant riverside stroll further on. Wilton’s Music Hall, and its eclectic performance arts programme, is half a mile to the east. A little further is Brick Lane and its curry houses (15 minutes’ walk) and, to the north, trendy Spitalfields and, beyond, Shoreditch (20 mins). For a truly dazzling meal or drink, the lofty bars and restaurants at the Sky Garden in the Walkie Talkie tower (20 Fenchurch St) are a 10-minute saunter away. Even closer is the cheery Bavarian Beerhouse if local pubs like Minories, aren’t your thing. A fun way to get to the West End, or east to Greenwich, is to take the Thames Clipper from Tower pier. The closest rail is the Docklands Light Railway station at Tower Gateway (handy for east London). The nearest tube is Aldgate at the top of Minories, with quick connections to the West End.
How much?
From 113 for a double; 98 for a single, room-only. There are deals for children to stay free in their parents’ room with breakfast included for under-6s. Free iPad loan.
Value for money?
Absolutely. Things could get messy if you have a taste for cocktails, but it would be tough to get this level of luxury for any less and although the eastern edge of the City is a tad bland, things get rapidly more exciting in most directions.

Taking inspiration from Japanese capsule hotels, the Hub is Premier Inn’s new high-tech offering. Guests book and check-in via an app – although there is a reception desk for those who prefer to do things the old-fashioned way. Low-key branding means it’s hard to spot the hotel on London’s Brick Lane – it’s only identifiable by a lime green sign outside. Once inside, you’re greeted by a row of touch screens – another way to check in – and an illuminated, interactive map of the area on the wall. A lounge area has ipads available for guests to use. Bedrooms are essentially sleeping pods where you use the app to control functions such as heating, lighting and TV. I slept like a baby but the room is so compact it’s not somewhere to dwell once you’re up and at it.
What about breakfast and dinner?
Unlimited caffeine is available from the coffee station in the small deli and bar area that also sells soups, sandwiches, snacks and drinks. The lack of restaurant hardly matters given the location on Brick Lane where you can breakfast on bagels and dine in some of London’s best curry houses, although there are many more options. I headed to Mooshies, a vegan burger joint down the road. It offers plant-based alternatives for around 7.50. Breakfast in the hub is disappointing – with porridge and drinks served in paper cups – and costs an extra 5.
What’s on the doorstep?
By day, art galleries – the Whitehapel gallery is the highest profile art space but there are plenty more art hubs to browse. Wander Spitalfields market for street food and new and second-hand clothes; or head to vintage stores, such as Blitz and Rokit, for a bigger selection of retro gear. By night, you’re spoilt for choice with a host of affordable places to eat and drink, this being the epicentre of the capital’s craft beer movement – all within walking distance. If you don’t want to spend your entire night propping up a bar, book a bowling session at All Star Lanes, then head for live music at 93 Feet East, both on Brick Lane.
Value for money?
It serves its purpose – but if you want charm or character look elsewhere.

What’s it like?
A 12-storey slab on Hoe Street, the main drag, almost over Walthamstow Central station (Victoria line and Overground) it looks pretty much like any other Travelodge – until you get upstairs. Ask for a room on one of the higher floors and enjoy millionaire views of the City, Canary Wharf and Olympic Park for a budget price. There aren’t many high rises in this part of north-east London, so the outlook is unrestricted. Staff are smiley and friendly, and the public transport superb: Kings Cross in 15 minutes; Oxford Circus or Liverpool Street in 20.
What about breakfast and dinner?
There is an in-house restaurant, serving exactly the sort of thing you’d expect from a budget chain, but you’re five minutes’ walk from thoroughly gentrified Walthamstow Village, with its restaurants, gastropubs and tapas and wine bars - plus two microbreweries and the Mother’s Ruin gin company. More up-and-coming than gentrified is Hoe Street itself, where dining options range from super-cheap dosas (from 3.45) at Maamala’s two minutes from the hotel, to modern European dishes (mains from 10) at Mirth Marvel and Maud, five minutes’ stroll away. The latter was Walthamstow’s 1930s cinema, and the conversion to cocktail bar, club, restaurant and theatre space has left much of the filmy feel intact, including silent movies playing on a screen over the foyer. Breakfast is a standard chain hotel buffet, though the fruit salad is fresher than many. More discerning caffeine addicts will enjoy independent Incoming Coffee, right next door on Station Approach (if you find yourself at the Costa, you’ve overshot).
What’s on the doorstep?
Recently semi-pedestrianised Walthamstow Village has a 15th-century church and old timbered houses, almshouses nearly as old, and an engaging free museum in the former workhouse. Half a mile to the north is 2013 museum of the year the William Morris Gallery, where the designer and socialist grew up, with displays of his work and interesting temporary exhibitions (Frank Brangwyn and the Art of Japan until 14 May).
Value for money
Excellent, for somewhere within such easy reach of central London. Head for the West End after 9.30am and return after 7pm (with an Oyster card) and you’ll pay less than 6 per adult.

What’s it like?
Converted from a 1930s art-deco pile and opened in summer 2016, this social enterprise hotel – set up by talent from the likes of Hoxton Hotel and Clapton indie digs Russell’s – aims to attract creatives to an as-yet ungentrified part of north London. The minimalist rooms may lack TVs, phones and an abundance of space, but they make up for it with on-trend furniture and firm beds. Only four of the rooms are en suite, leaving the rest of the guests to use the communal toilets and showers, which are tiled and characterful. Upstairs there’s a gallery space perfect for rehearsals, talks and live performances, while on the ground floor is a large communal area, with lots of scope for lounging with a cocktail, craft Beavertown beer, or excellent-value wine. With preferential rates for artists and partnerships with the likes of Somerset House and the Royal Court, you’re likely to end up arguing over Brechtian dramaturgy or post-internet art in the lift.
What about breakfast and dinner?
Breakfast is a continental affair of croissants, toast or granola, but dinner at the downstairs restaurant, not included in the price, is well worth getting stuck into. Every six months a new chef is mentored and given a chance to run their own kitchen – during my stay it was the turn of Colombian Street Kitchen, whose Esteban Arboleda serves up silky ceviche, beans, and brilliant fried things such as arepa (corn pancakes) and patacones (plantain fritters).
What’s on the doorstep?
Central London is surprisingly quick to get to: Wood Green tube station is one minute from the hotel, and then it’s 24 minutes to Piccadilly Circus. But if you want to stay in the area, the king of Turkish ocakbasi restaurants that dominate this part of town is Gokyuzu & Kervan, serving immaculately grilled lamb, meze salads and turnip juice. If you want to avoid the chain pubs, try the Lord Nelson (232 High Road, Bowes Park). For some exercise, stride up to Alexandra Palace for views, or to the smart Omnida studios for yoga and pilates.
How much?
Doubles from 66, en suite doubles 84, studio apartments 108. Artists get 12 off these rates. All B&B.
Value for money?
Yep. These prices would be good value for a pretty ordinary B&B in a regional town – for chic digs in London, where you can easily pay 100 for access to a small dingy moth sanctuary, they’re basically unbeatable.

What’s it like?
This budget venue floats at London’s docklands and its name reflects a charitable mission: to help the local community, by hiring long-term unemployed people in the area. Outside it looks like a shipping container, accessible via a footbridge that is brightly lit up at night. Inside, it is dimly lit with sofas and tables hidden behind walls or in an open-plan central area. There are books to read, a view of the dock to enjoy, and you can lounge about in the restaurant-bar. Hailing from Amsterdam, the Good Hotel was transported by a submersible barge via the North Sea.
What about breakfast and dinner?
The menu offers unusual sandwiches (a buttermilk chicken, fried egg, maple syrup) plus burgers: beef or pulled pork will set you back 13, while a vegetarian one costs 11. The buffet breakfast costs 13.50pp and features all the regulars: porridge, muesli, cheese, bread, pastries with eggs to order and a good selection of coffee and juices.
What’s on the doorstep?
ExCel London, which hosts a variety of events such as the London Boat Show, is a mere 400 metres away. Even closer is the Emirates cable car (single tickets: adult 3.50, child 1.70), which will shuttle you across to North Greenwich where you can go to the O2 arena and its indoor bowling alley. From there the Jubilee Line or Thames Clipper hydrofoils will whisk you into London, or a short bus ride will take you to the nautical attractions of Greenwich, a Unesco world heritage site. Back on the doorstep is The Pilot, a music-themed pub where you can eat, too.
How much?
Smaller doubles start from 65 room only. Rooms with river views cost more. Breakfast extra.
Value for money?
Definitely. The rooms are lovely and are among the best that similarly priced chain hotels offer. The views are magnificent, so it may be worthwhile to pay a bit extra to overlook the water. Also, proceeds either go back into the business supporting people in the local community or towards charitable causes.

"Skin diseases and problems are quite common in people of all age groups and the treatment for them can be pretty delicate.
Skin tags, moles, warts, age spots, andblackheads are some of the skin diseases you may be facing, although there are about 3,000 different skin issues one can experience.
Every skin change, in color, texture or smell could be a potential health problem, and you need to act quickly to treat it. Pharmaceutical meds are available for use and treatment, but can sometimes act harshly and aggressively on the skin.
To protect yourself from skin irregularities and from chemical medications, there are a few homemade recipes that can get you a healthy and glowing skin in no time.
Below you will find some of the most effective home remedies for the most frequent skin diseases, which are both cheap and effective:
Click Here!
Moles
Moles occur on the skin but do not represent a serious health threat. When a mole begins to change in color or size, it may be a clear symptom of cancer.
However, you can get rid of moles by using crushed garlic topically and letting it act for four hours a day. Another solution you can try is apple cider vinegar- it doesn’t have the power of the garlic, but it can be useful. Here are the best home remedies for treating moles:
Garlic
Either garlic extract or raw garlic can be very productive for mole treatment. Make sure to clear the skin around the mole with masking tape or petroleum jelly. For a more natural option choose beeswax and oil instead of petroleum jelly. Apply topically and bandage the mole. Repeat until you see positive results.
Castor Oil and Baking Soda
Mix both ingredients until they form a paste and apply topically onto mole. Bandage area and leave paste to work overnight. The following morning, rinse skin well. Repeat each night until you see improvement.
Apple Cider Vinegar
Use a cotton ball soaked in apple cider vinegar and apply directly on the mole. Bandage the area and leave the ACV to act for eight hours. Repeat until mole begins to darken and falls off.
Warts
Small, but tricky- warts are derived as a result of the human papillomavirus or HPV. Normally the treatment involves salicylic acid or freezing. In some cases, wrapping warts into duct tape is also helpful. However, here are other treatments that might help you get rid of warts:
Bananas
Bananas may be the fastest way for a wart-free skin. Rub wart with banana peel every night and repeat treatment until the wart disappears. It usually takes up to two weeks to see results.
Pure Raw Honey
Raw honey, rubbed directly on the wart can be a very effective way to dispose of it. Wrap skin with bandage after applying it. When warts are treated with raw honey, they have very small changes of reoccurring.
Apple Cider Vinegar
Apply apple cider vinegar each night onto wart by using a cotton ball soaked in the liquid. Bandage area and leave it overnight. Rinse and repeat process until the wart fades.
Garlic
Garlic can deal with warts in only 14 days, if used raw or juiced. Rub garlic onto wart each night and wrap area well. For best results, apply garlic juice twice a day.
Skin Tags
Skin tags usually surface on the skin around your neck, upper chest, underarms, and eyelids. Skin rubbing is the most common cause for skin tags to occur. Standardly, they are treated with tying off, cutting off, and freezing. But, here are some more natural and mellow ways to deal with them:
Apple Cider Vinegar
Use a cotton ball soaked in ACV and squeezed from extra liquid. Tap the affected area and leave it on for some ime. It takes a couple of days for the skin tag to darken and fall off.
Tea Tree Oil
Add tea tree oil drops on a water-soaked cotton ball. Press on affected area and bandage well. Repeat treatment 2-3 times per day for a whole month. If you are persistent the effects will be great.
Baking Soda and Castor Oil
This mixture also comes in handy for treating skin tags. For a paste by mixing both ingredients and apply on skin tag. Bandage well and repeat process 2-3 times a day. Store paste in fridge for the next 48 hours.
Dark Spots
Dark spots on the skin come with age and may appear on the limbs or the face. The cause for this skin occurrence is not clear, although it is linked with liver irregularities and sun exposure.
Here is how you can treat them: Age spots or dark spots are discolored patches on the skin on the face, hands and forearms. Although their cause is still not clear, many doctors believe that they occur as a result of sun exposure and an aging liver. Here is what you can use to treat them:
Lemon
Lemon has properties that are able to fade the dark spots. Soak a cotton ball and rub on dark spots two times a day.
Aloe Vera
Use raw Aloe Vera on dark spot and let it act for 30 minutes. You can grow this plant at home and apply the gel inside the leaves.
Onion
Onions are very healthy for many purposes, and removing dark spots in one of them. Juice or blend onion and apply directly onto dark spot. Let remedy soak for 10-15 minutes, and then rinse well. Repeat until dark spots fade.
Horseradish
To get best effects, mix horseradish with vinegar and apply onto dark spot on a daily basis. In time, you will notice improvement and the dark spot will vanish.
Vitamin C Serums
Homemade Vitamin C serums are ideal for removing dark spots. Apply topically onto dark spots and results will follow shortly. This is also good for eliminating other damaged skin tissue as well.
Cleansing Clogged Pores
When the skin is in contact with outer dirt the pores tend to get clogged and the skin breathing is interrupted. To get glowing and soft skin, without any inflammation, here is what you can do:
Sugar Scrub
Form a paste from mixing sugar and lemon. Rub onto skin with organic cotton ball. Use circular motion to massage skin. Once done, rinse well with warm water.
Steaming
Water steam can be very productive in providing you with shiny and cleansed skin. First, you’re your face well. Place face over boiling water. Cover head with a towel, for ultimate effect.
Steam for 10 to 15 minutes. Make sure to be exposed to the steam as much as possible. When done, wash face and rinse well with lukewarm water. To remove any extra dirt, apply vinegar.",1

"Diverticulitis is a disease caused by small pouches called diverticula in the colon (or large intestine) that bulge outward. The presence of diverticula alone results in a diagnosis of diverticulosis, a condition that’s often manageable without medical treatment and sometimes causes discomforts such as mild cramps, bloating, and constipation.
The risk of diverticulosis increases with age, and it affects about half of all men and women over the age of 60, though many are undiagnosed. Most patients are unaware that they have diverticulosis until it’s noticed on a routine colonoscopy. In most cases, it’s managed with increased fiber intake and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed.
However, if diverticula become infected, a patient receives a diagnosis of diverticulitis, which needs more aggressive treatment and can result in serious complications if left undetected.
WHY YOU SHOULD WATCH YOUR SALT INTAKE
Often diagnosed by a physical exam or imaging after symptoms have begun, diverticulitis causes more pressing symptoms, including abdominal pain (often on the left side), fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, cramps, and constipation.
In its early stages, it’s treated with antibiotics to address the infection, but if left untreated, complications such as bleeding, tears, and blockages can develop. Complications sometimes need to be treated with a hospital stay and/or surgery, and many patients recovering from a bout of diverticulitis are put on pain medications and a liquid diet in addition to antibiotics.
No one’s sure what causes diverticulitis, but it’s probably a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include aging, weight gain, being male, and of course, having a diagnosis of diverticulosis.
Research into whether fiber intake affects your risk of developing diverticulitis is conflicted, but it’s clear that increased fiber intake, along with weight loss and regular exercise, plays a significant role in preventing relapses once your body has had a chance to recover.
Immediately following a flare up of diverticulitis, it’s important to give your colon as much of a break as possible. This is why liquid diets are often recommended after severe episodes, and in extreme cases, IV nutrition is used to give the intestines a complete rest.
Once you’ve been given the green light to eat solid food, it’s important to maintain a low-fiber diet until your body has had a chance to recover.
This may seem counter-intuitive since a high fiber diet is an important part of reducing your risk of relapse, but you can gradually increase your fiber intake after your colon has healed. In the immediate aftermath of diverticulitis, you want to keep your fiber intake as low as possible.
Vegetables in this family are nutrition powerhouses and very high in fiber. They’re excellent food for people without diverticulitis but should be avoided during your recovery. The family includes broccoli, cauliflower, arugula, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. These foods also contain fermentable sugars that produce gas, stimulating your digestive tract.
Whole grain bread, pasta, and rice are normally great healthy choices, but they’re too hard to digest for your recovering intestines. Put them in the freezer for now, but don’t throw them out! They’ll be an important part of your diet after recovery.
3. Oatmeal and Other Cereals High in Fiber
A bowl of oatmeal in the morning is touted as one of the healthiest breakfasts around, but not for your healing digestive tract. It’s a meal full of healthy calories, but it’s also very high in fiber.
You may have heard that nuts, seeds, and skins should be avoided by anyone who has ever had diverticulitis because they can easily get caught in diverticula and cause infection, but research doesn’t back this up. Theyshouldbe avoided in the recovery period because of their high fiber content, but feel free to reintroduce them as you increase your fiber intake.
Keep in mind that, as odd as it seems, the foods you want to avoid in the immediate aftermath of diverticulitis are exactly the foods that you should be eating plenty of once you’re recovered in order to keep further flare ups at bay. Work with your doctor to develop a diet plan and to determine when you’re ready to start slowly including high fiber foods in your diet.

Onychomycosis is medical name for toenail fungus. It is characterized by pain, inflammation and swelling of the toe, as well as yellowing, thickening, and crumbling of the nail itself. In most cases, toenail fungus is caused by abnormal pH of the skin, continuous exposure to moisture, wearing synthetic socks, weakened immune system, sweat build – up in shoes, poor foot hygiene or weak circulation.
Modern medicine treats toenail fungus with topical treatments, oral anti – fungal medicine, and in some cases surgical removal of the nail. In many cases there are side effects of these medications which include trouble breathing, swelling of the mouth or face, hives, rashes, blisters, headaches, dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite, liver damage, weight gain, fatigue, heart problems, fever, diarrhea and more pain. We can say that all those conditions indirectly are caused by fungus on your toenails.

"All Honesty Scott-Grayson had to do was see it.
On the flight to Waco, Texas, last Thursday, she was already envisioning herself wearing a Baylor uniform, bright yellow trim and all, as she chased an NCAA championship in the coming years. She and her mother Makiesha Scott, who goes by Kiesha, just wanted to make sure the program and campus felt like home. Soonce Honesty saw the crisp green lawns, shiny brick buildings and Baylor Coach Kim Mulkey lead a spirited practice, she was ready to solidify her next step and verbally commit to Baylor.
“I was relieved,” said Honesty, who announced her decision to play for the Lady Bears on Twitter on Tuesday night. “I felt like a weight was lifting off my shoulders and all the pressure of where I was going to go. It was just very relaxing after that, didn’t have to really stress about anything any more.”
Honesty, a five-star guard who is 18th in ESPN’s Class of 2018 rankings, transferred to Riverdale Baptist before her senior year. The New Jersey native started her high school career at Riverdale, returned home to New Jersey to attend Blair Academy for her sophomore year, then transferred to Paul VI in Fairfax as a junior. But Honesty, who has spent years trying to find the right basketball fit, wanted to finish her high school career where it started.
[Three transfers, four years: A star and her mom navigate high-stakes basketball recruiting]
Next she will start her college career at Baylor.The Lady Bearswill get a highly talented combo guard who can run the point, space the floor from the wing and weave through defenses with polishedballhandling skills. Honesty’s 5-foot-10 frame and long arms also make her a versatile defender capable of guarding up to four positions. She took official visits to Ohio State, Ole Miss and finally Baylor this past weekend, and her decisionultimately came down towanting to play for the Lady Bears’ head coach.
“Mainly, it was about Kim Mulkey,” Honesty said Monday. “She’s a great coach. I could relate to her, she’s explosive and I think she’ll bring the best out of me and overall she’s just a great person.”
From sixth grade on, Honesty’s basketball career was firmly situated on the fast track. When she was 12 years old, she played with 16- and 17-year-old girls on the New York Gauchos’ top team in Nike’s Elite Youth Basketball League. Ohio State became the first school to recruit her and others soon followed. At 13, she was an eighth grader starting at point guard for Life Center Academy’s high school varsity team.
That pressure, at times amplified in high school by her transfer decisions, led her and her mom to take things slower during her college recruitment process.
“I learned so much with the high school part, with the transferring and stuff like that, we really wanted to take our time with this college thing,” Kiesha said Monday. “I wasn’t going to rush and have her commit in 9th or 10th grade or anything like that. I wanted to take my time and let it all pan out and work itself out. And I think in this situation, it worked out to perfection with Baylor.”
Honesty and Kiesha traveled to Waco this past weekendto confirm a decision that was just about made. Honesty could see herself thriving in Baylor’s up-tempo style of play. Kiesha could relate to Mulkey in a lot of ways: they are both devoted mothers with a girl and boy, fiery around the court, measured and introspective away from it.
On Saturday night, as one of the last events of the official visit, they went to Mulkey’s house for a party. They were joined by the whole Baylor coaching staff, players from the current team and one other recruit who was visiting over the weekend. There was a DJ. The girls did karaoke while the parents judged their performances. They played Pictionary. They ate and danced and, above all else, they celebrated a pledge Honesty had always dreamed of making, then finally did the day before.
“Baylor is for me,” Honesty remembers telling Mulkey. “This is where I want to go. I want you to coach me.”

"A romance novel can be so much more than just ""boy meets girl, feelings ensue,"" and romance authors know it — so there are lots of love stories out there packed with twists and turns on the way to happily-ever-after. Here are three that have fun with literary conventions: A classic Regency plot reimagined as a sexy, pop-culture driven contemporary romance. An epic story of revenge, war and deception cast as a comedy. And one of literature's legendary heroes gets gender-swapped. It's never boring in Romancelandia!
In The Betting Vow by K. M. Jackson, what happens in Vegas definitely does not stay in Vegas. Leila Darling is a supermodel with a temper and aspirations to be taken seriously as an actress. Carter Bain is a television executive in charge of launching a new network. To do that, he needs a star — someone like Leila. In this third and final book of Jackson's Unconventional Brides series, the mechanism for getting the couple together is wonderfully absurd — a high stakes, late night card game leads to a wager of marriage — but it's the start of a fine romance. If they wed, Leila will get the image overhaul she needs and a chance to act in Bain's shows while Bain himself will get the star power he needs to launch his network successfully.
The set up requires some suspension of disbelief, but the romance feels real. Bain and Leila navigate learning to trust and getting to know each other while battling a simmering attraction and a close-quarters living situation. And while Jackson clearly delights in contemporary pop culture — she blends tabloids, TV and romance beautifully — the novel also has echoes of classic Regency romance tropes like wagering a woman in a card game, and a marriage of convenience. It all adds up to a satisfying romance that shows a wedding is just the beginning of happy ever after.
Light on romance but loaded with suspense, Sherry Thomas' A Conspiracy In Belgravia is a riveting and absorbing read. It's the second book in her Lady Sherlock series, which imagines that Sherlock Holmes is actually Miss Charlotte Holmes, a ""fallen"" woman with a brilliant mind and penchant for eating desserts (which Thomas describes deliciously).
The story begins with a not unappealing proposal of marriage from Lord Bancroft, brother to Lord Ingram, with whom Charlotte has something of a romantic past. Matters are complicated when Lord Ingram's wife comes to Sherlock Holmes with a mystery about an old lover who happens to be Charlotte's missing half brother, and an unidentified dead body appears that may or may not be connected. While probably best enjoyed after reading the first book in the series, A Conspiracy in Belgravia is a beautifully written novel; you'll savor the unraveling of the mystery and the brilliance of its heroine just as Miss Holmes savors all those desserts.
Finally, So I Married a Sorcerer by Kerrelyn Sparks is an utterly charming and delightful romance. The second book in her Embraced Series — described as Game of Thrones meets The Princess Bride — pairs an infamous pirate with a long lost princess in a story full of deception, danger, and fire breathing dragons. Oh, and it's a comedy.
Rupert is the most feared pirate in Aerthlan due to his ability to command the wind (Gotta love a hero with magical powers). His goal is simple: kidnap the long lost princess of Tourin, and use her to enact revenge on her half-brother, the King, who is legitimately The Worst Ever. As befitting a romance heroine, Princess Brigitta has ""crazy"" notions about getting to choose her destiny, and it doesn't involve being kidnapped and ransomed. Yet sparks fly between this ""sorcerer of the wind"" and this charmingly ""overly dramatic"" heroine who has some special powers of her own. After falling in love on the High Seas, they realize — naturally — that love might be the best revenge after all, making for a fast-paced story with tons of twists and turns that'll leave you guessing right up to the end just how Rupert and Brigitta will pull off a happily-ever-after.",0

"British businessman James McCormick who sold the hand-held wands to Iraq was jailed for fraud some yearsago.
The suicide car bombing, which was claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, ripped through a busy shopping in the early hours and also wounded more than 180 people, officials said.
Abadi’s orders highlight one of the longest-running and most grievous flaws in Baghdad security: the continued use of fake bomb detectors at checkpoints years after the man who sold them to Iraq was jailed in Britain for fraud.
The premier ordered all security forces to stop using the hand-held devices, which are made of black plastic with a pistol-style grip and a small silver antenna that allegedly detects various materials including explosives.
In reality, they do not detect anything, except by chance.
Abadi also directed that the interior ministry speed up the deployment of the “Rapiscan device for searching vehicles” at all entrances to Baghdad – an apparent reference to truck-based scanners from Rapiscan Systems.
He also ordered security personnel manning checkpoints not to use their mobile phones while on duty – a frequent occurrence that reduces the effectiveness of the many checkpoints scattered around Baghdad.
Other measures include stepping up aerial reconnaissance and intelligence efforts, increasing coordination among security forces and reorganising checkpoints in the capital.
It remains to be seen how many of the new measures will in fact be carried out, as changes have been announced by Iraqi authorities before but not implemented on the ground.",1
"The Freddie Gray protests against police in Baltimore also showed how valuable Periscope can be for watching news as it unfolds. Guardian journalist Paul Lewis spoke to people in the streets via Periscope, giving them an unfiltered platform to share directly with his audience what they thought of the situation. Unencumbered by large TV cameras, Lewis was able to livestream as he moved around the city, bringing viewers powerful images like a community housing project going up in flames.
On a lighter note, you can also use Periscope to accompany a celebrity to Friday night drinks or go behind the scenes on a TV show. Ellen DeGeneres, Mariah Carey, Jimmy Fallon, Chris Hardwick and Tyra Banks are among celebs who use Periscope to connect with their fans. Other celebs like Madonna use Meerkat, a similar live-streaming app. So if you've ever wanted to see what it's like to walk out from backstage onto the set of a late night talk show, you can on Periscope.
CNN's Richard Quest talks to viewers via Periscope on election night in London.
And, finally, you can tour a city you've never been to. On election night in the UK, CNN's Richard Quest was riding around London on the top level of a double-decker bus, pointing out the sights as he interviewed experts about the results. He was broadcasting for CNN, but between shots he turned to his phone and answered questions, introduced viewers to the experts and gave guided tours through Parliament Square and Piccadilly Circus. I held his phone, read out questions and watched as viewers from around the world commented to say thanks for giving them an inside look at London on election night.
Intimacy
One thing about Periscope: It's not a passive medium. Viewers aren't just watching; they're totally involved in the broadcast.
When Max Foster was ""scoping"" outside St. Mary's, viewers were in control of the conversation, and they had a direct line to tell him what they wanted through the app's comments. Foster answered questions they had about the royal family, bringing in other reporters from the press pool to weigh in as well. And when viewers wanted to meet some of the royal superfans that were camped outside the hospital, he picked up his phone and took them over.
Max Foster shows Periscope viewers the area where hardcore royal fans camped out before the birth of Princess Charlotte.
""I was responding to the questions that people were asking and things that I wouldn't think to have covered, so that was useful,"" said Foster. ""They were also directing me around the area. So they wanted to see a statue, for example, I'd show them a statue. Or if they wanted to speak to a particular person, I'd take them over to that person. They wanted to meet one of the royal fans who had become quite well known on TV, so I took them over and had a chat with them.""
And then, of course, there's the hearts. Viewers of a Periscope live stream can tap the screen to send multicolored hearts to the broadcaster, letting them know in a flurry of color that they like what they're currently seeing.
Periscope users can tap the screen to send hearts to the broadcaster. Here, a flurry goes up during one of Foster's broadcasts.
""It shows what you're doing is right,"" said Foster. ""Getting 70,000 hearts, it's something you know you're doing right. ... I'm doing something that people do find useful.""
Design
Since the invention of the cameraphone, video editors and the generally design-conscious have pleaded with people to turn their phones horizontally to shoot video. Anti-vertical video PSAs have gone viral.
Periscope is optimized for vertical video.
But Periscope -- which is completely designed for use on your phone rather than a browser or TV -- unabashedly embraces the much-maligned vertical video format. Meerkat and Snapchat are also optimized for portrait-mode video. I asked Periscope co-founder Kayvon Beykpour why he decided to go against the grain.
""We had this observation that people use their phones in the vertical format and we thought that was the most natural way to start the Periscope experience,"" he explained. ""People are becoming more comfortable with vertical video.""
Beykpour added that he's not ""religious"" about it, and that Periscope will support landscape video ""at some point.""
Still, it's a major turning point for the media industry, which will have to figure out how to make use of all this vertical video instead of simply dismissing it as bad design.
Laws and ethics
Live-streaming apps like Periscope are the new Google Glass -- a scary and unknown new frontier of legal and ethical issues.
Periscope: Top tips
Nope, no need to turn your phone -- the app is optimized for vertical video.
Stream something you have a unique view of. Top of a mountain? Exclusive event? Remote city? Yes please.
...But don't broadcast anything you don't have permission to show! (This means you, Game of Thrones fans.)
Let viewers direct the broadcast. Answer questions; show them something again if they've missed it.
Archive your broadcasts so people can view them up to 24 hours after they were live.
People who wanted to watch May 2's much-publicized Mayweather-Pacquiao boxing match were supposed to pay either thousands of dollars for tickets or $100 to watch it via pay-per-view. But on the night, a third option popped up: Periscope. Dozens of fans streamed it live on the app for free (and illegally). HBO had the same problem just days earlier when 'scopers streamed the Game of Thrones premiere.
Beykpour didn't seem too concerned about this, saying that Periscope isn't exactly the ideal way to watch Game of Thrones.
""It's just not a good experience -- it's not going to be something that plagues the ecosystem,"" he said.
Still, he emphasized that ""we have always had a process in place to handle (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) take-down requests. We've made it clear to our partners and have stated that we respect intellectual property.""
Seeing the threat from live-streaming apps, some sporting leagues are taking swift action. Broadcaster Stephanie Wei, who reports for FoxSportsAsia and Sports Illustrated, said she had her PGA Tour credentials revoked after using Periscope to stream a practice round of a golf event.
Journalist Stephanie Wei, center, says she had her PGA Tour credentials revoked after Periscoping from a tour event.
""Everything just felt so natural, almost as if not live-streaming it would be missing an opportunity to do my job in a more informative way,"" she wrote in a blog post. ""The response to the streams (from fans) was tremendous and overwhelmingly positive. I thought about the possibilities and how Periscope could be a major game-changer in enhancing media coverage of practice rounds leading up to the tournament days.""
""I understand and respect that the Tour needs to protect its broadcasting partners that pay for TV rights,"" she added, ""but it's time to adjust to the current, ever-changing media landscape and how people -- its customers -- consume golf content, especially for content that isn't going to be broadcast by a partner.""
And rights issues aren't the only legal and ethical problem live-streaming apps are facing. What happens if a whistleblower decides to secretly broadcast a board meeting, for example? Or, on a more basic level, can you get in trouble for Periscoping as you walk down the street?
Paul Lewis, the Guardian journalist who Periscoped from Baltimore, ran into trouble at one point when bystanders weren't happy with his live-streaming of the scene. When he suddenly disconnected, viewers began to worry for his safety. He later tweeted, ""it ended okay. Folks didn't like me filming them, I left, quick, and I'm fine.""
Periscope co-founder Kayvon Beykpour hopes a broadcast from Antarctica will soon show up on the app.
As Periscope grows, new issues will come up, but Beykpour is sure the community will ""will continue to blow our minds."" The platform recently had its first broadcast from North Korea, and Beykpour said ""we had to do a double-take."" What's he hoping for next?
""I'd love to see a broadcast from Antarctica. I think that's the only country or territory we have not covered,"" he said.

"Saggy and droopy eyelids can be really annoying and makeup often looks unattractive on loose skin. Droopy eyelids may even make a person look much older.
In general, droopy eyelids are a result of the natural process of aging, but they can also be caused by an injury in the area, nerve damage, or even some diseases.
One of the best natural treatments for this issue consists of eggs. Eggs have been a common treatment for numerous issues for hundreds of years, especially as beauty care products.
Click Here!
Eggs have been frequently used to relieve scars, prevent acne and dark spots, remove blackheads, as a hair mask, as a hydrating skin mask, to tighten the skin around the eyes, and much more.
This is what to do in order to naturally treat droopy eyes:
Wash the face well and remove all makeup, then dry it. Remove the yolk of one egg, and use a cotton swab to apply the egg whites on the eyelids. Do this carefully in order to prevent it from entering the eyes, and keep the eyes closed until the white is completely dry. Afterward, wash it off with lukewarm water and dry it with a towel.
Since this treatment is fully natural, you can use it on a daily basis. You will notice the first effects after only a few days.

"Epsom salt, typically used in baths for sore and achy muscles, has proven itself to be more than basic. Also known as magnesium sulfate, it contains the minerals magnesium and sulfur, both found to be beneficial to plants.
In case you weren’t aware, Epsom salt is considered a BFF for many gardeners. If you’re looking to earn a green thumb, or just want to use less chemicals outdoors, check out these ways that you can use Epsom salt outside.
1.Pest Control
Epsom salt in your flower bed or garden can help keep pests like snails, slugs, or groundhogs away. Try sprinkling some around your plants, or make a spray solution with 2 tablespoons of Epsom salt and 1 gallon of warm water.
2.Greener Lawns
Even Bob Vila cosigned on this one. For greener grass, spread Epsom salt around your lawn with a seed spreader or by hand.
3. Weed KillerNip weeds in the bud with a few shots of this mixture: 1 gallon of white vinegar, 2 cups Epsom salt, and  cup of dish soap. Spray it directly onto the weeds; dish soap helps it to cling while the salt dehydrates the weeds. Extra tip: vinegar with 10% acidity or higher works the best.
4.Big Pepper and Tomato Yield
A favorite of pepper and tomato growers, Epsom salt can boost the size, flavor, and amount grown in the garden. Used dry, toss some at the base of the plant, 1 tablespoon for each foot of height; water immediately. Applied every 2 weeks, this foliar spray recipe will also do the trick: 1 – 2 tablespoons Epsom salt + 1 gallon of water in a spray bottle.
5.Sweeter Fruit
Home gardeners and small farmers have taken to using Epsom salt for vibrant, sweeter crops. Cantaloupes benefit from a handful sprinkled in the soil during the last few weeks of growth. Peaches, strawberries, watermelons, and citrus can also get a dose in the soil or foliar spray every 2 weeks. Seasoned growers report sweeter fruit with greener foliage.
6.Leaf Revitalizer
Notice that the leaves on your plants are curly or yellow? Remedy cases of magnesium deficiency with either a spritz or sprinkling of Epsom salt. Spray the leaves directly with the recipe above or add a handful and water it into the soil.
7. Trees
For you folks with palm trees in your yards, add 1-2 cups of Epsom salt around the trunks to prevent yellowing and drying. To get rid of tree stumps, drill holes all over the stump, about 8 inches deep. Fill the holes with Epsom salt and add just enough water to moisten. Cover the stump with a tarp or dirt. This process will dry and rot out the stump.
8. Rosier Roses
Gardeners cheer the results of Epsom salt for richly colored roses. Before planting new bushes, soak the roots in  cup Epsom salt dissolved in 1 gallon of water. When in bloom, rake 1 tablespoon into the soil at the base and water it, once per month. Use foliar spray 1 – 2 times per month.
9.Soil Nourisher
Epsom salt feeds soil because of its magnesium and sulfur content. It contributes to nutrient intake, chlorophyll production, and many farmers and gardeners find it to be an outstanding fertilizer. It’s good for household plants too!
10.The Germinator
Adding 1 – 2 tablespoons of Epsom salt to the soil before planting will help with seed germination and transplant shock. Simply add it in the bottom of the hole and cover it with a little bit of soil before planting new seeds or seedlings.
11.Outdoor Woes
While you’re outside putting in all this work, you might encounter any one of these outdoor hazards: sunburn, poison ivy, or bee stings. Tame them all with Epsom salt compresses. Dip a washcloth in a cup of water with 2 tablespoons of dissolved Epsom salt.
Epsom salt is another one of those household staples that wears many hats. Now, you can let others know how your garden grows so well! Note: it’s wise to test your soil for low magnesium levels before drenching it with an Epsom salt mix. You can do it yourself with a soil testing kit or check with your local county extension office.

"This luscious little salad delivers serious crunch. The crisp juicy cucumber marries the toasty rye croutons and the whole crackling affair is coated in velvety dilly sour cream dressing. Pickled shallots, capers, and feta deliver tart and salty punches with each bite, leaving you wanting more.
This recipe came about from my combined love of summery cucumber salads and rye cucumber sandwiches. I wondered if there was a way to combine the two and beef up my usual light cucumber salad to turn into something more substantial, hearty, and packed with bolder flavors. This salad is the result and I’m so pleased with it. It pairs well alongside grilled trout or wild salmon, but also holds up perfectly well on its own.
Now. A few words on cucumbers… and sour cream… and pickled shallots. First, the sour cream. Please use full-fat, real sour cream if you make this recipe. I can think of few things that are as guaranteed to ruin a dish as the low-fat, artificially-soured gunk that tries to pass for “sour cream” on so many grocery store shelves. I will spare you a longer rant on the topic, but just trust me on this one. Life is too short for low-fat, artificially-soured cream. As for the pickled shallots… if you’re tempted to skip these, allow me a few words in their defense: yes, they do need to be made ahead but they take literally minutes to prepare and then all they have to do is marinate for a bit.
This salad is just not the best possible version of itself without them. They give it pizazz. The pickling mellows the onion flavour and leaves you with sweet tart goodness. (In a pinch, use red onions instead of shallots).
And finally, our dear friends the cukes. I encourage you to explore what’s available at your local farmer’s market and to use local and organic cucumbers if you can. Conventional cucumbers are repeatedly shown to be high in pesticide residues and it’s one of the vegetables that I highly recommend buying organic whenever possible. Plus there’s nothing like a fresh-off-the-vine juicy crunchy cucumber!
Finally, be sure to slice up the rye croutons and the cucumber cubes quite finely. Small, delicate bite-sized cubes make for a nicer presentation and offer up better bites (with better crunch!) that aren’t unwieldy.
Do let me know if you make this salad in the comments below. Bon appétit!

"Everyone who plans a trip to Cuba gets the same advice: you’ll love the country but hate the food. Between ingredient shortages, import restrictions, and a lack of Internet connectivity to help people find local gems, the Cuban food scene is legitimately difficult to navigate. But just like everything else on this arresting island, access to the government’s inner circle can unlock the country’s gastronomic treasures.
With that in mind, we asked one of Fidel Castro’s private chefs, Ivan Justo, to open up his little black book to Havana,where restaurants are most plentiful and travelers more likely to visitfirst. Theseare the places, he suggests, that will redeem his home town’s culinary cred once and for all.
Call a week ahead to get into this hotspot in Vedado because it’s unusually busy by Havana standards. Seating is on the open roof, where the vibe gradually shifts from breezy to blingy as the night goes on. Join a young crowd of affluent expats and sophisticated locals for grilled lobster and cocktails (there’s no menu—just tell the bartender what you like), then head next door to Fabrica D’Arte, a peanut oil factory-turned-contemporary art gallery that Justo frequents for its range of up-and-coming Cuban artists.
A Swedish-inspired restaurant in Central Havana? Believe it. This whitewashed spot a few blocks from the shore serves dishes from both countries: Think Swedish meatballs and Cuban lamb stew. To drink: strong, well-made daiquiris, always served with a smile by young, good-looking bartenders.
The setting feels as authentically Cuban as they come: a chandeliered dining room on the third floor of a crumbling mansion, with original tile and mismatched antique chairs. Request a table on the new rooftop deck, which overlooks the entire old city, and order the roasted chicken. The Cuban classic is elevated with a drizzle of honey, an ingredient that’s hard to come by in this corner of the world.
Justo likes this spot—tucked down a side street in Old Havana—for its unique mix of dive bar vibes and top-quality food. You wouldn’t expect, for instance, to find citrus-flavored grilled seafood salad or rich, butter-laced chicken fricassee in a bric-a-brac space with no air conditioning. But the food is good enough to warrant regular lines out the door. Grab a table before 7 p.m., when locals start packing the place elbow-to-elbow, and cool down with frozen rum drinks and fresh fruit cocktails.
You don’t need Justo to steer you towards this Old Havana icon, but his validation is worthwhile in light of how touristy the place has become—you likely already know it was Hemingway’s bar of choice. Make the pilgrimage and you’ll find daiquiris on tap, a full rumba band, and plenty of visiting salsa fans slaying it on the dance floor.
There are three things you can expect from this Old Havana café: strong coffee, even stronger drinks, and a crowd of passionate artists with poor volume control. Make a beeline for the quieter, jungle-like outdoor dining room (covered end to end with plants and palms); all you need is an order of ham and cheese croquettes and a Cuba Libre to make itthe perfect urban oasis.
In a city not known for its fresh produce, this bilevel, brick-walled space has incredible natural juices and cocktails, all served in tall glasses with towering garnishes. Just call ahead to make sure they’ll be open; the restaurant keeps odd hours.
Justo’s restaurant in Old Havana proves that Fidel knew how to pick his staff. He makes the best paella on the island—perfectly cooked saffron rice, piled high with local seafood—and serves it in a brilliantly hued dining room overflowing with flowers and plants. Just as good is his less-formal spot next door, Al Carbón, where pork is king. The deep-fried suckling pig draws the most raves. Plus,the two restaurants have the most extensive wine lists in all of Havana. (Call a week ahead for reservations, regardless of which you choose.)
Don’t be fooled by the American name and saloon-style décor: This Old Havana restaurant is as Cuban as they come.The walls are lined with vintage photos of Havana in the 1930s, the Cuban sandwiches are filled with ultra-flavorful roast beef.Orderone of the bar’s signaturemojitos, which are made with 11-year-aged Santiago Rum.During the 1940s and 1950s, it was a magnet for American celebrities, as well as tourists wanting to mingle with them.
It’s worth noting that food shortages still exist in Cuba, and although tourism is crucial to Cuba’s economy, visitors to the island absorb a large share of the local ingredients, leaving some Cubans with little to buy. The World Food Programme (WFP) is an organization that is doing amazing work to address food-related issues in Cuba. Donate here to help offset these food shortages.",0
"Do you suffer from a constant stuffy nose or a cough that manages to keep you up every night? If this sounds like you, then you may have inflammed sinuses, also known as chronic sinusitis. You’re not alone, 32 million people also have suffer from this persistent infection, and like you I’m sure they can’t seem to figure out where it’s coming from.
Chronic sinusitis can be recognized is you feel constant pain in the forehead, upper jaw, teeth, around your cheeks, eyes, or nose. It also comes with postnasal drip, bad breath, fatigue and irritability, dizziness, and unprecedented nausea.
Antibiotics are commonly prescribed for sinus infection, but they can be the source of your chronic pain. The reason for this is that inflammed sinuses are the cause of biofilms, clumps of pathogens implicated in 80 percent of infections, and oral antibiotics are ineffective against them.
One of the most notorious and difficult to cure fungal biofilm in the body is Candida albicans. It produces a slimy coating that is difficult to penetrate. Because antibiotics can’t distinguish between good and bad bacteria in the body, it can create an environment where Candida yeast (which occurs naturally in the body) can get out of control causing harm.
Antibiotics have also been known to disrupt your body’s natural pH balance. Without proper acidity balance, your immunity is compromised, allowing things like yeasts and harmful bacteria to multiply. In fact, 1 in 3 American women have symptoms of candidiasis, or chronic yeast infection.
Along with nasal congestion and sinus pain, candidiasis also causes fatigue, indigestion, acne and skin rashes, sore and bleeding gums, thrush (white patches in the mouth or throat), and urinary or vaginal problems. Candida yeast overgrowth is common in women who use antibiotics or who have been on estrogen, have had children, and/or consume a high sugar diet.
Tips on Relieving Constant Congestion Step 1: Control Your Yeast
To destroy the yeast that is the underlying cause of chronic sinusitis, it is important to eat more protein (organic beans, free range meat, wild fish, etc.), as well as healthy fats and vegetables. Cut unhealthy sugars and high-glycemic carbs, especially grains with yeast or molds.
Fungi produce over 300 kinds of dangerous mycotoxins in foods. Grains pose the most serious risk for fungal contamination, so people with yeast infections or suspect they have one should dramatically reduce their wheat consumption and avoid harmful corn and peanuts altogether.
New research from South Korea has found that pumpkin skins contain a potent antifungal protein that fights yeast infections, including candida. The protein, known as Pr-2, also blocks fungi that attacks the plant crops.
Caprylic acid, which is found in coconut oil, is an effective antifungal for the digestive tract. It works just as well as conventional medicine in controlling yeast overgrowth, without damaging any organs, particularly your liver as the drug nystatin has been known to do. Olive leaf extract is also effective as it is a potent antimicrobial.
It’s also important to take care of our digestive tract by ensuring we take the proper amount of probiotics and prebiotics.

Step 2: Clear Out Your Sinuses
Salt is much more effective than antibiotics, and can prevent sinus problems before they even happen! Combine  a teaspoon of ground pink Himalayan salt and  teaspoon of baking soda in a cup of lukewarm water. Apply this mixture with a sterile eye dropper or by using a neti pot.
Aromatherapy oils are also very effective, especially those with antifungal properties. Use either eucalyptus, oregano, tea tree, or thyme in a room diffuser or add a few drops to your bath – the steam will help clear out your sinuses.
Keeping these two steps in mind, you’ll never have to deal with the pain and discomfort of stuffed up sinuses again!",1
"Crackling slightly down a transatlantic phone line, Audrey Luna has a pleasant, normal speaking voice. But she's only able to use it for 10 minutes.
Come Friday evening, these same vocal cords will unleash a note so dizzyingly high, so astoundingly rare, that archivists say New York's Metropolitan Opera has never heard it in 140 years - at least, not since her last performance.
And like a world-class athlete on game day, she needs to conserve her strength.
Ms Luna is a coloratura soprano - the voice type capable of the highest notes - and specialises in thrilling, trilling vocal runs that pour out strongly even at their peaks.
Few people alive have the potential to reach the note now winning her headlines - the A above high C.
To put that in context, Christmas choristers singing the descant line of Hark! The Herald Angels Sing will usually hit a high A - some with difficulty. Ms Luna's note is a full octave - or eight notes - higher than that.
The opera showcasing this rarity is Thomas Adès's The Exterminating Angel, a savage, surrealist piece based on the 1962 Luis Buuel film of the same name.
Ms Luna plays Leticia, an opera diva who joins a well-off couple for a glittering dinner party. Macabre twists unfold as the partygoers find they have entered a strange vortex - and are trapped in the house when the evening ends.
It's a supernatural note for a supernatural story - and the Oregon native is hitting it twice a night.
Beyond the usual advice for better singing technique - things like watching your posture, not smoking, and avoiding air conditioning that can dry out the throat - freakish genetics must play a part, I suggest.
""I am not a scientist!"" laughs the singer, ""but it's something I've been training for years... I've always kind of wondered what the limits are to my voice, and it wasn't until I met Tom Adès and I saw his score for The Tempest [in which she played the sprite Ariel in 2012] that I saw notes that I had never sung before.
""And when I was asked to actually do the role, I was like, 'Is that something I can do, time and time again?' I found it was easy - it came easily to me. Then, I guess he had to just write one step higher for this! He showed me on paper, saying, 'this is the approach you would take'. I said, 'what do you mean, approach?! There is no approach - it's just bang, out, sing the A!""
What does she think about when she's trying to hit that highest note?
""Well, I'm off-stage because it is an off-stage laugh... and there's a lot of people around me. It's kind of claustrophobic backstage. All the crew is there, all the singers are there because we're just about to make our first entrance. It feels like psychologically everyone's there to do their job... so it kind of takes the pressure off me, in a way. Everything goes really quickly at that moment.""
The singer was just 10 when she started voice lessons. ""I stopped violin, piano, flute, dance - I stopped all of it!"" she recalls. ""But that's the one thing I held on to, because I loved it.""
""Queen of the Night was something I was singing far too young. I was singing it behind my voice teacher's back, at the time - she didn't know I was doing it.""
The famous aria from Mozart's Magic Flute, where the Queen of the Night throws a vocally spectacular temper tantrum, is out of range for almost all sopranos as it repeatedly runs up to an F, two notes below Ms Luna's latest showpiece.
Nowadays, she is careful to protect her voice. But if I'd been hoping to hear the secrets of her brilliance, they sound disappointingly like standard self-care. On off-days, she goes on long walks or does some yoga.
""Rest is key,"" she advises. ""Seriously - it sounds silly, but sleep is the most important thing, I think, for an opera singer. And not talking too much in-between show days.
""For me in this role, it's like maxing out on the weights. If you go to the gym and lift the very most you possibly can or something - that's what singing this role is like. It's unlike any role I've ever seen - probably that's ever been written. It really does stretch the voice to its very limits.""
Any diet rules? A few, she says. ""The couple of hours before a show I'm not going to have any coffee, I'm going to stick to water. I like my ginger tea!""
New York's Metropolitan Opera is beyond the reach of many, both financially and geographically. A cinema trip may not be, though - and the Met's Live in HD series will be beaming the 18 November performance of The Exterminating Angel live into movie theatres around the world. You can find your nearest one here.
Despite the plaudits pouring in for her current vocal feat, Ms Luna is pretty sure she can go higher. ""I've sung a C above C - a couple of notes higher than the A, just in a practice room...""
Now she just needs an opera to put it in.",0
"Elon Musk is worried about governments, specifically the Russian one, competing for artificial intelligence superiorityand sparking World War III.Thatshocking statement was made all the more shocking by the low expectations the world seems to have for Russia, which U. S. Senator John McCain dismissed just a few years ago as a""gas stationmasquerading as a country.""
Recent remarks by Russian President Vladimir Putin grabbed Musk's attention. Speaking to schoolchildren about AI on Sept. 1, Putindeclared, ""Whoever becomes the leader inthis area will rule the world."" Musk's response emergedon Twitter: ""It begins...""
Actually, Russia isn't ""beginning"" anything when it comes to AI. It's just that its progress in the field has been somewhat below the radar: We are used to discussing AI in the context of major Silicon Valley companies'or top U. S. universities' advances, andwhile Russians work there, the top names are not Russian. Nor are the top thinkers and investors in the field. IBM's recent list of ""AI influencers"" only includes one native Russian speaker, University of Lousiville's Roman Yampolskiy -- who, like Musk, worries about a possible ""AI apocalypse"" -- and he's originally from Latvia, not Russia.
Russia is awful at commercializing and promotingtechnological advances. Prisma, an AI application thatliterally redrew photos to make them look like paintings by a number of famous artists, took post-Soviet countries by storm last year and won some interest in the U. S. but failed to become a global phenomenon. Other Russian AI startups are only known to experts, and while large Russian information technology companies such as Yandex and Mail.ru Group have invested a lot of resources inAI research and built products using neural networks (Yandex search, more popular than Google in Russia, is powered by proprietary neural tech), these achievements are overshadowed by those of bigger Western rivals. Even Russian venture capitalists appear to be looking for AI opportunities outside the home country.
And yet there's plenty of AI research going on in Russia. The Moscow Engineering Physics Institute's Alexei Samsonovich's is engaged in aquest for ""emotionally intelligent"" AI and the governmentis applying the technology to intitatives on electronic government and the military. Russia ranksfourth in the world, after the U. S., China and India and ahead of the U.K., in terms of the number of people who use Kaggle -- the crowdsourcing platformused by most AI researchers, which was acquired by Google this year.
The first loan the BRICS Development Bank -- a financial institution set up jointly by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- has approved for Russia is meant to fund a project that includes the use of AI in Russian courts to automate trial records using speech recognition.
State-sponsored mediareports on the potential military uses of AIhave picked up in recent months. Theyinclude an AI system to help pilots fly fighter planes, a project by St. Petersburg-based Kronstadt Group to equip drones with artificial intelligence, a similar effort for missiles by the Tactical Missiles Corporation, and a Kalashnikov combat module using neural networks. The details of these efforts are notpublic, and the agencies may be exaggerating their importance for propaganda effect. But Russia is known to be experimenting with network-centric warfare -- including during its Syrian military operation -- so AI implementations are a logical step.
It's likely that, asin Soviet times, the military applications of AI in Russia are outpacing consumer ones. With guaranteed government financing, they face fewer constraints than Russian private companies or academic researchers do, given the Silicon-Valley-centric nature of the business.
Musk is right to suggest that China is not the only potential U. S. rival in the kind of artificial intelligence that will soon do far more sinister things than those for which we use Siri. Given its number of Kaggle users, India shouldn't be too far behind. Last month'scall byMuskand agroup of AI researchers for a global ban on robotic weapons is timely but probably unworkable: The use of ostensibly conventional but actually autonomous weaponry is far more difficult to detect, making a prohibition on them harder to enforce than existing bans on chemical and biological weapons, or even than restrictions on various forms of cyberwarfare would have been. Besides, countries such as Russia, China and India will be wary of any such regulatory efforts initiated in the West.
AI is far more dangerous as part of weapons than as a potential replacement of the human brain in civilian applications. Nations will be killing with AI long before the technology can cause mass unemployment. In this sense, Musk's alarmism -- and Putin's words about AI-based global dominance -- should be taken seriously.

"Hemp is a tall, beautiful and gracious looking annual plant that can reach heights over twelve feet - and even that is more than many people know about it. Fortunately, we're here with an education to offer you.
Although hemp (cannabis sativa) and marijuana (cannabis sativa var. indica) come from a similar species of plant, they are very different and confusion has been caused by deliberate misinformation with far reaching effects on socioeconomics as well as on environmental matters.
The reason hemp is illegal is not because of any negative impact to the environment or human health, but exactly the opposite. It is so environmentally friendly, nutritionally and medicinally beneficial, that it provides too many abundant resources which would make it impossible for powerful corporations to compete.
Historical Use
Hemp is the most universally useful plant we have at our disposal. The history of mankind’s use of hemp can be traced way back in time to between about 5000 – 7000 BC. Remains of seed husks have been found at Neolithic burial sites in central Europe, which indicate that they were used in funeral rites and shamanic ceremonies. It is probable that at that time the distinctions between various strains were not as pronounced as they are today.
Up until and even during WWII, hemp was a widely grown crop, which provided the world with an excellent and most durable source of fibre. Since it is an annual with a growing cycle of only 120 days it can be harvested several times a year, depending on local weather conditions. Its biomass is considerable, which means that it absorbs large quantities of the greenhouse gas CO2.
It is resistant to bugs and requires little agrochemical treatment. It is extremely undemanding and can be grown in very poor conditions and depleted soils and will actually improve the soil structure over a period of years. For many centuries hemp was one of the most important industrial crops which provided the fibres for rope and tough, durable canvass without which the age of exploration could never have set sail.
In the US too, there have long been numerous rules and regulation in place regarding the cultivation of hemp. But unlike today’s regulations that strongly prohibit any cultivation of hemp, less than a century ago hemp cultivation was not just encouraged, but mandatory, with hefty fines being levied against farmers who refused. ‘Hemp for Victory’ was the government coined slogan that fuelled the last big bout of legal hemp cultivation during WWII, promoting hemp cultivation as a patriotic cause.
Deliberate Misinformation About THC
Hemp is a variety of cannabis sativa that has a long history of use in the United States. However, since the 1950s it has been lumped into the same category of marijuana, and thus the extremely versatile crop was doomed in the United States. Hemp is technically from the same species of plant that psychoactive marijuana comes from. However, it is from a different variety, or subspecies that contains many important differences.
Industrial hemp has very low Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels, which is the principal psychoactive constituent. Compared to marijuana which is specifically cultivated for personal psychoactive use, it is nearly impossible to “get high” on hemp. Marijuana that can be smoked usually contains between 5-10%t THC, industrial hemp contains about one-tenth of that. In order to get a psychoactive effect, one would need to smoke more than a dozen hemp cigarettes over a very short period of time to achieve any kind of psychoactive effect.
The reason for the low THC content in hemp is that most THC is formed in resin glands on the buds and flowers of the female cannabis plant. Industrial hemp is not cultivated to produce buds, and therefore lacks the primary component that forms the marijuana high. Furthermore, industrial hemp has higher concentrations of a chemical called Cannabidiol (CBD) that has a negative effect on THC and lessens its psychoactive effects when smoked in conjunction.
Industrial hemp also grows differently than THC-containing cannabis. Hemp is typically grown up, not out, because the focus is not on producing buds but on producing length of stalk. In this way, hemp is a very similar crop to bamboo. The stalk contains the fiber and hard, woody core material that can be used for a variety of purposes, even carpentry.
The two also differ in the areas that they can be effectively grown. THC-producing Marijuana must be grown in generally warm and humid environments in order to produce the desired quantity and quality of THC-containing buds. However, since industrial hemp does not contain these buds, and the hardy parts of the plant are the more desired, it can be grown in a wider range of areas.
Generally, industrial hemp grows best on fields that provide high yields for corn crops, which includes most of the Southwest, Southeast, and Northeast United States. Furthermore, since industrial hemp can use male plants as well as female plants (since the object is not THC production), higher crop yields can result.
While there is virtually no THC in the varieties grown for industrial uses such as oil and fibre, governments have cooperated with powerful corporate lobbyists the ensure that hemp is lumped into the same category as marijuana. The primary reason is that hemp has too many abundant resources for fuel, housing, food, medicine that corporations cannot exploit.
Think about how many polluting conglomerates would go down if hemp was permitted as a resource. The oil, pharmaceutical, supplement and constructions industry would need to radically shift their business model to survive.
Abundant Resources
Hemp provides the fibre to make a durable paper – a far more sensible solution than the wasteful method of clear cutting old growth forests, or even the cultivation pine plantations that are ecologically speaking dead zones that take 20 years to mature before they can be harvested. Cannabis produces 4 times more fibre per acre and can be harvested several times per year. The first dollar bills were printed on hemp paper, your old family bible is probably printed on hemp paper and even the constitution itself was drafted on hemp paper.
Hemp has the strongest natural fibres, which can be used not just to produce rough cloth, such as sails or canvass, but also durable work clothes, like the original jeans. When the plants are grown closer together the fibre becomes shorter and finer, which allows for finer textiles. Today, there are some fashion designers that are experimenting with a wide range of textiles made from hemp for their stylish, trendy hemp lines, shirts, suits, bags, jeans and more. And, no- you can’t smoke them to get high!
Hemp fibres are also finding application as a modern building material, an application that has been spearheaded and exploited successfully in France. Hemp fibres can be blended with water and limestone to create an extremely tough, light-weight, natural cement that has not only excellent insulating properties, but also shows more flexibility than conventional concrete, which makes it particularly useful as a building material in earthquake prone areas.
Back in 1941, Henry Ford built a car that was not only entirely built from ‘hemp plastic’, but also ran on hemp fuel. Hemp oil, pressed from the seeds is also extremely versatile. It can be polymerized to create a solid plastic-like material, which is extremely durable, yet nevertheless is completely natural and biodegradable, which could replace plastics in numerous industrial processes.
Car manufacturers are again turning to hemp as a resource to provide light-weight, yet shock absorbent and environmentally friendly material for their cars. Due to the high biomass hemp would also make an ideal source of ethanol, the best bio-fuel alternative to gasoline, which is capable of fuelling engines without producing all those evil gases that are destroying our atmosphere and poisoning the air. At long last, some of the top car manufacturers are beginning to follow in Ford’s steps.
Some Facts on Hemp
– Farming 6% of the continental U.S. acreage with biomass crops would provide all of America’s energy needs.
– Hemp is Earth’s number-one biomass resource; it is capable of producing 10 tons per acre in four months.
– Biomass can be converted to methane, methanol, or gasoline at a cost comparable to petroleum, and hemp is much better for the environment. Pyrolysis (charcoalizing), or biochemical composting are two methods of turning hemp into fuel.
– Hemp can produce 10 times more methanol than corn.
– Hemp fuel burns clean. Petroleum causes acid rain due to sulfur pollution.
– The use of hemp fuel does not contribute to global warming.
Hemp oil is of a very high quality and industry is using it in paints, inks and varnishes. In recent years the food industry is also discovering its virtues. Hempseed oil is one of the richest sources of essential amino acids and essential fatty acids, providing an excellent balance between omega-3, -6 and -9 fatty acids.
All of these substances are currently being discussed, not only in the alternative health scene, but also by the food industry, which is searching for suitable ingredients to create so called ‘functional foods’. Essential fatty acids are extremely important to the proper functioning of cells. They play a role in reducing bad cholesterol and plaque, which is responsible for arteriosclerosis. Healthfood companies are beginning to experiment with hemp as a basis for a large range of products- from hemp seed bars, to gummi bears, to beer, to hemp cheese and many more.
Studies have been released that show people suffering from cancer have low levels of melatonin in their bodies. Also studies have shown that just smoking hemp can raise the melatonin levels in our bodies. So one can only imagine what hemp oil that is in a concentrated state can do to increase melatonin levels. Hemp oil promotes full body healing and raises melatonin levels thousands of times higher than normal. When the pineal gland produces vast amounts of melatonin, it causes no harm to the body but it is very hard on the condition you are suffering from and indeed can eliminate it. For almost a decade, Rick Simpson has been showing people how to cure cancer with hemp oil.
Both the commercial legal type of hemp oil and the illegal THC laden hemp oil are one of the most power-packed protein sources available in the plant kingdom. Its oil can be used in many nutritional and transdermal applications.
In other chapters in my Winning the War on Cancer book we will discuss in-depth about GLA and cancer and also the interesting work of Dr. Johanna Budwig.
She uses flax seed oil instead of hemp oil to cure cancer — through effecting changes in cell walls — using these omega3 and omega6 laden medicinal oils.
Hemp Oil Uses
Every application that uses petroleum for it’s skin and hair products can use hemp oil as it is more beneficial and herbal. It can be used in many health issues as either a pain reducer or even as the cure for it.
– Since hemp oil is natural, it is used as a moisturizing oil which can be applied after a shower or a bath. When you massage your body with it, it nourishes the skin and increases the blood circulation. More on facial skin care.
– Hemp oil is used in cooking as well, though it is not suitable for high heat cooking. Along with giving a slightly nutty and crispy taste to food, it can be the perfect salad oil just in case you’re out of olive oil.
– Another application of hemp oil is it’s use as biodiesel in the same manner like other vegetable oils. It is a safe replacement for petroleum as it is non-toxic and doesn’t harm the environment.
– Almost all the forms of plastics can be made by using hemp oil instead of using petroleum as a base. As those made from petroleum, release harmful chemicals while decomposition, but those from hemp oil, don’t.
– Hemp oil can also be used in the production of paints as it doesn’t cause any armful releases when washed down from the drain and has very low emissions than the petroleum paints which are currently being used.
– Hemp oil prevents skin disorders like psoriasis, eczema, acne and dry skin. It is highly nutritious for the skin and makes a wonderful addition to homemade moisturizing blends and rejuvenating creams. (Read Andrew Weil’s article on hemp oilhttp://www.ratical.org/renewables/TherapHoil.html)
The list of beneficial uses of hemp goes on and on.
So why is non-psychoactive Hemp illegal?
There is an old saying: if you want to get to the root of a problem, follow the money. This holds true for hemp. In this case we have to ask the question ‘who benefits from hemp being illegal?’ The logical answer is: the oil companies- and their share holders, of course. Hemp became illegalized at the time when oil was beginning to make an impact on the economy as a base material for many things that hemp could also be used for, including textiles and fibres (plastics), cosmetics and fuel.
Obviously, a resource is more profitable if access to it is restricted and not every farmer can grow it himself. In an exceedingly clever PR move psychoactive marijuana and hemp have been ‘thrown in the same pot’ as it were, and a massive campaign has been launched to convince people of the dangers of marijuana alias hemp – a highly questionable assertion.
Although technically hemp is not illegal to grow in some states, it requires obtaining a special permit from the drug enforcement agency (DEA) to restrict mass production. These permits are rarely given out and require that the crop be surrounded by security measures such as fences, razor wire, security guards, or dogs. For a crop that has little-to-no potential to get people high, the current attitude is both irresponsible and draconian.
Hemp is the most useful plant ally we have – a sustainable resource par excellence, as some might like to call it. Instead of cursing it we should be grateful to its deva and use all its ample gifts to turn the ecological demise of our planet around.
It is not hard to see how immensely valuable hemp is and how it has the potential of solving many of our environmental problems, not to mention our health problems. Yet, we are continuously deprived of its benefits because farmers are prohibited from cultivating this crop.
Obviously importing it or products made from it is very expensive and the high expense is a prohibitive factor to choosing hemp as an environmentally friendly alternative even where it is available. It makes no sense to import a crop like hemp, when it can be, should be and used to be grown in all temperate and hot regions of the world.
Industrial hemp could transform the economy of the world States in a positive and beneficial way, and therefore should be exploited to its full potential.

"The number of teenagers sent to emergency rooms more than quadrupled after marijuana was legalized in Colorado — mostly for mental health symptoms, researchers reported Thursday.
They found 639 teenagers who went to one hospital system in Colorado in 2015 had either cannabis in their urine or told a doctor they’d been using cannabis. That’s up from 146 in 2005, before the use of marijuana was legalized in Colorado.
""The state-level effect of marijuana legalization on adolescent use has only begun to be evaluated,"" said the University of Colorado's Dr. George Sam Wang, who led the study.
Wang said people believe marijuana is safe — but it is not.
""The perception of risk has gone down quite a bit,"" Wang told NBC News.
""We know that marijuana use at a young age can affect adolescent brains.""
Colorado legalized medical marijuana use in 2010 and made the recreational use of marijuana legal in 2014. Other studies have shown that ER visits involving marijuana use went up after those dates, especially among children and tourists visiting Colorado.
Cannabis is legal for medical use in 28 states and Washington, D. C., and eight states plus D.C. have legalized the recreational use of marijuana and marijuana-derived products.
Wang and colleagues looked at the university hospital’s emergency department and urgent care records between 2005 and 2015 for the study, presented to a meeting of the Pediatric Academic Societies in San Francisco.
They found 3,443 ER visits by 13- to 21-year-olds to six ERs and urgent care centers over that time. Two-thirds involved psychiatric symptoms, Wang said. More than half also had evidence of other drugs in their systems as well, including alcohol, amphetamines and cocaine.
A federal survey published late last year found 6 percent of high school seniors are using marijuana daily. Wang said it’s important to find out just how harmful it is to them.
Wang has also studied the effects of legalization on younger kids, who are more likely to get hold of marijuana by accident.
In 2016 Wang found that the average rate of marijuana-related visits to the children’s hospital doubled after legalization. Poison center calls about marijuana went from nine in 2009 to 47 in 2015.
The children got the drug from parents, grandparents, neighbors, friends, babysitters or other relatives. Most of the time, the kids ate food containing marijuana. Their symptoms included drowsiness, dizziness, vomiting, agitation, dangerous heart rates and seizures.
Studies suggest that using marijuana and alcohol together impairs driving more than either substance alone and that alcohol use may increase the absorption of THC, the psychoactive chemical found in marijuana.",0
"The risk that surgery patients will become chronic opioid users may be similar after minor procedures or major operations, a U. S. study suggests.
Three to six months after surgery, new chronic opioid use was about 5.9 percent with minor operations and 6.5 percent with major surgery, the study found. The rate was just 0.4 percent in people who didn't get surgery.
A history of chronic pain appeared to be a better predictor of post-operative opioid use than the type of surgery, the study found. Compared to patients who didn't become chronic opioid users after surgery, people who did were more than 50 percent more likely to have had arthritis or chronic back pain before their operations.
""This study shows that new chronic opioid use after surgery may be one of the most common complications after surgery,"" said lead study author Dr. Chad Brummett of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
""Given that the rates of new chronic use did not differ between major and minor surgery, this suggests that patients continue to use their opioids for reasons other than the pain from the surgery,"" Brummett added by email.
Addressing patients' acute pain during their recovery from surgery may be a way to prevent them from becoming a statistic in the opioid epidemic, he suggested.
About 50 million people have surgery that doesn't require an overnight hospital stay each year. The new findings suggest that more than 2 million people may become chronic opioid users after these operations, researchers note in JAMA Surgery. Adding inpatient procedures might make the tally of post-operative chronic opioid users even higher.
For the study, researchers examined insurance claims data from 2013 to 2014 for about 36,000 adults ages 18 to 64 who had not used opioids in the previous year, at least until the month prior to surgery.
About four in five patients had minor surgical procedures for things like removing varicose veins or hemorrhoids or treating carpal tunnel syndrome. Roughly one in five had major operations like weight-loss surgery, hernia repair or hysterectomies.
Patients commonly need pain relief in the days or weeks after surgery. Researchers defined ""persistent opioid use"" as filling prescriptions for these narcotics between 90 and 180 days after surgery.
People who smoked before surgery were 34 percent more likely to become persistent opioid users after their operations, the study found. With alcohol and substance use disorders, the odds of opioid use after surgery were 34 percent higher.
The study wasn't a controlled experiment designed to prove how certain types of surgery or a history of certain habits or medical conditions might cause chronic opioid use.
Other limitations include the potential for some chronic opioid prescriptions to be for conditions or operations not included in the study, the authors note. Some surgeries might also have been misclassified as major or minor procedures.
Even so, the findings add to evidence suggesting that prolonged opioid use after surgery might not be due to pain from operations, the authors conclude.
""Smoking and substance misuse have been previously associated with use of greater dosages of opioids and opioid misuse due, in part, to shared neurobiological mechanisms,"" said Dr. Michael Hooten of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota.
""In this particular study, the findings suggest that patients with pain prior to surgery were possibly treating other non-surgical sources of pain during the postoperative period using (drugs) initially prescribed for postoperative pain,"" Hooten, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.",0
"Angkor Soul, 12 Stockport Road, Marple, Stockport SK6 6BJ (0161 222 0707). Lunch 30, dinner 60, both for two
Marple, just outside Stockport, is not the kind of town in which you would expect to find a restaurant like Angkor Soul. I suspect even its chef and founder, Y Sok, would agree. Like Seoul Kimchi a couple of weeks ago, it is the product of pure happenstance – in this case the accident of love. Indeed, think of this as a companion piece to the Seoul Kimchi review: they are both restaurants in the north of England, representing the best of their cultures in a sweetly understated way.
Y Sok is Cambodian. Her family emigrated to the US in the 1970s after the horrors of the Khmer Rouge. The food that her mother cooked was therefore far more than just dinner. It was an act of remembrance and belonging, even though getting hold of many of the ingredients was tough. It’s unsurprising that Y Sok began cooking young, first for picnics for the kids in the neighbourhood who would pay $2 a head. Later she followed her musician father around from gig to gig, selling snacks.
It also made sense that she would make a life in food, be it by leading cooking classes, as a private chef or by running supper clubs. That hasn’t stopped, though meeting her English husband, who collected vinyl records, meant moving to this leafy village at the point where Greater Manchester slips away into the Derbyshire hills. Two years ago she opened Angkor Soul, so named because in the basement there are boxes of 12in vinyls. If you share the habit, you can break off from lunch and head down in search of rare grooves.
I don’t have a record player. Obviously, therefore, my interest lies on the ground floor, an unshowy café decorated in shades of orange and red below what interior designers like to call the dado rail. A glance inside, at the convoys of three-wheeler baby buggies and the slightly harassed mothers of young children sitting beside them, and you’d clock it as the sort of place every high street needs. On the bar there are stacks of home-made flapjacks. Behind it there is a hissing coffee machine.
What matters is the vivid, extremely fresh Cambodian home cooking. I visit on a lunchtime when the menu is short and concise, but it’s all there. Y Sok herself says the repertoire is heavily influenced by that of neighbours Thailand and Vietnam, with a bit of French colonialism thrown in for good measure. Having never been anywhere near any of them I won’t argue. We start with plump, almost squared-off summer rolls, the translucent rice paper skins wrapped around bulky king prawns, with minced pork, rice noodles and vegetables, alongside a sweet-sour dipping sauce. These are soft pockets of loveliness which make you feel virtuous and clever for having decided to order them.
Crisp-shelled chicken wings, under a powerful, chilli-spiked sweet-savoury glaze, are a six-napkin job that have you nibbling down to the very end of the wing tip. A cabbage salad is a victory of shredding. In among the rice noodles and the carrots, the house-roasted peanuts and the crispy shallots, the cooling ballast of cucumber and the heavy waft of fresh mint, there is an invigorating hit of sweet and sour. At 6.95 it is the most expensive starter.
This being lunch time, there is a list of sandwiches which, in the Vietnamese style, are enclosed in baguettes. These become less bread than vehicles for flavour bombs. Thinly sliced steak has been marinated in a powerful lemongrass paste before being seared, then stacked inside with a chilli mayo, pickled carrots and a few other things besides. It’s the sort of sandwich you want the makings for at home, on standby for emergencies, because it will make most things better.
An order of Cambodian mee noodles brings one of those spiced broths you could get lost in. There is tamarind for the sour end of the spectrum, alongside fresh lime leaves and a rust-coloured liquor that hits you in the sinuses. Ours comes with chicken but, like everything else here, they’ll make it with beef, chicken, prawns or without meat of any kind. (Indeed, on Sundays the place has an increasingly popular vegan menu). A Cambodian kari, in our case made with beef, closely resembles a Thai massaman. The sweet, coconut-based sauce is thick and powerful; the sticky steamed rice becomes a necessary soothing presence. I mean all this admiringly.
The evening menu is longer, but not by much. I like the sound of Cambodian fried chicken, and of the coconut tamarind mussels and I’m a sucker for a proper rendang. Prices rise a little in the evening with main courses in the low teens, but given they come fully accessorised the bill will always stay low. Dessert is not a major concern, or a concern at all, but that’s OK because they have their squidgy flapjack. It does the job. All this, and a stack of old records in the basement. The restaurant lives up to its name. It has soul.
Which is all you need to know about this little diamond in Marple, so let me use my remaining words for a vaguely connected confession. Occasionally I am asked to name my guilty food pleasure and I reply that I have none. Because if I start feeling guilty about food, where do I stop? But I’ve realised that I do have one restaurant habit which is embarrassing, so I’ve decided to get it out there.
Not far from where I live in Brixton is the original Mamalan’s, a small café doing Beijing street food (there are others in Clapham, Shoreditch and Dalston). I sneak in there from time to time by myself. And I always have exactly the same thing. I don’t even look at the menu. Which, as I say, is embarrassing. I should be brave. I should be curious. Instead I’m a lousy creature of habit.
It’s always the grilled pork dumplings, that leak stock with each bite, alongside a few pickles. And then the crispy chicken wings, which seem to have Sichuan peppercorns in the batter, and which make my lips tingle and my heart sing. Plus a little bowl of chilli oil for dipping. That’s lunch done for 11, or 12.50 with a tip. God, it’s good. Is it OK if I carry on eating the same thing? It is? Thank you.
Angkor Soul is one of only two Cambodian restaurants in the UK. For the record the other one is Lemongrass in London’s Camden Town. I haven’t been, but it’s been well reviewed by people I trust. The menu includes leek cake with dipping sauces, spring chilli chicken and king prawns in a pepper and tamarind sauce with palm sugar (lemongrass-restaurant.co.uk).
Restaurant reviews do go out of date, but few so quickly as my very positive review last month of The Straight and Narrow in Limehouse. I have been contacted by the chef, Dave Cousin, who tells me a disagreement with the management over the direction of the food means the key kitchen personnel are leaving. That review is therefore now out of date. I wish both restaurant and brigade well.
Want to make money in restaurants? Stop chasing the youth pound, because they’re skint. According to research from the NPD Group the growth area is lunch for the over 50s, with visits up 6% compared to 2008, and spend is up 12%.

When you buy a pair of new shoes, a handbag or dried seaweed, you probably notice the small silica gel packets in them that are labeled ‘DO NOT EAT’. Most of us throw them out because we think that they have no use after the shoes have been removed from the box. However, when you read the numerous uses of these tiny bags filled with silica gel, you will definitely stop throwing them away and solve a lot of everyday problems.
The Different Uses of Silica Gel Bags
Prevents spices from clumping up
Kitchens are the most humid areas of the home and this is not good for powdery ingredients like spices, but sugar as well, because it causes them to clump up. However, you can still keep your spices in your kitchen cabinets without fearing moisture. Just tape a silica bag to the spice bottle because the silica will absorb the surplus moisture and keep your spices fresh.
Dry out your mobile phone
If you accidentally dropped your phone in water, you should take out the battery and memory cards and then place the phone in a bowl filled with silica gel packages. Before powering the phone, leave it in the bags for one night.
Keep your documents safe
To prevent damage onto documents like birth and marriage certificates, social security cards, etc. put few silica gel bags in the envelope or box where you keep the documents.
Protect Halloween decorations
To prolong the quality and longevity of Halloween decorations, put a silica bag or two inside the bag or box where you keep them.
Dry clothes while on the go
If you do not have enough time to wait until your towels or bathing suits are dry, pack them with several silica bags to soak up the surplus moisture.
Prolong the duration of razors
Since storing razor in open air causes oxidation and premature dulling, you should put them in a jar with silica bags that will absorb the surplus water from the razor.
Refresh gym bags
Always keep a couple of silica packages in your gym bag to refresh it. Namely, the silica will absorb moisture and reduce the chance of bacteria and unpleasant odor.
Prevent the camera from condensation
Taking photos outdoors when the weather is cold can cause condensation of the lens or camera when you bring it into a warmer area. To solve this, remove the battery, memory card, and the lens (if it’s applicable) and put the camera in a container of several silica bags that will absorb moisture.
Make bulk pet food last longer
Tape a package of silica gel onto the bag’s edge.
Prevent tarnishing of jewelry
Unfortunately, humidity can cause the jewelry to tarnish. To avoid this, put few silica gel bags in your jewelry box.
Prevent seeds from molding
If you keep seeds for next year’s planting, you should divide different seeds in smaller envelopes and keep them in an airtight container with several silica gel packages.
Speed up the drying of flowers
A lot of people use dried flowers for decorative purposes; however, the process of drying can be too long and in a lot of cases, the flowers die before they actually dry completely. But, you can speed up the drying if you put the flowers in a plastic bag with a couple of silica gel bags.
Prevent condensation on windows
Place few silica bags onto the sills in order for them to absorb the surplus moisture. This goes for windshields as well.

"Sergio Canavero’s plans to carry out the world’s firsthead transplant surgery sounds more like a science-fiction novel each time it makes the news.
The media-savvy neurosurgeon has recently revealed that his teamwill use virtual reality (VR) to help the patient transition to their “new world” after the surgery.
Dr Canavero hopestopull off this head transplant procedure by the end of 2017, in a project known as HEAVEN (Head Anastomosis Venture). His team aim to attach the severed head of a live man to thebody of brain-dead donor during a 36-hour surgical operation thatwill involvethe complex re-connection of a severed spinal cord and jugular vein.
Critics of the project (of which there are a fair few) say the procedure could cause unknowable amounts of emotional distress and deep psychological confusion to the patient. One doctor even said the patient could suffer a fate “worse than death”.
Asa reply to this criticism, the HEAVEN project will turn to virtual reality to help the patient transition to his new full-bodied world, Canavero announced during a conference at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow on Friday.
The VR system has been developed by the healthcare tech company Inventum Bioengineering Technologies. Using a physical hoist to hold the patient upright, it will create an immersive experience to simulate the sensation of walking and the voluntary use of motor functions, as well as prepare the patient for the distress of seeing them-self on someone else’s body. The patient will be trained using the VR system for months before the operation.
“This virtual reality system prepares the patient in the best possible way for a new world that he will be facing with his new body,”Canavero said. “A world in which he will be able to walk again.”
Canavero’s team hope to pull off the groundbreaking experiment on Valery Spiridonov, a 30-year-old Russian man with muscular atrophy.
Speaking about the use of VR, Spiridonov said: “Virtual reality simulations are extremely important as this kind of system allows [the patient] to get involved into action and learn fast and efficiently. As a computer scientist, I am extremely certain that it is an essential technology for the HEAVEN project.”
Canavero also dropped another bombshell at the conference by saying he hopes to conduct the operation in the UK. As with much of the project, that claim is shrouded withskepticism and uncertainty. Nevertheless, the doctor is as confident as ever.
“Why? Because I had so much good feedback from Britain, from surgeons, that I do believe that it could get real traction if we push it hard here, so it is time for you here in Britain to start discussing all the ethical implications and if you are willing to see this happen here, because if the UK says no then it will be somewhere else,” headded. “But in Europe the UK really looks like the most promising place.”",1
"News 8 – Your remote car key isn’t a key. It’s billions of them. It doesn’t have just one secret code to your car. That would be too easy for someone to electronically intercept, copy and use. Instead, your car key uses what’s known as a “rolling code.” Every time you press the button, a new, randomly generated code is sent over a radio frequency to your car, which has a secret eyes code generator recognizes it and then burns it so it can never be used again. The key and the car then create new codes for the next time around, and the process repeats.
In case the two ends get out of sync – say your kids grabbed the keys when they’re out of range and press the button a bunch of times – the car can recognize a few hundred future codes. When it receives one of them, it disables all prior ones. It’s a proven system that secured tens of millions of cars and remote garage door openers for years. And now it may be useless.
A white hat hacker Samy Kamkar, who last week cracked GM’s OnStar smart phone apps security and demonstrated his ability to illicitly unlock and start a car over a cellular network, has developed a device made from $20 worth of parts that he calls the RoleJam, which does exactly what its name implies.Kamkar tells FOXNews.com that when someone tries to use a remote key, the device copies the code and jams the signal so the car doesn’t receive it. When the user clicks his remote again, the device sends through the original code as it captures the new one, giving the attacker a valid code to use as he pleases.
The RollJam It is small, not much larger than the remotes it emulates, and can likely be further miniaturized. The only caveat is that it needs to be within range of the key’s transmission to work, but that is often more than 50 feet. It needs to be programmed for the specific security system it’s attacking, but many brands use the same suppliers and Kamkar has tried it out successfully on several. He admits there may be newer verification protocols out there that he can’t beat, but he’s yet to encounter one, and that still leaves older cars and garage doors vulnerable.
Kamkar will reveal more technical details on RollJam and his OnStar exploit on Friday at the Def Con 23 Hacker Conference in Las Vegas. The conference will also feature a car hacking village, where you can find out all the other ways your car is insecure.",1
"One of the central tenets of our country was that it was founded on religious freedom. Our founders knew that it was important for the government to stay out of people’s private lives. During the time America was founded our founding fathers had witnessed the dangers of having a set religion. For over a hundred years, Europe was being torn apart by a series of wars over which Christian denomination should preside over them all. One of the main complaints was that the Catholic church had way too much power over the government.
So, when our country was founded, they wanted to keep religious preference out of government decisions. For years, people from all walks of life and religion have flocked to America for that very freedom. The freedom to worship freely without government interference. However, that very freedom is now under attack from the influx of Muslim refugees entering the country. These Muslims claim they desire a better life free from oppression, but that is not the case. Over the past few years, Muslims have been slowly implementing Sharia Law without hardly any pushback.
The reason why that has been allowed is that Americans fear that they will be called a bigot, a racist, or Islamaphobic. And, because of that fear, Sharia Law has slowly been creeping across the country, and into our public schools. For example, a Detroit-area high school is hosting what they are calling a Princess Prom. Now, this may sound innocent and hardly frightening, but there is always more than meets the eye.
In 2012, five female high school students started the Princess Prom for girls that could not attend a traditional prom due to cultural and religious reasons. What makes this prom so special is that no males are allowed to attend whatsoever. This special prom allows the female students to to dress and dance freely among other women.
“The event was intended to create a safe space for Muslim girls who normally have to cover up in hijab let their hair down in an environment with no boys and no phones.”
Here is more from Michigan Live:
Five Muslim girls from Hamtramck High School started “Princess Prom” in 2012 to give girls the opportunity to dress up as they please and dance the night away.
Last year, 230 girls showed up to the dance at the PNA Banquet Hall in Hamtramck. This year, the team expects about 250 in attendance.
The event is intended to create a safe space for Muslim girls who normally cover up in hijab to let their hair down in an environment with no boys and no cellphones.
Phones are banned to prevent problems with photos being posted to social media.
“We’re on our phones 24-7 and if you don’t have it for a few hours, it’s so calming and everybody is having a fun time,” said Aisha Khanum, an 18-year-old student at Hamtramck High School who has been on Princess Prom planning committee for three years.
The dance offers a separate zone for anyone who needs to use their phone.
Like any other prom, the girls show up in extravagant gowns, shiny stilettos and flashy makeup and hair styles, and they are surrounded with food and lively music.
This one adds an extra cultural element with henna tattoos, a popular form of body art in parts of the Middle Eastern, North African and South Asia.
Really? This is what is happening in our public schools now? This is how I am beginning to look at this issue, and I hope you hear me out. We know what the threat is and we all know that we need to do to stop it, but when will we? It is one thing for us to post on social media and share these stories, but what are we doing to end it once and for all?
The fact of the matter is we need to be protesting these events and what is happening schools in a physical form. We cannot hope that elected officials will be the ones to stop this invasion. Until we show them we do not want this to happen it will continue, and I am not ready to let these leftist lunatics win.
These are our public schools that are paid for with our hard-earned money. We most certainly have a right to say what is going on behind those walls. Maybe if more of us protested and spoke up at school board meetings, we may make some headway, and make a real change.

Just one can of the popular stimulant energy drink Red Bull can increase your risk of heart attack or stroke. The effect was seen even in young people.
The caffeine-loaded beverage causes blood to become sticky, a pre-cursor to cardiovascular problems such as stroke. One hour after drinking Red Bull, your blood system becomes abnormal, as might be expected from a patient with cardiovascular disease.
Red Bull is banned in Norway, Uruguay, and Denmark because of health risks. Energy drinks have been popping up all over supermarket and convenience store shelves in recent years, and have overtaken bottled water as the fastest-growing category in the beverage business.
No less than 3.5 billion cans of Red Bull were sold last year in 143 countries. Yet questions regarding the safety of Red Bull, as well as other energy drinks, keep cropping up at regular intervals when yet another overzealous energy-addict keels over.
Do Energy Drinks Really Live Up to Their Name?
When you break down the contents of one of those eight-ounce cans, the primary ingredients are caffeine and sugar (in the form of glucuronolactone, sucrose, and glucose). So the answer is yes, energy drinks will provide you with a quick burst of energy.
However, this is not a lasting effect, and drinking several in a row will not turn you into a flying superhero, no matter how hard their sinister marketing geniuses try to convince you otherwise.
According to the official website, Red Bull’s benefits include:
Improved performance
Increased concentration and reaction speed
Increased endurance
Increased metabolism
However, the effects of this energy drink will be similar to that of drinking a cup of coffee or a can of soda, in that when the effect wears off, you’ll start feeling lethargic and will likely crave another can (or cup) to boost your energy once again.
As many of you likely know, it can become a vicious cycle.
According to the article above, the Austria-based company that created Red Bull warns consumers not to drink more than two a day of their wings-in-a-can, but I couldn’t find any references to that fact on Red Bull’s website. Only a statement that said you should compare your consumption to that of coffee, with one can of Red Bull equaling one cup of brewed java.
The problem with that recommendation is the fact that no one really knows the net effect of chugging Red Bull like you would coffee. Coffee has caffeine, yes, but it doesn’t contain all those other artificial and energy-boosting ingredients, including no less than TWO artificial sweeteners (in addition to all the other sugar).
Aspartame alone has been shown to have multiple neurotoxic, metabolic, allergenic, fetal, and carcinogenic effects. I don’t believe it is safe for anyone to drink and I wrote an entire book about it called Sweet Deception.
Do Energy Drinks Have Health Benefits?
Nutritionally speaking, energy drinks are comparable to carbonated beverages like soda in that they offer little of value to your body. Yes, there are traces of B vitamins in Red Bull, and it contains the amino acid taurine, but this cannot make up for the detrimental effects of caffeine and sugar.
Although caffeine can certainly increase short-term reaction speed, one major problem is that no one really knows how the combination of ingredients in Red Bull will affect your body. This is especially concerning since energy drinks are marketed toward people under the age of 30, and are especially popular among students and night clubbers who often drink several cans at a time.
Who Should Definitely Avoid Energy Drinks?
It is fairly self-evident that children should never consume these kinds of drinks, but due to the detrimental health impact of their contents, it would definitely be wise to avoid energy drinks if you:
Are pregnant or lactating
Are sensitive to caffeine
Suffer from anxiety
Suffer from high stress
Suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome
Have high blood pressure
Are predisposed to cardiovascular disease
Have any kind of blood clotting disorder
As lead researcher Scott Willoughby stated, Red Bull can be deadly when combined with stress or high blood pressure, as it can impair proper blood vessel function and raise your risk of blood clots.
Mix With Alcohol for a Potentially Deadly High
Mixing energy drinks with alcohol, which is combining a stimulant with a depressant, has become an increasingly popular occurrence at bars. When mixed with alcohol, drinks like Red Bull are instantly morphed into popular club drinks like “Vodka Bulls” and “Yager Bombs.”
The combined effect of these substances is unknown, but researchers say overloading your body with heavy stimulants and heavy depressants could lead to heart failure, and according to previous news stories about fatal outcomes from this deadly mixture, that’s not just a theory.
Countries like France and Denmark banned sales of Red Bull following several reported deaths of people who mixed it with alcohol.
The Red Bull brand has even made it into the scientific literature. The journal Medicine, Science, and Law published an article in 2001 on the effects of alcohol and Red Bull combined with yet another stimulant: ephedra.
The result? Acute psychosis.
And in this month’s issue of the Journal of the Clinical Autonomic Research Society, an Italian case study reviewed an incident of “postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) associated with a vasovagal reaction,” recorded in a young volleyball player after an excess intake of Red Bull.
They concluded:
“Considering the widespread use of Red Bull among young people who are often unaware of the drink’s drug content, this case report suggests Red Bull be considered a possible cause of orthostatic intolerance.”
Orthostatic intolerance is a condition in which change from the supine position (laying down) to an upright position causes an abnormally large increase in heart rate (more than a 30 beats per minute increase, or a heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute within 10 minutes of sitting or standing up).
POTS has also been proposed as a mechanism for symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome, so if you’re suffering from chronic fatigue, drinking energy drinks is likely NOT in your best interest, which is why I included it in the list above.
As for alcohol, I don’t recommend drinking it at all. It is well established that alcohol is a neurotoxin, which means it can poison your brain. You also need to be aware that consuming large amounts of alcohol — even wine — will increase your insulin levels, thereby accelerating your risk of diabetes and other chronic diseases.
How to Increase Your Energy Without Energy Drinks
If you’re drinking energy drinks for the reason most people do — to get more energy – know that there are far superior options than artificial energy drinks. Humans are not naturally sluggish or constantly tired. This lethargic state is something that many of us have brought on ourselves.
Your lack of energy is likely due to a combination of factors including:
Poor food choices
Low-quality food
Stressful lifestyle
Negative emotions
Lack of sleep
Lack of exercise
Increasing your energy levels, then, is as easy as remedying these factors by:
Eating right for your nutritional type
Increasing your intake of omega-3 fats
Eliminating grains and sugars from your diet
Releasing emotional stress and negativity with the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)
Sleeping when you’re tired
Exercising

Using a pressure cooker can sound really intimidating if you've never tried it. But believe me when I tell you once you make your first meal in an Instant Pot, you'll never want to stop.
The Instant Pot DUO60 7-in-1 is the best-selling pressure cooker on Amazon and for good reason. It's easy to use and doesn't go overboard with techy bells and whistles, but still gives you lots of ways to customize how you cook. And right now, it's $15 off the regular $99.95 price.
There are others that are more affordable, but they lack the preset cooking options and fine-tuning abilities, and others with more features, but learning to use them properly can be annoying and stressful. The DUO60 7-in-1 is the perfect balance.
When I first got my Instant Pot DUO60 7-in-1, I was really wary of figuring out a machine so foreign to me. I didn't have one growing up, and none of my relatives or my friends' families did either. I thought I'd try it once and go back to my pots and pans...
But, it was a gift, and I wanted to see why it was so popular, so I found a few recipes I thought sounded tasty (and easy) and tried them out. I expected the result to be underwhelming (and undercooked), but I was able to make a full meal in no time, didn't have to spend the whole time hovering over the stove, and only had one pot to toss in the dishwasher when I was done. I was in love—no, I was obsessed.
With the $15 you'll save, I highly recommend investing in a tempered glass lid ($14.99) made to fit your new Instant Pot. It's a lot easier to use than the pressure lid when you're keeping your meal warm so you can have a second helping, and it's great for simmering soups and stews.

"When Microsoft last updated Windows 10 in the spring, the company said its vision was “to empower the creator in all of us.” Microsoft is sticking with that mantra and approach with the release of the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update that started rolling out this week.
While largely continuing on the same path, this latest update includes a collection of modest but welcome improvements, from pushing ahead with 3D to bolstering security.
Windows, of course, no longer just applies to the venerable operating system at the core of your personal computer. These days, Microsoft says, Windows 10 is running on more than 500 million devices each month, and the Windows experience is meant to extend well beyond your traditional PC experiences.
For example, this latest version of Windows coincides with the simultaneous release of “mixed reality” virtual reality headsets from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and soon Samsung. Such headsets start around $300.
Windows 10 is relevant to the Xbox One crowd as well.
Not lost here is the fact that having Windows 10 also makes nice with iPhone or Android handsets, which only underscores the recent confirmation from a top Microsoft executive that its own Windows Phone hardware is dead.
Of course, Microsoft is by no means giving up on PC hardware, and along with the new Windows, Microsoft has just unveiled the upcoming Surface Book 2 laptop, a powerful and pricey computer the company hopes will appeal to the same people who might otherwise choose a MacBook Pro from Apple.
Microsoft executive Panos Panay claims 17 hours of battery life for this handsome new 4-pound laptop with a detachable screen. “Creators need battery life,” he proclaims.
They’ll also need a big budget. Surface Book 2 starts at $1,499 for a 13-inch model and carries a whopping $2,499 starting price for the 15-inch version. While the machine looks impressive, I haven’t been able to test one. But the well-heeled creators Panos has in mind for Surface Book 2 are professional photographers, data scientists, engineers pushing the boundaries of machine learning, developers, and yes hardcore gamers.
In the meantime, I’ve been running the latest version of Windows 10 on a Surface Pro computer. Here’s some of what you can expect:
During its last Windows 10 update, Microsoft brought the ability to create and modify 3D objects to its venerable Paint photo-manipulation program.3D is now part of Office, which means you can create3D objects for use in PowerPoint presentations, Word and Excel. Inside PowerPoint, you cantap on a ""morph"" transition to move your3D model from one slide to the next, which if you're skillful can make for anice effect.
I had a bit of fun inside aMixed Reality viewer whereI was able to turn on the computer’s camera and place a 3D chicken on top of a real-world view.
Do you tend to call on the same people all the time, notably your spouse, your kids, your boss? You can pin these folks to your taskbar, and better still share pictures and other files with them just by dragging them onto the pinned contact. And you can easily call, email or Skype someone from the taskbar.
Microsoft also wants you to be more creative inside the photos app or have the app do it for you. You can automatically generate a short movie based on your videos or stills, choosing to edit it yourself after the fact. Using a Surface pen, you can draw on pictures too. Eventually you'll be able to add 3D objects and animations. Not yet.
Through almost every new version of Windows that I can remember, you hear about features that are supposedto safeguard your system (and I can hear the skeptics out there reminding us thatthrough the years such measures were not always foolproof). This time around Microsoft says it can better protect you against WannaCry and other ransomware, where an attacker takes over your computer and demands a ransom beforegiving you back control. I certainly hope that's the case.
Another new feature will let you recover and reset your PIN and password right from the lock screen, useful, obviously, if you forget it.
You’ve been able to mark-up and doodle on documents, photos and web pages for a while, taking advantage of the inking features inside Windows with a Surface pen. You can now annotate eBooks, or use the pen as a PowerPoint clicker (via Bluetooth) And if you tend to misplace that pen, you now have a chance of finding it through a feature that tracks its last known location.
Microsoft has added a potentially helpful currency converter to the calculator in Windows.
If you use OneNote for note-taking, you can access files on-demand from the cloud when you need them, without consuming disk space.
And through an accessibility feature for people who are unable to control a keyboard and mouse, Microsoft has added the ability to control Windows with just your eyes, using a compatible eye tracker.
To update to Windows, you'll need a computer with a 1GHz processor or faster, at least 1GB or RAM and 16 GB of drive space for a 32-bit system or 2GB for 64-bit, and 20 GB of drive space.
If you don’t want to wait for the update to roll out automatically, you can manually get the Fall Creators Update via the Update Assistant on Microsoft’s software download site",0
"The Houston Texans have publicly displayed their idiocy. These bros are about as bright as a sack of wet mice. Check it out.
Although that phrase is probably racist somehow.
Who the hell knows at this point.
Most of the team took a knee on Sunday, and well, it just made it completely clear that these bros don’t know how to use the Google machine.
Doug had covered this nonsense here:
These wannabe Mensa members are just dumb.
Actually, looks like there’s almost a whole NFL team full of them.
Clay Travis of OutKick the Coverage handled it pretty well.
He said that theTexans are just showing how unbelievably dumb they are to not get a well-understood use of thelanguage.
Let me us a simile to illustrate: These protesting Texans players are as dumb as a box of rocks.
A metaphor would be: The protesting Texans players are dumber than a box of rocks.
Texans — the real ones — have a reputation: they’re badass, salt of the Earth, and fiercely independent. They’re smart as a whip and they stand up for what’s right.  They love their God, their guns, and their country.  They are, after all, Texans.
They’re not wimpy little virtue signaling leftists looking under every rock for something to be outraged about.
These wussified, kneeling clowns are unworthy of the name ‘Texans’.
Either they need to change and live up to that name, or get turfed.
The players, even if they weren’t ‘edumacated’ in idioms and metaphors, could have just ‘Googled’ it. You know, to see if they should be outraged or not.Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL) had to look up the meaning of the ’empty barrel’ comment by Gen. Kelly before deciding it was racist and she should be outraged.
An idiom, for those of you who need a refresher course in elementary school English, is per the dictionary “a group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of the individual word.”
The easiest possible example? When someone says “it’s raining cats and dogs,” it is not literally raining cats and dogs. It’s just raining hard.
If you had never heard the idiom McNair used you could have pulled out your phone and googled the phrase, rapidly understanding its common usage. That way your response wouldn’t be ignorant, illogical and prove the exact point the owner of your team was making — that protests are bad for business.
But did any of these geniuses do that?
And guess what? It couldn’t just stop at kneeling, could it?
Ten of them didn’t bother to show up for work.
Seriously. They didn’t go to their JOB.
Frankly, it’s a darn good thing that Bob McNair didn’t use a different idiom or he’d be in in even bigger trouble.
The Houston Texans owner should actually be thanking his lucky stars he didn’t say “we can’t let the monkeys run the zoo,” because if he’d said that he would have been led before a firing squad and publicly executed immediately before the national anthem in Seattle. IDIOMS ARE HATE CRIMES, Y’ALL!
It’s impossible for the country to get any dumber.
Until next week, that is, when the Houston Texans will probably take a knee to protest the pot calling the kettle black, which is a clear example of culinary racism.
You know they’d do that.
Travis sums up his article with a slew of idioms.
Apologies to Colin Kaepernick, I didn’t think it was possible for players to protest in a dumber way than you did, but I was wrong. The Houston Texans idiotic idiom protest takes the cake.
On Sunday the Houston Texans players executed the dumbest protest in sports history by barking up the wrong tree. They need to go back to the drawing board before they add even more insult to injury. Because unless they want to give up their day jobs they are crying over spilt milk by jumping on the protest bandwagon.
And over at that craphole, ESPN, Charles Woodson refuses to say ‘Owner’ of the team, because that’s reminiscent of the ‘plantation mentality’ of the NFL or something.
Are these people serious?
Bob McNair is the one that cuts the cheques. Without him, they wouldn’t be working. Heowns the team — the business — that employs these NFL players.
He doesn’t ‘own’ the players, but he owns the brand.
And just like any business, he should be allowed to dictate what his employees may and may not do while they are on the job.
Is this so freaking difficult?
No wonder football players are viewed as dumb. It’s crap like this that makes them look like complete and utter morons.
A shirt that aptly describes the NFL — No Fans Left.
Buy it now at the ClashDaily Store.
NFL’s TV ratings are plummeting as more players refuse to stand for the national anthem. It’s hard to believe that a nation that has given these players the opportunity to achieve so much is so easily disrespected. Even worse, consider the men and women who have laid down their lives so that these athletes could live in a relatively safe country and enjoy their fame and fortune.
Hard-working, patriotic Americans don’t want to watch a bunch of whiners play football. They want to watch winners.
And the best part? This shirt is made in the USA, printed in the USA, on an American-Made t-shirt press!
Grab this to read on your newfound downtime.
Does your grandpa go off on paltry politicians, whether they be Democrats or Republicans? Does he get misty eyed when he talks about God and Country and America’s future? And have you ever heard him scream, ‘Awww … Hell no!’ when Rosie O’Donnell starts yapping on television? If you answered yes to one, or all of the above, then your gramps will love Doug Giles’ latest book, My Grandpa Is A Patriotic Badass.
Don’t be fooled by the title — this ain’t just for Grandpa.
The Snowflake Generation — and the rest of America — needs a good ol’ dose of ‘Grandpa wisdom’.
Especiallyif that Grandpa is Doug Giles.
You’ll love My Grandpa Is A Patriotic Badass just as much as Grandpa will.

Allow Windows to install the appropriate in box drivers.
If upgrading from a previous Bloomberg keyboard, restart the Bloomberg application.
What are the USB cable length limitations for the Bloomberg keyboard 4 (Starboard)?
The USB specification limits the length of a cable between USB 2.0 devices to 5 meters (or about 16 feet). In order to go beyond these limits our clients will need to use self-powered USB hubs, self-powered USB active extension cables or self-powered USB over Ethernet products that meet the requirements as advised on Bloomberg keyboard 4 (Starboard).
There is no sound coming from my Bloomberg keyboard. How can I troubleshoot?
To see if the Bloomberg keyboard 3 (Freeboard\Seaboard) is selected as your default sound playback device, please follow these instructions:
Unplug the Bloomberg keyboard and plug it into a different USB port if available.
Click on the Playback tab, and click on the “Bloomberg keyboard Audio” speakers icon.
Select “Set Default”, and a green tick should appear beside “Bloomberg keyboard Audio” and set as Default Device. Click on Apply, then OK.
If you continue to experience issues, please contact our 24×7 Global Customer Support.
If the Bloomberg keyboard 4 (Starboard) is selected as your default sound playback device, please follow these instructions:
Confirm in Windows that the sound playback device is set to Starboard.
Unplug the Bloomberg keyboard and plug it into a different USB port if available.
Click into the Playback tab, and click on the “USB audio” speakers icon.
Ensure the volume is turned up (not muted).
Test with applications other than Bloomberg: i.e., video playback on a website (YouTube, CNN.com, etc.)
Try to re-seat the USB cable.
If you continue to experience issues, please contact our 24×7 Global Customer Support.
Note: Because the Bloomberg keyboard 4 (Starboard) is a plug and play device with no stand-alone drivers, the playback device in windows will show as “USB Audio” and not specifically defined as a Bloomberg keyboard. If there are multiple USB sound playback devices connected, one would need to browse the list carefully and ensure the Starboard keyboard is selected.

"Although it seemsincreasingly unlikely he acted alone, Las Vegas Mandalay Bay massacre shooter Stephen Paddock is now known to have been taking prescription psychiatric medicationsthat have been repeatedly linked to mass shootings. As detailed onPsychDrugShooters.com, over 100 mass shooting events have been carried out by people who are taking psychiatric medications.
“Stephen Paddock, who killed at least58 people and wounded hundreds morein Las Vegas on Sunday with high-powered rifles, was prescribed an anti-anxiety drug in June that can lead to aggressive behavior,” reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal:
Records from the Nevada Prescription Monitoring Program obtained Tuesday show Paddock was prescribed 50 10-milligram diazepam tablets by Henderson physician Dr. Steven Winkler on June 21.
Diazepam is a known to promote violent behavior and psychotic episodes. Via the Las Vegas Review-Journal:
“If somebody has an underlying aggression problem and you sedate them with that drug, they can become aggressive,” said Dr. Mel Pohl, chief medical officer of the Las Vegas Recovery Center. “It can disinhibit an underlying emotional state. … It is much like what happens when you give alcohol to some people … they become aggressive instead of going to sleep.”
Pohl, who spoke to the Review-Journal from the Netherlands, said the effects of the drug also can be magnified by alcohol.
A 2015 study published in World Psychiatry of 960 Finnish adults and teens convicted of homicide showed that their odds of killing were 45 percent higher during time periods when they were on benzodiazepines.
Recent shootings in the news – Sandy Hook, The Batman Movie Shooting, Columbine, and others all have a common denominator : Prescription drugs were all in their systems at the times these crimes were committed.
Almost every mass shooting over the last 20 years involved a shooter taking psychiatric drugs
Here’s a partial list, published by Natural News, of just a few of the mass shootings that have been carried out by people taking psychiatric drugs:
 Eric Harris age 17 (first on Zoloft then Luvox) and Dylan Klebold aged 18 (Columbine school shooting in Littleton, Colorado), killed 12 students and 1 teacher, and wounded 23 others, before killing themselves. Klebold’s medical records have never been made available to the public.
 Jeff Weise, age 16, had been prescribed 60 mg/day of Prozac (three times the average starting dose for adults!) when he shot his grandfather, his grandfather’s girlfriend and many fellow students at Red Lake, Minnesota. He then shot himself. 10 dead, 12 wounded.
 Cory Baadsgaard, age 16, Wahluke (Washington state) High School, was on Paxil (which caused him to have hallucinations) when he took a rifle to his high school and held 23 classmates hostage. He has no memory of the event.
 Christopher Pittman, age 12, murdered both his grandparents while taking Zoloft.
 Mathew Miller, age 13, hung himself in his bedroom closet after taking Zoloft for 6 days.
 Kip Kinkel, age 15, (on Prozac and Ritalin) shot his parents while they slept then went to school and opened fire killing 2 classmates and injuring 22 shortly after beginning Prozac treatment.
 Luke Woodham, age 16 (Prozac) killed his mother and then killed two students, wounding six others.
 A boy in Pocatello, ID (Zoloft) in 1998 had a Zoloft-induced seizure that caused an armed stand off at his school.
 Michael Carneal (Ritalin), age 14, opened fire on students at a high school prayer meeting in West Paducah, Kentucky. Three teenagers were killed, five others were wounded..
 A young man in Huntsville, Alabama (Ritalin) went psychotic chopping up his parents with an ax and also killing one sibling and almost murdering another.
 Andrew Golden, age 11, (Ritalin) and Mitchell Johnson, aged 14, (Ritalin) shot 15 people, killing four students, one teacher, and wounding 10 others.
 TJ Solomon, age 15, (Ritalin) high school student in Conyers, Georgia opened fire on and wounded six of his class mates.
 James Wilson, age 19, (various psychiatric drugs) from Breenwood, South Carolina, took a .22 caliber revolver into an elementary school killing two young girls, and wounding seven other children and two teachers.",1
"“We understand that we have to pick ourselves up and get on with the season as best we can until he’s back with us,” said Irving, who finished with 22 points and 10 assists in the Celtics’ 102-99 loss, a much-anticipated game that was rendered fairly meaningless. “We know G is going to be fighting to get back on the court.”
The Celtics seemed primed to challenge the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference this season, and perhaps they still can. But the reality is that so many of their hopes were wrapped up in Hayward, an outstanding shooter who figured to benefit from the attention that Irving draws from defenders. But Hayward’s absence leaves them with depleted depth on the wing.
“We were very excited to have him really flourish,” the Celtics’ Al Horford said. “It’s a setback for him. But for us, we have to keep encouraging him. He needs to take his time getting well. And knowing Gordon like I know him, I know that he will refocus and he’ll come back — and hopefully he comes back when he’s ready and it’s the right time.”
It is an obvious point, and one that was true even before they lost Hayward, but Irving will have an outsize role in dictating how the Celtics move forward from here. If he was eager to escape LeBron James’s colossal shadow in Cleveland, to forge his own path as one of the N. B.A.’s premier players, Irving has that chance now. He did not want it this way. But the rest of the league will be watching regardless.
Irving, 25, was unprepared for that sort of burden — an unfair burden — when he entered the league at age 19. James was busy winning championships with the Miami Heat, and the Cavaliers stumbled along by surrounding Irving with a collection of mismatched parts. In his first three seasons, the Cavaliers had a combined record of 78-152.
Everything changed, of course, when James returned to Cleveland: three straight trips to the N. B.A. finals and the franchise’s first championship, in 2016, a title that Irving sealed with a 3-pointer. He flourished alongside James, averaging a career-high 25.2 points a game last season.
But for whatever reason — and he has steadfastly rejected public inquiries on the topic — Irving wanted out. Cleveland honored that request by sending him to Boston, which gave up Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder and several other pieces to get him. The Celtics overhauled their roster to clear space for Irving and Hayward, a high-octane experiment worth the risk.
On Tuesday night, they almost instantly lost half of that tandem, a devastating blow for the Celtics who remained behind to play out the rest of the game. The Cavaliers built a huge lead. Then, in the second half, behind Irving and a supporting cast of promising players, the Celtics made a surge that felt therapeutic.
“The young guys we have on this team, they were really energetic,” Irving said.
In the closing seconds, Jaylen Brown, a second-year forward, tried to tie the score with a 3-pointer that caromed long. Irving’s heave at the buzzer came up short. But given the dire circumstances, Irving seemed to come away from the game feeling somewhat reassured. Brown, for example, was confident enough to take that shot.
Irving delivered that message to Brown after the game, that he had to continue to play without fear. After all, this was a team that had already experienced the worst.

"Q. Which video calling app should I be using for family conversations over the holidays?
A. cardinal rule applies here: You have to cater to the preferences of the least technically-inclined person in the group. Everybody else will wind up getting roped into providing tech support for that individual, so making things easier for him or her can only ease the work for the other people on the line.
That alone may dictate your choice between the four major choices: Apple’s FaceTime, Facebook’s Messenger, Google’s Hangoutsand Microsoft’s Skype.
Otherwise, you have to evaluate what devices each app supports and how many it lets in on a video call.
Apple’s FaceTime places the most limits. The video-calling app that Apple introduced in 2010 remains confined to iOS devices and Macs, and it also only allows video calls to one other device.
Within those contexts, however, FaceTime generally works without complaint. The only issues I’ve observed involved a MacBook Air not detecting its own camera, a system-level failure for which the app deserves no blame.
Facebook Messenger, like FaceTime, only permits person-to-person video calls but does so on more devices. You can use the social network’s iOS and Android apps but also the Firefox, Chrome, and Opera browsers on a desktop or laptop computer.
But while Facebook now collects an amazing share of the world’s population--more than one billion people checked in from their phones alone in the last quarter--you’re likely to have at least one relative who isn’t on it.
If you want to set up a group video call, direct your gaze to Google’s Hangouts and Microsoft’s Skype.
Hangouts supports up to nine people per video call, and you can use it from Google’s app of the same name for Android and iOS as well as your Web browser. You’ll need to install an extra plug-in for Firefox or Safari, but Chrome needs no extra software.
Skype, the oldest app out of all of these, offers the widest device support. Its mobile apps support not just Android and iOS but also Windows Phone and BlackBerry (although its iPhone version’s three-star rating does not suggest the happiest user base), and its desktop software runs on Windows PCs, Macs and the open-source Linux operating system.
You can also use Skype from your browser, but only Microsoft’s Edge allows that without first requiring you to install a plug-in or extension.
Skype’s help doesn’t specify an upper limit for video calls but says audio group calls are limited to 25 people.
Skype’s history and high profile, however, also raise your odds of being annoyed by spam contact requests in the app.
None of these apps are set up for sharing one-way video with a larger group of friends--for instance, if you’re unwrapping presents in a time zone ahead of or behind potential viewers. For that, the easiest choice is the Live video streaming that Facebook has been promoting in an aggressive ad campaign.
You need an Android or iOS device to broadcast a live stream, but recipients can watch in both Facebook’s mobile apps and in a browser (Live no longer seems to require Adobe’s Flash plug-in in Safari). You can share a Live broadcast as you would any other post on Facebook: to friends, close friends, friends but not acquaintances, or public.
Please tell me you’re not going to use that last option, okay?

"And The NEW Winner Of The Ugliest Dog Contest Is….
The results are in. This year’s winner is a two-year-old mutt named Peanut. Peanut stole the show with wild white and brown hair, bulging eyes and protruding teeth.
His sweet and energetic personality helped a little bit too! His owner, Holly Chandler of Greenville, North Carolina says he was seriously burned as a puppy, resulting in bald patches all over his body.
Chandler hopes Peanuts victory in the Ugliest Dog Contest, will help raise awareness about animal abuse. “We are trying to use him as a poster child for what can happen to animals who are abused,” she said. Chandler will use Peanuts $1500 price to pay for other animals veterinary bills.
This is the 26 year the contest has been held at the Sonoma – Marin Fairgrounds in Petaluma. There is a three-judge panel in several categories, including special or unusual attribute, personality and natural ugliness.
Previous winners have included a duck footed beagle, a Chinese crested and Chihuahua mix with a protruding tongue, boxer and basset hound mix with a waddle, and a Chihuahua with a missing eye and a camels back.
That sounds like a sight to see! Congratulations to Peanut, he definitely deserves the award.",1
"The following healthy power foods can claim big bragging rights: They can fend off serious diseases likediabetesand cancer and heart problems; fortify your immune system; protect and smooth your skin; and help you lose weight or stay slim.
If you’re eating most of these healthy foods already, good for you! If not, now’s the time to load up your shopping cart and supercharge your health!
Egg yolks are home to tons of essential but hard-to-get nutrients, including choline, which is linked to lower rates of breast cancer (one yolk supplies 25% of your daily need) and antioxidants that may help prevent macular degeneration and cataracts. Though many of us have shunned whole eggs because of their link to heart disease risk, there’s actually substantial evidence that for most of us, eggs are not harmful but healthy.
People with heart disease should limit egg yolks to two a week, but the rest of us can have one whole egg daily; research shows it won’t raise your risk of heart attack or stroke. Make omelets with one whole egg and two whites, and watch cholesterol at other meals.
Yogurt is a great way to get calcium, and it’s also rich in immune-boosting bacteria. But next time you hit the yogurt aisle, pick up the Greek kind—compared with regular yogurt, it has twice the protein (and 25% of women over 40 don’t get enough). Look for fat-free varieties like Oikos Organic Greek Yogurt (90 calories and 15 g of protein per 5.3-ounce serving).
Yes, it does a body good: Studies show that calcium isn’t just a bone booster but a fat fighter too. Recent research from the University of Tennessee found that obese people who went on a low-calorie, calcium-rich diet lost 70% more weight than those who ate the least. Vitamin Dnot only allows your body to absorb calcium, it’s also a super nutrient in its own right. Recent research found that adequate D levels can reduce heart disease risk, ward off certain types of cancer, relieve back pain, and even help prevent depression, but most of us don’t get nearly enough of the 1,000+ IU daily that most experts recommend.
A splash of milk in your morning coffee isn’t enough to provide the calcium and vitamin D you need. Use milk instead of water to make your oatmeal, have a glass with breakfast, or stir some chocolate syrup into it for an after-dinner treat.
Salmon is a rich source of vitamin D and one of the best sources of omega-3syou can find. These essential fatty acids have a wide range of impressive health benefits—from preventing heart disease to smoothing your skin and aiding weight loss to boosting your mood and minimizing the effects of arthritis. Unfortunately, many Americans aren’t reaping these perks because we’re deficient, which some experts believe may be at the root of many of the big health problems today, like obesity, heart disease, and cancer.
Omega-3s also slow the rate of digestion, which makes you feel fuller longer, so you eat fewer calories throughout the day.
Lean beef is one of the best-absorbed sources of iron there is. (Too-little iron can cause anemia.) Adding as little as 1 ounce of beef per day can make a big difference in the body’s ability to absorb iron from other sources, says Mary J. Kretsch, PhD, a researcher at the USDA-ARS Western Human Nutrition Research Center in Davis, CA. Beef also packs plenty of zinc (even minor deficiencies may impair memory) and B vitamins, which help your body turn food into energy.
If you can, splurge on grass-fed. Compared with grain-fed beef, it has twice the concentration of vitamin E, a powerful brain-boosting antioxidant. It’s also high in omega-3 fatty acids. Because this type of beef tends to be lower in overall fat, it can be tough—so marinate it, and use a meat thermometer to avoid overcooking.
It’s hard to imagine a more perfect food than beans. One cooked cupful can provide as much as 17 g fiber. They’re also loaded with protein and dozens of key nutrients, including a few most women fall short on—calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Studies tie beans to a reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and breast and colon cancers.
The latest dietary guidelines recommend consuming at least 3 cups of beans a week—3 times the measly 1 cup we usually get. Keep your cupboards stocked with all kinds: black, white, kidney, fat-free refried, etc. Use them in salads, stuffed baked potatoes, and veggie chili or pureed for sandwich spreads.
In a nutshell: USDA researchers say that eating 1 ounces of tree nuts daily can reduce your risk of heart disease and diabetes. Walnuts are rich in omega-3s. Hazelnuts contain arginine, an amino acid that may lower blood pressure.An ounce of almonds has as many heart-healthy polyphenols as a cup of green tea and 1/2 cup of steamed broccoli combined; they may help lower LDL cholesterol as well.
The key is moderation, since nuts are high in calories. Keep a jar of chopped nuts in your fridge, and sprinkle a tablespoon on cereal, salads, stir-fries, or yogurt. Or have an ounce as a snack most days of the week.
Soy’s days as a cure-all may be over—some claims, such as help for hot flashes, don’t seem to be panning out—but edamame still has an important place on your plate. Foods such as tofu, soy milk, and edamame help fight heart disease when they replace fatty meats and cheeses, slashing saturated fat intake. Soy also contains heart-healthy polyunsaturated fats, a good amount of fiber, and some important vitamins.
Soy’s isoflavones, or plant estrogens, may also help prevent breast cancer. Some researchers believe these bind with estrogen receptors, reducing your exposure to the more powerful effects of your own estrogen, saysPreventionadvisor Andrew Weil, MD. But stick with whole soy foods rather than processed foods, like patties or chips, made with soy powder. Don’t take soy supplements, which contain high and possibly dangerous amounts of isoflavones.
Fiber-rich oats are even healthier than the FDA thought when it first stamped them with a heart diseaseìreducing seal 10 years ago. According to new research, they can also cut your risk of type 2 diabetes.When Finnish researchers tracked 4,316 men and women over the course of 10 years, they found that people who ate the highest percentage of cereal fiber were 61% less likely to develop type 2 diabetes.
To reap the benefits, eat 1/2 cup daily—preferably unsweetened. For a versatile breakfast, top with different combinations of fruit, yogurt, and nuts. You can also use oats to coat fish or chicken or add texture to meatballs.
Flaxseed is the most potent plant source of omega-3 fats. Studies indicate that adding flaxseed to your diet can reduce the development of heart disease by 46%—it helps keep red blood cells from clumping together and forming clots that can block arteries. It may also reduce breast cancer odds. In one study, women who ate 10 g of flaxseed (about 1 rounded tablespoon) every day for 2 months had a 25% improvement in the ratio of breast cancerìprotective to breast cancerìpromoting chemicals in their blood.
Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of flaxseed a day on your cereal, salad, or yogurt. Buy it preground, and keep it refrigerated.
Olive oil is full of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats (MUFAs), which lower “bad” LDL cholesterol and raise “good” HDL cholesterol. It’s rich in antioxidants, which may help reduce the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases, like Alzheimer’s.
Look for extra virgin oils for the most antioxidants and flavor. Drizzle small amounts on veggies before roasting; use it to sauté or stir-fry, in dressings and marinades, and to flavor bread at dinner in lieu of a layer of butter or margarine.
These smooth, buttery fruits are a great source of not only MUFAs but other key nutrients as well. One Ohio State University study found that when avocado was added to salads and salsa, it helped increase the absorption of specific carotenoids, plant compounds linked to lower risk of heart disease and macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness. “Avocados are packed with heart-protective compounds, such as soluble fiber, vitamin E, folate, and potassium,” says Elizabeth Somer, RD, author of 10 Habits That Mess Up a Woman’s Diet.
But they are a bit high in calories. To avoid weight gain, use avocado in place of another high-fat food or condiment, such as cheese or mayo.
Pick any life-threatening disease—cancer, heart disease, you name it—and eating more broccoli and its cruciferous cousins may help you beat it, Johns Hopkins research suggests. Averaging just four weekly servings of veggies like broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower slashed the risk of dying from any disease by 26% among 6,100 people studied for 28 years.
For maximum disease-fighting benefits, whip out your old veggie steamer. It turns out that steaming broccoli lightly releases the maximum amount of sulforaphane.
We’ll spare you the Popeye jokes, but spinach has serious health muscles. For one thing, it contains lots of lutein, the sunshine-yellow pigment found in egg yolks. Aside from guarding against age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness, lutein may prevent heart attacks by keeping artery walls clear of cholesterol.
Spinach is also rich in iron, which helps deliver oxygen to your cells for energy, and folate, a B vitamin that prevents birth defects. Cook frozen spinach leaves (they provide more iron when cooked than raw) and serve as a side dish with dinner a few times a week.
Tomatoes are our most common source of lycopene, an antioxidant that may protect against heart disease and breast cancer. The only problem with tomatoes is that we generally eat them in the form of sugar-loaded jarred spaghetti sauce or as a thin slice in a sandwich. For a healthier side dish idea, quarter plum tomatoes and coat with olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Roast in a 400°F oven for 20 minutes, and serve with chicken.
One of the best ways to get vitamin A—an essential nutrient that protects and maintains eyes, skin, and the linings of our respiratory, urinary, and intestinal tracts—is from foods containing beta-carotene, which your body converts into the vitamin. Beta caroteneìrich foods include carrots, squash, kale, and cantaloupe, but sweet potatoes have among the most. A half-cup serving of these sweet spuds delivers only 130 calories but 80% of the DV of vitamin A. Replace tonight’s fries with one medium baked sweet potato (1,096 mcg) and you’re good to go—and then some.
Garlic is a flavor essential and a health superstar in its own right. The onion relative contains more than 70 active phytochemicals, including allicin, which studies show may decrease high blood pressure by as much as 30 points. High consumption of garlic lowered rates of ovarian, colorectal, and other cancers, according to a research review in theAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Allicin also fights infection and bacteria. British researchers gave 146 people either a placebo or a garlic extract for 12 weeks; garlic takers were two-thirds less likely to catch a cold.
The key to healthier garlic: Crush the cloves, and let them stand for up to 30 minutes before heating them, which activates and preserves the heart-protecting compounds, according to a 2007 study from Argentina.
Citrus fruits get all the credit for Vitamin C,but red peppers are actually the best source. Vitamin C may be best known for skin and immunity benefits. Researchers in the United Kingdom looked at vitamin C intake in 4,025 women and found that those who ate more had less wrinkling and dryness. And although getting enough vitamin C won’t prevent you from catching a cold or flu, studies show that it could help you recover faster.
Vitamin C has other important credentials too. Finnish researchers found that men with low levels were 2.4 times likelier to have a stroke, and Australian scientists recently discovered that the antioxidant reduces knee pain by protecting your knees against arthritis.
When you think of potassium-rich produce, figs probably don’t come to mind, but you may be surprised to learn that six fresh figs have 891 mg of the blood pressure-lowering mineral, nearly 20% of your daily need—and about double what you’d find in one large banana. In a recent 5-year study from the Netherlands, high-potassium diets were linked with lower rates of death from all causes in healthy adults age 55 and older. Figs are one of the best fruit sources of calcium, with nearly as much per serving (six figs) as 1/2 cup of fat-free milk.
Serve by chopping and adding to yogurt, cottage cheese, oatmeal, or green salads. Or enjoy them as a savory snack: Cut a slit in the side and stuff with 1/2 teaspoon of a low-fat version of a soft cheese such as ch?vre or Brie.
Blueberries may very well be the most potent age-defying food—they’re jam-packed with antioxidants. When researchers at Cornell University tested 25 fruits for these potent compounds, they found that tangy-sweet wild blueberries (which are smaller than their cultivated cousins) packed the most absorbable antioxidants. Research shows a diet rich in blueberries can help with memory loss, prevent urinary tract infections, and relieve eyestrain.
Add up to 1/2 cup of blueberries to your diet a day for maximum health benefits, recommends Ronald Prior, PhD, adjunct professor of food science at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. This alone provides just about double the amount of antioxidants most Americans get in 1 day.
One large Asian pear has a whopping 10 g of cholesterol-lowering fiber, about 40% of your daily need. People who ate the most fiber had the lowest total and LDL cholesterol levels, according to a recent study of Baltimore adults. The same researchers found that people who ate the most fiber also weighed the least and had the lowest body mass index and waist circumference.
Serve by dicing it into a salad of Boston lettuce, crumbled goat cheese, walnuts, and mandarin oranges. Or make it a dessert: Add peeled and cored pears to a saucepan with 1 cup white wine, 1 teaspoon honey, 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger, and enough water to cover the pears. Cover and simmer 40 minutes or until pears are soft.
A French study published in theJournal of Nutritionfound that lychee has the second-highest level of heart-healthy polyphenols of all fruits tested—nearly 15% more than the amount found in grapes (cited by many as polyphenol powerhouses). The compounds may also play an important role in the prevention of degenerative diseases such as cancer.
Serve by peeling or breaking the outer covering just below the stem; use a knife to remove the black pit. Add to stir-fries or skewer onto chicken kebabs to add a sweet, grapelike flavor.
One of the healthiest fruits you should be eating is one you probably already are: the apple. The Iowa Women’s Health Study, which has been investigating the health habits of 34,000 women for nearly 20 years, named apples as one of only three foods (along with pears and red wine) that are most effective at reducing the risk of death from heart disease among postmenopausal women. Other massive studies have found the fruit to lower risk of lung cancer and type 2 diabetes—and even help women lose weight.
In fact, one of the only things that could make an apple unhealthy is mixing it with sugar, flour, and butter and stuffing it into a mile-high pie. Instead, have one as an afternoon snack with a tablespoon of peanut butter, or add slices to sandwiches or salads.
Native to South America, this tropical fruit is an excellent source of skin-healing vitamin C, with 250% of your RDA per serving. One cup of guava has nearly 5 times as much C as a medium orange (377 mg versus 83 mg)—that’s more than 5 times your daily need. It’s also loaded with lycopene (26% more than a tomato), which may help lower your risk of heart disease. And according to research by microbiologists in Bangladesh, guava can even protect against foodborne pathogens such as Listeria and staph.
You can buy guava juice, or simmer chunks in water as you would to make applesauce. Guava also makes a super smoothie: Blend 1/2 banana, 1/2 ripe guava, a handful of strawberries, 1/2 cup soy milk, and a few ice cubes.
Thank you, dark chocolate, for making us feel good—not guilty—about dessert. Dark chocolate is filled with flavonoid antioxidants (more than 3 times the amount in milk chocolate) that keep blood platelets from sticking together and may even unclog your arteries. It may also help with weight loss by keeping you feeling full, according to a study from Denmark. Researchers gave 16 participants 100 g of either dark or milk chocolate and 2 hours later offered them pizza. Those who consumed the dark chocolate ate 15% fewer calories than those who had milk chocolate, and they were less interested in fatty, salty, and sugary foods.
Try a chocolate with 70% or more cocoa. Two tablespoons of dark chocolate chips with fresh berries as a mid-afternoon snack or after-dinner dessert should give you some of the heart-healthy benefits without busting your calorie budget.",1

"Paul Walker and his friend were killed shortly after they discovered a conspiracy to supply victims of Typhon Haiyan with a prototype permanent birth control drug hidden in medicinal supplies and food aid. They had a damning recording and they were on their way to rendezvous with an ally who would have helped them get in touch with the right people. Turns out they were betrayed and someone rigged their car’s breaks to malfunction after a certain speed.
Now that the loose end has been tied up, and the recording destroyed, the people responsible have nothing to fear as this will become another “conspiracy theory” no one will take seriously.
“Now here is another thread with a conspiracy on a possible motive here. Apparently, Paul Walker had discovered dirty money in the Philippines disaster relief and that would make sense because he owned a company that specialized in rapid disaster relief. “
Did Walker dig to deep into corruption or was it anIlluminati Death?Then we have the massive damage to the car, the two videos below show thesame car Paul Walker was killed in that had also been involved in an ultra high speed crash with fatalities and then the video of the aerial view of Walker’s car after the fatal crash. If either of those theories over at GLP is correct, then the words Walker spoke in his 2000 hit The Skulls, when he said “If you keep digging you will dig your own grave,” were highly prophetic.(Shown below)",1

Gout is a type of arthritis that causes an inflammation of joints, which is manifested by serious pain, swellings and stiffness. And the reason of this condition is the extreme amounts of uric acid in the body, that is crystallized in which the joints.
This acid is produced by decomposing the chemicals called purines that naturally occur in the body and can also be found in certain foods. That is why you should avoid consuming high-purine foods because they will increase the levels of uric acid in your body and cause an advancement of gout.
That is why you must change your diet and lifestyle.
First of all, you should minimize the consumption of meat and seafood because they contain a lot of purines. You should also consume more fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains, as well as asparagus, beans, and lentils because they are really low in purines.
You should also limit the consumption of processed sugars such as high- fructose corn syrup, foods rich in saturated fats and alcohol.
It is confirmed that the excess weight significantly considerably contributes to the development of gout, which is why it is important to regularly work out and have a healthy diet plan. It is also important to drink a lot of water since it hydrates the body and helps the elimination of uric acid from the body. Drink more natural teas, freshly squeezed juices, and fruit instilled water.
There are also certain natural remedies that you can use, such as example apple cider vinegar. It will effectively alkalize the body and break down uric acid because of the malic acid that it contains. You should regularly drink one glass of 8 ounces of water and a tablespoon of vinegar, two times a day, before lunch and dinner.
Scientists have discovered that baking soda is very good for decreasing the amounts of uric acid in the body which enables it to prevent gout. That is why you can also drink one glass of water and half a teaspoon of baking soda every morning. You can even add a whole teaspoon in the water if you already have gout.
Another natural remedy for gout is lemon water. It alkalizes the body, which actually prevents a lot of health problems, including gout. You can just add some lemon juice in your glass of water in order to raise the alkalinity of the body and stop the development of acid crystals. You can squeeze half a lemon into 8 ounces of warm water and drink it every day in the morning, on an empty stomach.

When a site has HTTPS turned on, someone trying to get a peek at your online activity can typically see only what site you'revisiting,not the actual page you're on or what information you might share on a site. So right now, for instance, someone with access to the network you're connecting throughcould see that you're reading The Post, but not that you're reading this specific article about encryption. Neat, right? Major e-mail providers, social networks, and all sorts of e-commerce such as online shopping and banking rely on encryption to help keep users' data safe, often without visitors even realizing it because the encryption is just baked into how users experience the Internet. But over the past year, the U. S. government has been mired in a debate over encryption, one that some intelligence and law enforcement officials have tried to rekindle in the wake of the recent attacks inParis and San Bernardino, Calif. Inatelevised address on Sunday, President Obamaeven alluded to the issue,saying he ""will urge high-tech and law enforcement leaders to make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice."" And now, thechairman of the House Homeland Security Committee is calling for a commission on encryption and security threats. So let's take a step back and talk about thistechnology and why it's in the spotlight. Where does encryption come from and how does it work? The concepts behind modern encryption are really old. In fact,Julius Caesar used a form of encryption known now as a ""Caesar cipher"" to protect the privacy of his messages. In a Caesar cipher, each letter gets replaced by another letter some fixed number of steps away in the alphabet.For example, if the cipher is used to shift one position to the right, A becomes B, and B becomes C. So a message like ""Hi Mom"" becomes""Ij Npn"" — basically nonsense to someone who doesn't understandyoursuper-secret code. Computers have made coding information through these sorts of systems much faster — and more complex.But at their most basic level, modern forms of digital encryption are math.  Okay, more specifically, they use mathematical algorithms to scramble up data. That scrambling is associated with a digital ""key"" that unlocks it. If you don't have the key, the encrypted data will look just like gibberish, such as that ""Ij Npn"" message we made using the Caesar cipher.As a general rule,the longer and more complex the key, the harder it is for someone to ""break"" or decode whatever you've encrypted. Okay, but how isencryption actually used? There are two basic ways people use digital encryption. The first is to lockup data ""at rest,"" or when you're trying to protect information that's stored somewhere, such as on your computer or your smartphone. You can think of it sort of like a combination safe for your data. In most cases, you use a password or passcode tounlock it. This kind of protection is especially useful if a device gets lost or stolen because it means that whoever gets a hold of it won't be able to dig through whatever personal information might be stored on it. The second is to secure data ""in transit,"" or when you're trying to protect information as it travels across the Internet. Here, you can think of encryption as sort of a decoder ring: The two sides of a digital conversation exchange keys that let them understand what each side is saying but prevent others from being able to understand it. The most secure form of this type of ""in transit"" encryption is called ""end-to-end."" It means that only the sender and the recipient of a message can unlock it — so, basically, only each ""end"" of the conversation holds the keys. Some ofthe most advanced forms of ""end-to-end"" use something called ""perfect forward secrecy,"" which works by having each new message serve as a kind of key for the next message. That means that even if someone is able to break into one message, they aren't able to necessarily unlock the whole conversation. HTTPS is actually a form of end-to-end encryption, but instead of connecting two people, it connects one person to the server that hosts a website. And that means that the company behind a site can unlock the data. For instance, Gmail uses HTTPS by default when you connect to its e-mail system from the Web. That means that there's automatically ""end-to-end"" encryption between users and Google, but not directly between one Gmail user and another Gmail user. That's why Google can unlock your e-mails so it can do things like use them to help decide what advertisements to show you and let you easily search through your archives. (Although, it's worth noting that Google is working on a browser extensionto help Gmail users send e-mails that are encrypted end-to-end.) Similarly, when you buy something online, HTTPS protects your credit card data as it crosses the Web but lets the company or whatever payment processor it uses read it so you are actually able to pay for things. So why is the government freaking out about encryption? It's not, really. Or at least, not all of it is freaking out about all kinds of encryption. In fact, Obama himself and many of the officials who have expressed concern about some types of encryption have expressed support for encryptiongenerally and acknowledge that it plays a key role in keeping data safe from hackers. Thefederal government actuallyis in the midst of trying to roll out HTTPS to all of its websitesright now because of the privacy and security benefits it offers. But some law enforcement and intelligence officials are worried about big tech companies rolling out products that automatically use the strongest forms of encryption to protect users' data. This trend was already underway before former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations about the extent of thegovernment'ssurveillance powers but has since gained steam — with an added boost from awave of data breaches at major companies. The end result of that push is that some tech companies are replacing systems in which they previously could unlock data with ones in which they can't because they decided to stop holdingon to the keys. Apple is probably the most notable example here. It has used end-to-end encryption for products such as iMessage and Facetime for a while now. And in fall 2014, it announced that iOS would automatically encrypt data stored on smartphones and other mobile devices with a key that's based on a user's passcode or password and stored locally on their device. That means that if users have turned off automatic backups to Apple's servers, the company doesn't have a way toaccess their data. That's a problem for some law enforcement officials because it means that the company is just unable to unlock data stored on a phone, even if it's served with a court order. Those officials warn that these protections let criminals and terrorists ""go dark"" and hide their communications from investigators. And in some cases, they have pushed for companies to roll back these new protections or redesign them to build in ways for the government toaccess encrypted informationfromtheir products. Encryption experts typically call that kind of an access point a ""backdoor.""  Yes. Although it's worth noting that government officials who want this accessgenerally reject that term. Instead, they say that they are asking for a ""front door"" — a system by which they are able to unlock encrypted information if they have received judicial approval. But experts, tech companies and privacy advocates say that no matter what you call it, an access point like that weakens encryption. Actually, they argue that there are a lot of problems with the approach: One is thatbuilding in that sort of access will introducemore opportunities for someone to mess up the code and include bugs that leave systems vulnerable to hackers. Another more basic problem, they say, is that it's really hard to control who will have access to a door when you build one. Hackers, they warn, will target the door and almost inevitably find a way to break in.And if the United States passes a law that requires a door and gets it, how are companies that operate globally supposed to react if another country such as China or Russia demands the same thing? That question actually speaks to a really basic tension inside the U.S. government over encryption: Some parts ofthe governmentactually help fund the development of strong, end-to-end encrypted products because they help protect journalists and activistsin countries that crack down on the Internet through censorship and surveillance. But other parts are worried that thosesametools make it harder for them to track terrorists and criminals. Since Apple announced its iOS changes last year, the U.S. government hasdebated this issue at length. But internal documents from that debate suggest that officials couldn't figure out a way to build the kind of access some wanted without creating other security risks that their own experts believed would outweigh the benefits. So, in October, the administration said it didn't plan to push for legislation that would require companies such as Appletobe able tounlock encrypteddatafor the government — at least at that point. But then the Nov. 13 Paris attacks — claimed by the Islamic State militant group — revived that conversation. Wait, how was encryption involved in the Paris attacks? That's not totally clear, but in the immediate aftermath, some officials pointed specifically to increasingly popular end-to-end encrypted messaging apps as possible planning ground for the attacks. There's actually some signs that they didn'tuse encryption. For instance, investigators found a phone apparently belonging to one of the attackers that included an unencrypted text message thought to be a signal to launch the attacks and used information from the phone to help track down the alleged mastermind of the plot, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, according to local reports. That's not to say that the Islamic State doesn't use encryption or doesn't know about it — and there are other signs that some of the attackers may have used the tools. A New York Times reportlast month said that officials believe Abaaoud started to use encryption after a planned attack in Belgium was foiled by phonetaps. Earlier this year, Abaaoud gave one would-be attacker a USB stick with an encryption key on it and told him to await instructions via email, according to thereport. Numerous reports have also linked Islamic State supporters to Telegram, a messaging app that allows for end-to-end encrypted ""secret"" chats, as well as public channels. The developers have since cracked downon jihadists' use of public channels to spread propaganda. But this isn't really new: Terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, were reported to be using encryption tools as far back as the 1990s, long before the Snowden revelations helped set off the current expansion of consumer end-to-end encrypted messaging products. Can the government stop terrorists from using encryption? Well, no. The most the government can probably do is bar companies from offering the most secure forms of encryption to their users. But encryption isn't just one product. Just like the math it's based on, it's reallymore of a concept or an idea rather than a specifictechnical tool. And it's pretty impossible to outlaw ideas. In fact, the U.S. already tried to do that in the 1990s in policy debates about encryption now known as the ""crypto wars"" — which failed to stop the spread of encryption and ended up creating a bunch of security problems that still haunt the Internet. Even if the government stopped big tech companies from offering end-to-end encryption, the tech would still be available. For one, the U.S. government has little authority to stop corporations outside its borders from offering the same capabilities. But perhaps more importantly, many other popular encrypted communication apps and tools are the result of open-source projects that rely on volunteerdevelopers all around the worldto make them better, so there's no one person or company that the government can get to shut them down. And because open-source projects make their code available to the public, there's nothingto stop Islamic State supporters from using their own servers to set up their own versions of end-to-end messaging apps. And if they don't want to go that far, terrorists could revert to older, more cumbersome open-source products that provide end-to-end encryption for things such as emailthat are also already out there. That's why many privacy advocates argue that stopping companies from offering the strongest forms of encryption would probably only hurt the privacy of everyday users: Someone who is doing something they know is high-risk, such as planning a crime or a terrorist attack, is probably willing to deal with going through some extra steps to communicate securely.Your grandparents might not, even if they're talking about something that could be sensitive down the line, such as personal health information. So how can the government get around encryption to help fight crime and terrorism? The good news is that the government has options.Remember how I said that someone spying on your connection with this site could still see that you're looking at The Post even if they can't see which page? Even if you can't decode the content of an encrypted message, someone watching online traffic or providing a communication service can still generally see who is on each side of a conversation and when they're talking. If analyzed correctly, that kind of information, dubbed ""metadata,"" can help law enforcement get a good idea of what a target's social web looks like. If the government gets access to encrypted data stored on a device, in some cases it will be able to ""brute force"" its way through the protections. That means throwing a bunch of computing power at the information to break the encryption. One way to do that isby trying all the possible keys — and it's something that the government is in a position to do because it has a lot more resources than the average hacker. But the government can also resort to plain old hacking: Although it doesn't talk about it much, different agencies have teams that try to figure out how to infect targets' computers with viruses and malware. And if you are able to infect someone's whole phone or whole computer, you can generally find ways to get around encryption, such asspying in on when someone enters the password to unlock it or accessing information before it gets encrypted. These aren't perfect solutions — they may take longer to unlock data or not work at all in some circumstances —but they are alternatives to approaches such as backdoors, which many experts say could leave everyone less secure.  Who knows, really. It's not clear what the U.S. government's next steps will be on this, and some European countries are debating many of the same issues. But this issue clearly isn't going away anytime soon — and, hopefully, this guide has at least helped you understand how the technology actually works and what's at stake in those debates.

Are there good and bad sugars?Open navigatorAm I eating too much sugar?How can I check food labels for added sugar?Why is it so hard to give up sugar?How can I reduce my sugar intake?
Sugar consumption is at its highest level in history. Global consumption of added sugar has increased by a whopping 46% per person per day in the last 30 years.
We are born with a preference for sweet foods and sugar has played a vital role in our survival at times when food has been scarce. But in our sugar-coated world our preference for sweet foods has led to excessive consumption.
With some media headlines describing sugar as 'poison' and numerous studies linking it directly or indirectly to obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay, it would seem there is cause for concern. But is sugar all bad – and is all sugar bad?
Am I eating too much sugar?The World Health Organisation (WHO) strongly recommends we reduce our daily intake of free sugars to less than 10% of our total calorie intake (about 12 tsp per day). It calls for a further reduction to less than 5% (about 6 tsp per day) if possible. We once primarily ate sugars that naturally occurred in fruit and vegetables, but research suggests that added sugar is now the main source of sugar in our diets.
The problem with added sugar is that it is not bound up with other nutrients, such as fibre. The WHO uses the term ‘free sugars’ to describe free-floating sugars that are instantly absorbed by the digestive system.  All sugar that is added to our food is classified as ‘free sugars'. A concern with free sugars is that they make it easy to eat excess calories; you may drink a can of soft drink but you would not eat four apples because the fibre in the apples makes you feel full. Free sugars are not necessary for a balanced diet.
It is commonly believed that honey is a healthy alternative to sugar. But this isn't true; honey is a sugar. When we think of sugar, we often think of table sugar, but sugar is a blanket term for sweet-tasting, energy dense carbohydrates. Table sugar consists of two simple sugars bonded together. These simple sugars are glucose and fructose. Honey is also made up of glucose and fructose.
Honey, along with maple syrup, agave nectar and rice malt syrup, is in the ‘free sugars’ club and needs to be restricted. Free sugars are also found in fruit juices, as they do not tend to contain the fibre found in whole fruit and vegetables.
To your body it does not matter whether free sugar comes from honey or table sugar. The bottom line is that honey brings added sugar and calories to your diet and needs to be restricted.
In the sugar debate fructose is often portrayed as the villain. But is fructose, also known as fruit sugar, worse than other sugars?
Concern about fructose focuses on how it is processed by the body. All cells in the body can process glucose, whereas only the liver can process fructose in significant amounts, which means that excessive consumption may tax the liver. It has also been suggested that fructose interferes with the proper functioning of the hormones ghrelin, which signals hunger to the brain, and leptin, which generates a feeling of satiety. This may cause us to over-eat.
Could fructose be healthier than glucose?
Some claim fructose is healthier than other sugars as it has a low glycaemic index so does not raise blood sugar levels as much as glucose. In fact, as of 2015 food manufacturers in Europe who substitute other sugars with fructose can put a health claim on their products.
A problem with research in this area is that studies involve consuming fructose in far greater quantities than we would eat in a regular diet, so they are not easy to draw conclusions from. Overall there is a consensus that there is no significant difference between fructose and glucose in terms of their implications for health.
How can I check food labels for added sugar?Food manufacturers do not have to state how much sugar they have added to food, but instead they give a figure for total sugars. Here are clues to help you work out if a food is likely to be high in added sugar.Look at the labelsLook at 'carbohydrates (of which sugars)' on the nutrition label. If the total sugar content is over 22.5g per 100g the food is high in sugar; if it is below 5g per 100g the food is low in sugar. The traffic light system can also help identify sugary foods; red sugar labels represent food high in sugar, amber represents medium sugar content and green signals low sugar content. But this system is based on total sugars, so some foods such as natural yoghurt may be labelled amber even though they contain no added sugar – just naturally-occuring sugar. Don’t rely solely on traffic lights; you also need to look at the ingredients list. Check where sugar appears in the ingredients list. If it is near the beginning of the list then the food is probably high in added sugar.
Check if sugar is hiding under these names
Why is it so hard to give up sugar?
Throughout our lives we are given sugar as a form of reward and consume it at celebrations. When was the last time you were at a children's birthday party with no cake? This has led to us associating sugar with pleasure. Just as we have learned to derive pleasure from sugar, we can also teach our tastebuds to enjoy foods that are less sweet. But this takes times, so stick with it.
When we consume free sugars, they are quickly absorbed by our bloodstream and we experience pleasure and an energy boost. Our blood sugar levels spike and then drop. This is sometimes referred to as a ‘sugar crash’. These ‘sugar crashes’ make us crave sugar and the cycle of cravings and crashes continues. How can I fend off sugar cravings?
Make sure you have healthy snacks, such as nuts and seeds, at hand. These are high in fat and protein, and so are useful for keeping hunger at bay.
Craving chocolate? Enjoy small amounts of good quality dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa solids), which has a lower sugar content than milk or white chocolate.
Try adding some cinnamon to your morning coffee or sprinkling it over porridge. A sprinkle of cocoa can also go a long way in pleasing your sweet tooth.
Sugar alternatives such as stevia can be useful for sugar-free baking. Stevia is a natural sweetener derived from a plant. It is virtually calorie-free, does not affect blood sugar levels and does not cause tooth decay.
Often sugar cravings are a mental phenomenon based on the pleasure we get when we eat sugar. Distract yourself by taking a short walk, reading or listening to some music.

"Helium and Indium, elements from the periodic table of elements, are becoming endangered. This has to do, in part, with our massive use of smart phones.
Animals tend to be most commonly referred to as endangered, but scientists also consider numerous elements to be in dangerously short supply. In fact, 44 elements in the periodic table are considered to exist in limited quantities, and 9 of these have been categorized as seriously threatened in the next 100 years. One of them is helium which is only second to hydrogen as the universe’s most abundant element, but its overuse has made it vulnerable.
Indium is also on the serious list because of its relatively low concentrations compared to the high demand for its integral role in touchscreens for smartphones and tablets.
In fact, scientists are particularly concerned about the drain smartphones are having on minerals and chemicals, with one remarking at a conference last year that they are made with 60 to 70 elements which, according to him, “has led to issues related to availability.” It’s important to note, though, that elements cannot actually become extinct because they are, for the most part, indestructible. Rather, humans are extracting them at a high enough level that access to desired quantities will become too limited or expensive.",1
"In 2003, Rick Simpson healed himself of skin cancer using cannabis oil. This is the recipe he perfected and recommends to others seeking to heal holistically.
Someday, everyone will know the name ‘Rick Simpson’. Why? Because, according to sources, the man rediscovered the cure for cancer. After being diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma skin cancer in 2003, Rick underwent conventional treatment and surgery. The Western method of ‘treating’ the issue, however, did little to benefit his condition.
Getting desperate, Rick decided to do something drastic – at least in the eyes of the mainstream.
Rick remembered that thirty years prior, the University of Virginia discovered that cannabinoid in cannabis THC could kill cancer in mice. He figured, “If it works for mice, why not for me?” Therefore, began applying cannabis oil to his skin cancer.
He figured that if the oil didn’t help within four days, he would give up the practice. Amazingly, in just that short period of time, his cancer disappeared. That’s when Simpson knew he was onto something.
Simpson’s success inspired others to give cannabis oil a try as an alternative treatment for cancer. And guess what? The therapy has proven to be wildly successful for a wide variety of ailments.
In fact, even the U.S. National Cancer Institute recently admitted that marijuana kills cancer cells.
Because of such, the public’s perception of the herb as a medicine has changed drastically in recent years.
Which means, if you or someone you know is suffering from cancer, it might be the time you try out Rick Simpson’s personal cannabis oil recipe.
IMPORTANT: These instructions are directly summarized from Rick Simpson’s website. Be VERY careful when boiling solvent off, the fumes are extremely flammable. AVOID smoking, sparks, stove-tops and red-hot heating elements. Set up a fan to blow fumes away from the pot, and set up in a well-ventilated area for whole process.
Homemade Medicinal Cannabis Oil
By Rick Simpson
Start with one ounce of dried herb. One ounce will typically produce 3-4 grams of oil, although the amount of oil produced per ounce will vary strain to strain. A pound of dried material will yield about two ounces of high quality oil.
1. Place the completely dry material in a plastic bucket.
2. Dampen the material with the solvent you are using. Many solvents can be used. You can use pure naphtha, ether, butane, or 99% isopropyl alcohol. Two gallons of solvent is required to extract the THC from one pound, and 500 ml is enough for an ounce.
3. Crush the plant material using a stick of clean, untreated wood or any other similar device. Although the material will be damp, it will still be relatively easy to crush up because it is so dry.
4. Continue to crush the material with the stick, while adding solvent until the plant material is completely covered and soaked. Remain stirring the mixture for about three minutes. As you do this, the THC is dissolved off the material into the solvent.
5. Pour the solvent-oil mixture off the plant material into another bucket. At this point, you have stripped the material of about 80% of its THC.
6. Second wash: again add solvent to the mixture and work for another three minutes to extract the remaining THC.
7. Pour this solvent-oil mix into the bucket containing the first mix that was previously poured out.
8. Discard the twice washed plant material.
9. Pour the solvent-oil mixture through a coffee filter into a clean container.
10. Boil the solvent off: a rice cooker will boil the solvent off nicely, and will hold over a half gallon of solvent mixture. CAUTION: avoid stove-tops, red-hot elements, sparks, cigarettes and open flames as the fumes are extremely flammable.
11. Add solvent to rice cooker until it is about  full and turn on HIGH heat. Make sure you are in a well-ventilated area and set up a fan to carry the solvent fumes away. Continue to add mixture to cooker as solvent evaporates until you have added it all to the cooker.
12. As the level in the rice cooker decreases for the last time, add a few drops of water (about 10 drops of water for a pound of dry material). This will help to release the solvent residue, and protect the oil from too much heat.
13. When there is about one inch of solvent-water mixture in the rice cooker, put on your oven mitts and pick the unit up and swirl the contents until the solvent has finished boiling off.
14. When the solvent has been boiled off, turn the cooker to LOW heat. At no point should the oil ever reach over 290 degrees F or 140 degrees C.
15. Keep your oven mitts on and remove the pot containing the oil from the rice cooker. Gently pour the oil into a stainless steel container
16. Place the stainless steel container in a dehydrator, or put it on a gentle heating device such as a coffee warmer. It may take a few hours but the water and volatile terpenes will be evaporated from the oil. When there is no longer any surface activity on the oil, it is ready for use.
17. Suck the oil up in a plastic syringe, or in any other container you see fit. A syringe will make the oil easy to dispense. When the oil cools completely it will have the consistency of thick grease.For dosage information, you can check out more on Rick’s website.

"Cali, leading the way to tofu eating, sandal wearing, cry baby, achievement trophy holding liberals! Thank God the election of Trump is stopping this mentality in it’s tracks! Poor kids can’t have meat and cheese in their lunches over in Oakland, California because of that mentality.
FOE (Friends Of the Earth) gave kids a lunch menu designed to eliminate foods it says are “unsustainable for our planet.” The new menu features far less meat and more plant-based food. Any meat or cheese the school did use came from “pastured, organic dairy cows.” The student’s lunch menu went from beef hot dogs and pepperoni pizza to vegan stir fry tofu and vegan tostadas. The new FOE-approved menu both se[rv]ed meat and cheese less frequently and reduced the portion sizes.
“This is a landmark moment for school food,” Jennifer LeBarre, head of nutrition services for Oakland Unified School District, said in a FOE press statement. “We were so excited to see how the data showed that we could reduce our carbon and water footprint by serving healthy, delicious food –– like the vegetarian tostadas with fresh made in-house salsa, that kids absolutely love –– all while saving money.”
As if school lunches weren’t bad enough under Michelle Obama. This is ridiculous…AND they reduced portion sizes. Kids come home starving because they don’t give enough food as it is. Now they get snack sizes because you want to serve tofu and vegetarian tostadas? Just because you say “delicious food” doesn’t make it so…

"In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.
You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.
Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.
Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.
This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.
Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.
4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way
Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.
Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",0
"A 15-a-side game invented and popularised in Ireland, hurling sees players use a wooden stick called a hurley to move a small ball, or sliotar, around the field.
You can catch the ball in your hand or scoop it up off the floor with your stick, and hit the ball with either the stick or your hand. You can also use the stick to block others.
To score, hit the ball between the opponents' goalposts - over the crossbar gets you one point, and into the net below the crossbar scores three.
Hurling prides itself on the fast pace of its action, so you will certainly burn calories, but the sport also rewards dexterity.
One of the skills, for example, is balancing the ball on the stick while running, and you will also develop good hand-eye coordination.
Ireland's Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) is the governing body for hurling. The GAA website website offers video guides to the game as well as places to play and contact details.
The Provincial Council of Britain GAA looks after hurling in England, Scotland and Wales and has details of clubs and events.
The GAA claims hurling was already a feature of Gaelic culture in Ireland as the last Ice Age was receding, with references to the game extending back thousands of years.
In the 19th Century the Irish Hurling Union and, later, the GAA produced the first sets of formalised rules.
Hurling has had only one, brief flirtation with Olympic status. At the 1904 St Louis Games, hurling was featured as a demonstration sport alongside basketball and baseball, both of which would later earn berths on the full Olympic programme.

"As we move from summer into autumn, fennel moves from the salad bowl to the cooking pot – with brilliantly mouthwatering results
As we move from summer into autumn, fennel moves from the salad bowl to the cooking pot – with brilliantly mouthwatering results
ate some fennel dumplings in Sicily last summer that knocked my socks off. I eat a lot of dumplings, wherever and whenever I can, so it’s rare to come across any that truly surprise me, but these somehow managed to showcase their main ingredients – the fennel, currants, parmesan and tomato that are so characteristic of Sicilian cooking – while having such a depth of flavour that I was sure something else had to be going on in there. At first I thought it must be some secret ingredient – was there a little mince in there, maybe? – but it turned out to be the way the fennel was cooked.
Eating, and cooking, as much as I do, at first I found my ignorance rather thrilling, but that soon turned to frustration when I tried to recreate those dumplings back home. I stayed none the wiser until I stumbled upon a blogpost that shone light on the subject: the trick, it turns out, is to cook the fennel until soft before mixing it with breadcrumbs (which do so much work behind the scenes in Sicilian kitchens). Cooking it right down turns fennel into something very different from the thin, raw slices we have in salads, and is just one way to show how this little bulb provides comfort and warmth as we move from one season to the next.
I call this a chutney, although, unlike most chutneys, you serve it straight away. It’s really versatile, working as well on a cheeseboard as alongside roast pork. It keeps in the fridge for up to a week. Makes one 600ml jar.
3 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp fennel seeds
2 small fennel bulbs, trimmed (300g net weight), cut in half lengthways, then widthways into 1-2mm-thick slices (use a mandoline, ideally)
2 onions, peeled and thinly sliced (300g net weight)
25g soft dark brown sugar
1 lemon, peel shaved off in 3 wide strips (avoid the bitter white pith)
2 tsp urfa chilli flakes (or 1 tsp if using another variety of chilli)
Salt
2 tbsp currants
3 tbsp white-wine vinegar
In large saucepan for which you have a lid, heat the oil on a medium flame, then toast the fennel seeds, stirring, for 30 seconds, until fragrant and starting to brown. Add the fennel, onion, sugar, lemon peel, half the chilli and half a teaspoon of salt, and fry for eight to nine minutes, stirring often, until the vegetables soften. Add the currants and 350ml water, turn the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 30 minutes, stirring now and then. Take off the lid and cook for 15 minutes, stirring often, until thick and glossy. Add the vinegar and remaining chilli, and cook for a final five minutes, stirring once or twice. Leave to cool before serving.
Use pot barley instead, if that’s all you have. Serves four.
2 medium fennel bulbs, green stems roughly chopped, bulbs cut lengthways into 6 wedges (650g net weight)
2 tbsp olive oil
Salt and black pepper
10g unsalted butter
2 banana shallots, peeled and finely chopped
5g thyme sprigs
 tsp fennel seeds, toasted and lightly crushed
170g black (or pot) barley, rinsed
80ml white wine
600ml vegetable stock
200g smoked haddock (undyed)
5g tarragon, roughly chopped
10g parsley, roughly chopped
1 lemon, cut into 4 wedges
Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. In a bowl, toss the fennel wedges with a tablespoon of oil, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Spread out on an oven tray lined with baking paper, and roast for 40 minutes, until soft and golden. Remove and keep somewhere warm.
Meanwhile, melt the butter and remaining tablespoon of oil in a large saute pan on a medium heat. Add the shallots, thyme, fennel stems and fennel seeds, and cook for five minutes, stirring a few times, until the shallots and fennel are soft. Stir through the barley and cook for a minute, to warm through. Add the wine, reduce for a minute, then add the stock, a half-teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Bring to a boil, turn the heat to medium-low and leave to simmer for 40 minutes (25 minutes for pot barley), until the barley is almost cooked.
Ten minutes before the barley is ready, fill a medium saucepan with 300ml water. Add the haddock, put the pan on a high heat and bring to a to boil. Immediately lift the fish out of the water and set aside. Pour 150ml of the fish water into the barley and cook for about 10 minutes, until most of the water has evaporated and the barley is cooked but still has a bite.
Stir the herbs into the barley. Break the fish into big chunks, discarding the skin, add to the barley and mix through very gently. Divide between four plates and arrange the warm fennel wedges on top. Serve with a wedge of lemon.
Make eight dumplings, to serve four as a first course.
For the dumplings
1 large fennel bulb, trimmed and cut into 0.5cm dice (400g net weight)
15g currants
20g pine nuts, roughly chopped
 tsp fennel seeds, lightly toasted and crushed
 tsp freshly ground nutmeg
2 slices sourdough, crusts removed and discarded, then blitzed to fine crumbs (80g net weight)
50g parmesan, finely grated
Finely grated zest of 2 lemons
2 eggs, beaten
30g dill, finely chopped
10g basil leaves, finely chopped
Salt and pepper
2 tbsp vegetable oil, to fry
For the sauce
1 tbsp olive oil, plus 1-2 tbsp extra, to serve
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
1 onion, peeled and cut into 0.5cm dice (150g net weight)
250g cherry tomatoes
180ml passata
 tbsp caster sugar
10g basil leaves, finely chopped, plus extra to garnish
Bring a medium pan of water to a boil, add the fennel and cook on medium-high heat for 15 minutes. Add the currants, cook for five minutes more, then strain through a fine sieve and leave to cool. Transfer the fennel and currants to a clean tea towel or muslin, squeeze out as much liquid as you can (if you don’t do this, the dumplings will be soggy and won’t hold their shape), then put in the fridge until cold.
Put all the remaining dumpling ingredients apart from the oil in a medium bowl with half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Mix well, then refrigerate.
For the sauce, in a large nonstick frying pan for which you have a lid heat the olive oil on a medium-high flame. Saute the garlic, onion and a quarter-teaspoon of salt for five minutes, stirring, until the onions are soft and golden, then add the cherry tomatoes and cook for three minutes, until they start to soften. Add the passata, sugar, basil, 180ml water and a generous grind of pepper. Stir to combine, turn down the heat to medium and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes, stirring a few times. (If the sauce starts to stick to the base of the pan, add a bit more water.) Remove the pan from the heat, leave to cool slightly, then transfer to a blender (if you don’t have a free-standing one, use with a hand-held stick blender). Process until the sauce is very smooth and velvety, then return it to the pan.
Now you’re ready to make the dumplings. Put the cooled fennel and currants in a bowl with the bread and egg mixture and, using your hands, form into eight round dumplings, each weighing about 50-60g. As you shape them, squeeze and compress the mixture as much as possible; this will help ensure that they don’t fall apart when cooking.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large nonstick frying pan on a medium heat. Once hot, add the dumplings and fry for seven to eight minutes in total, turning them over once or twice, so they colour all over, and very gently moving them around in the pan, so they don’t stick. Once the dumplings are crisp and golden all over, turn off the heat and, using a slotted spoon, carefully lower them into the pan with the tomato sauce. Gently turn the dumplings in the sauce, so that they’re all coated in it, then return the pan to a low-medium heat, cover, and leave to simmer for 15 minutes. Check the dumplings halfway through the cooking time: if the sauce is simmering or reducing too much, turn down the heat.
Serve the dumplings and sauce hot or warm, finishing them off with a drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of basil and a little salt and pepper.

"Our columnist’s search for the perfect clafoutis recipe comes by way of Transylvania – a golden beauty studded with greengage plums as velvety as they are verdant
Our columnist’s search for the perfect clafoutis recipe comes by way of Transylvania – a golden beauty studded with greengage plums as velvety as they are verdant
lums are the tribbles of the fruit world, so abundant are they. How could one ever forget the scene in Star Trek when Captain Kirk almost smiled – “Cute!” – as the USS Enterprise was overrun by these fuzzy little things.
Delightful in every way, plums have the same extraordinary ability to appear in such vast amounts that it is overwhelming.
I find that a reasonably straightforward way to chart a course through the sea of plums is to choose a green one. That said, there is only one green plum in relatively plentiful supply – the greengage – which seems brilliantly to resist commercial disaster. Not wishing to be unkind, the more commercial varieties of plums have an uncanny knack of never ripening, remaining firm, impossible to stone and, well, jam very badly.
The pudding this week is a greengage clafoutis, a classic dessert that adores any good variety of plum. Should fruit availability prove troublesome, fear not: a prune is also excellent here, as is a pear, perhaps poached, or lightly caramelised, even.
This seemingly simple recipe baffled me for many years, as I endlessly ended up with a leaden duffer of a pud, so much so that I quite gave up on it. It was at a lunch in Transylvania, quite literally, that my admiration for clafoutis was restored mightily. I had been flown to Cluj and driven to Turda on the Transylvanian plains, a historical region in Romania renowned for its beauty. The market in Turda had tables piled high with some of the finest, freshest produce I have ever seen for sale in a market.
One day, we journeyed for several hours to an ancient village called Copsa Mare. There we ate very well at the Copsa Mare Guesthouse. A good lunch was concluded with a beautiful pudding that was as close to being a clafoutis as can be – made with rhubarb.
How was this pudding made, I asked? The recipe kindly offered was from Simona Secju, the cook who had made it. As with recipes close to the heart of the cook, I could not capture the magic of this lovely pudding. It is so often time and place that defines a recipe.
But not long after I had returned home from this Carpathian adventure, I pulled a copy of Mastering The Art of French Cooking – by those good women Julia Child, Louisette Berthold and Simone Beck – from the shelf, to see whether the clafoutis recipe in their book might indeed be a distant cousin to what I had enjoyed at lunch in Transylvania.
The result was excellent! I smiled to myself that, like the Wizard of Oz story, it took a trip to Transylvania to make me find a recipe I had had all along; to make a pudding that made – at last – for happy memories.
Serves 6-8
250ml milk
80g caster sugar, reserve 30g for sprinkling at the end
3 eggs
1 vanilla pod
A pinch of salt
65g plain flour
500g greengages, mirabelles, or any firm dark plum like a Victoria (or best prunes, or even a poached pear), halved and stones removed
1 Heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas 3. Lightly butter a cast-iron frying pan or an earthenware dish near enough 25cm in diameter.
2 Put the milk, 50g caster sugar, eggs, vanilla pod, a pinch of salt and the flour, in the order listed, in a liquidiser. Cover and blend for 1 minute.
3 Pour the batter into the baking dish until it reaches a depth of 2cm. Put the dish over a moderate heat for 1-2 minutes, until a film of batter has set in the bottom of the dish.
4 Remove the dish from the heat. Dot the plum halves all over the batter, then sprinkle the remainng 30g of sugar over the top. Pour in the rest of the batter and smooth with the back of a spoon.
5 Put in the middle of the oven and bake for about an hour. The clafoutis is done when puffed and browned, and a knife or skewer plunged into its centre comes out clean. Best served warm, and requires only a little cream to accompany.

Is artificial intelligence ready for financial compliance?
This article was written by Daniel Fernandez for Traders Magazineand was licensed by Bloomberg.
Like many industry buzzwords,Artificial Intelligence (AI)has become a hot topic that RegTech technologists often write or speak about. But the reality is – AI has become an overloaded and misused term, often mistaken for Machine Learning (ML). This blog aims to clarify the difference between the two, explain some of the complexities of implementing these solutions today, and highlight how ML can immediately add value in financial compliance applications.
In simple terms, Artificial Intelligence enables computer systems to perform tasks that require human intelligence. Intelligence is the key word. In contrast, Machine Learning refers to a computer system that has the ability to learn how to do specific tasks, and in some instances can use past data to make future decisions or predictions without being explicitly “told” (programmed) how to do so. Machine Learning is a key building block of Artificial Intelligence.
AI and ML are often confused because the terms are used interchangeably. But they are not the same. Today, ML is used in many narrow compliance applications, including risk detection models, and other event classification use cases. A narrow ML application, however, does not constitute Artificial Intelligence in the context of compliance.
That said, a combination of systems and programs (based on ML) could constitute an Artificially Intelligent System, although no such systems truly exist in the compliance realm today.
Most artificially intelligent systems use a combination of machine learning applications and techniques along with rule-based systems (to be fully interactive). For example, phone-based smart assistant applications (such as Google Now, Siri, Cortana, and Alexa) use a set of application components which are mostly powered by machine learning. These include: language identification, translations, transcriptions, natural language understanding, etc. In these interactions you can perform tasks, such as booking a cab, where the following steps are performed behind the scenes:
Understand your command of requesting a car service and your destination;
Detect your location and determine your optimal pickup location;
Reach a nearby driver and agree with this driver on taking this trip;
Communicate back to you with an estimated fare for final confirmation.
Interacting with a smart assistant in this manner can be considered Artificial Intelligence because the smart assistant fully replaces a human (the taxi dispatcher), who would normally perform these tasks. Thus, human interaction is bypassed altogether.
While taxi dispatchers can be replaced by AI, the same cannot be said for compliance analysts. And this is a good thing, because while smart machines and complex algorithms can process a lot of data to automate and perform some human tasks, faster, there are limitations. For example, the current machine learning models and advanced statistical techniques can process far more messages, trades and records than humans can, but today humans are still needed to review, apply judgement and make decisions about what constitutes or does not constitute compliant communications. Why?
First, such decisions involve substantial operational and financial risk, and potential severe legal consequences and reputational damage. Secondly, true AI systems needto learn what is good (compliant) and bad (non-compliant) behavior and there simply aren’t enough instances of non-compliant communications in a firm’s data for an AI machine to learn this and make reliable decisions.
So when it comes to financial communications compliance, while technology can eliminate the time-consuming tasks entailing large data analysis, it is no substitute for the decision-making abilities of the compliance analyst, at least not today.
Adoption of ML technologies is accelerating across many industries (financial services firms included), thanks in large part to a renewed focus on applied problems and sharing of research findings. Still, one of the biggest challenges of ML remains unsolved. Machine learning relies on data.
Most advanced analytics projects devote a large portion of time to identifying and curating the necessary data to feed advanced algorithms. But are the analytics engines themselves flexible enough to handle all of these data inputs? In some cases the answer is ‘no,’ as some ML systems are constrained to accepting only certain types of data in certain types of formats.
This exact concern was highlighted in a recent report by Jeffries, a global investment banking firm. Theresearch reportfocused on issues related to IBM Watson. It highlighted an example of a health sciences project which required a significant amount of services and effort to integrate data sources from different systems, and did not produce the desired results.
According to the Jeffrey’s report, for example, MD Anderson has already spent over $60 million dollars in a Watson project and stated that “IBM is very ‘picky’ about the data it feeds Watson.” The project has since been halted because of the extensive integration that would have been required to make it work with MD Anderson’s systems.
As part of their normal course of business, financial Institutions already have to archive and analyze large amounts of data. By implication, ML platforms that rely on restrictive data inputs only make this problem worse. Financial institutions would need to store separate data in different formats in order to support advanced analytics models.
In communications compliance this becomes a much bigger problem due to the large variety of structured and unstructured data sources. Financial firms need to weigh the pros and cons – should I invest in a one-off ML project which requires custom integration, or layer ML on top of my existing surveillance solution? A lot of work already goes into making data useable for the surveillance process – why not leverage the data that your organization has already organized and curated for ML as well?
Either way, the expectation needs to be that ML is not intended to be self-sufficient. It needs to work hand-in-hand with a human compliance analyst, at least for today.
Fit for use is another challenge these projects face. This issue of the usability of the data was also highlighted in the MD Anderson/Watson audit. The report concluded that the Watson system was “not ready for human investigational or clinical use.”
Just having an ML system spit out results is not enough. You have to be able to integrate these results into the day-to-day supervision and investigative workflow of your compliance analysts, in a way that’s intuitive and contextual. This ensures that your ML is not just creating ‘more noise’ but instead providing useful information for decision-making.
The expanding role of Machine Learning in compliance
In today’s financial regulatory environment, numbers alone are not useful to compliance analysts. Consider, for example, under regulations such asMARandMiFID II(which will soon go into effect), it’s no longer sufficient to just monitor for actual fraudulent trading practices; firms also need to monitor communications for ‘intent to commit market abuse’ throughout a trade or transaction lifecycle. This necessitates obtaining additional context surrounding monitored users and their respective activities. This might include behavior anomalies, relationship discrepancies, or other fluctuations in communications or trade data.
The expectation for such analysis is also being driven by regulators such as the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) which has already started to incorporate these techniques into their daily compliance processes as well. Scott W. Bauguess (Acting Director and Acting Chief Economist DERA from the SEC) discussed this in a presentation at the OpRisk North America (in June 2017) when he said that the SEC uses “unsupervised algorithms to detect patterns and anomalies in the data, using nothing but the data.”
When it comes to financial communications compliance, Machine Learning technologies can truly improve the compliance process, but only if they fit into your firm’s current workflow. There’s no such thing as true AI in financial compliance (at least not yet) but ML can enhance your compliance team’s view of monitored users, help to detect financial communications compliance issues, and if implemented and applied correctly, facilitate analyst decision-making.",0

"We’ve heard it all: Fat is bad! Carbs are bad! Don’t have too much protein! Food myths are all over the internet but are rarely backed by facts. But should we be surprised? This is the same internet brimming with conspiracies like if the Beatles ever existed. (What?!) With your sanity in mind, we’ve taken care of nine of the most common food myths out there, so you can go back into the uncertainty of the internet knowing nine things for sure.
White bread, sugar, and the pasta all contain high amounts of highly refined sugar (also called simple carbohydrates) and seep into your blood stream quickly providing spikes of energy before sending you into an energy crash. The problem is that it’s hard to use so much energy quickly, unless you require large bursts of quick fuel, such as a long distance runner. Therefore, we need look for more complex carbohydrates (slow carbs) that take longer to digest to limit how quickly we absorb them. Eat vegetables, and whole grain bread to get the benefits of carbs responsibly.
The Bottom Line: You should eat carbs viawhole foods that are high in fiber.
Other popular oils like Canola and soybean oil are worse choices due to their processing methods and “inflammatory Omega-6 fatty acids.
The Bottom Line: Butter, olive oil, and some others are good for you when you use them correctly.
Eggs arescrutinized for being rich in cholesterol. However, one article from the Journal of the American College of Nutrition concludes that there’s no reason “a healthy eating pattern could not include eggs.” Additionally, nutrients and proteins like choline and heart-healthy Omega-3’s fill eggs.
Here’s a great article going over how cholesterol and heart disease are linked, and how egg consumption doesn’t necessarily lead to heart disease.
The Bottom Line: Eggs have a lot of benefits that outweigh the risks of high cholesterol for most people.
Gluten-free fad diets emerged as society’s opinion of gluten went awry. However, not everyone needs to stay away from evil gluten with a 10-ft pole — gluten-free diets are best for people with gluten allergies, sensitivities, or celiac disease. About 6 million American have celiac disease or a gluten allergy. These people need gluten-free diets as they experience legitimate symptoms. Other than these people, cutting simple carbs out of your life is enough to lose weight not gluten entirely.
The Bottom Line: Most of us could remove white bread from our diet, but not everyone is sensitive to gluten.
Juicers mix simplicity, great taste, and nutrition all into one drink. However, the practice might not be so healthy after all. When dealing with the high sugar content in fruit, it’s important to avoid only fruit-based juices and to eat fiber to slow down the pace at which we absorb them. Blending a combination of fruits and vegetables boost fiber and nutrients.
However, juicing can be beneficial because it provides nutrients from foods we may not eat alone.
The Bottom Line: Eating whole fruits and veggies is always better, but juicing can be a way to sneak in extra vitamins for those who struggle to eat enough fresh produce habitually.
The American food guide suggests drinking three cups of milk a day; some say this is too much. Milk provides calcium and vitamin D for strong bones, along with potassium. However, there are better alternatives like vegetables which contain calcium and vitamin D. While America’s sodium to potassium imbalance can also be corrected by eating less processed foods and eating fruits like bananas.
Milk is also high in calories with about 138 in each glass. Milk’s D-galactose has also been shown as a proinflammatory. Therefore, eating another dairy such as cheese and yogurt with less D-galactose can also replace the benefits of milk.
The Bottom Line: Try to avoid or limit milk, there are better options.
Thinking about how you eat at each meal is crucial. One study in the journal Obesity found that women who ate more calories in the morning than at night lost more weight than those who did the opposite.
Additionally, a study in mice found that when they ate high-fat food during their active hours, they only added 20 percent of their body weight, while mice who ate during inactive hours added 48 percent of their body weight.
The Bottom Line: The type and amount of food you eat at a particular time influences your body — find an eating schedule that your body agrees with.
While foods like celery have few calories, it is impossible to have less than zero calories. Digesting food burns calories but it’s minimal, and the loss wouldn’t be enough to be a method of dieting.If you are looking to make calories “disappear” workout!
The Bottom Line: Don’t try eating your way to weight loss. Instead, eat good food and exercise.
Microwaves can denature enzymes which are good for digestion. HOWEVER, foods lose nutrients to many cooking methods, including barbecues and stoves. The quick-cooking microwave might even save more nutrients than these more formal methods. Steaming vegetable with a little water is the best way to get the most out of microwaved veggies.
The Bottom Line: Microwaves aren’t the most delicious way to cook, they ruin the texture and taste of a lot of food, but they do not kill as many nutrients as conventional ways of cooking.
Knowing the truth about food isn’t always easy, and understanding the nuances of each food item in the grocery store is time-consuming. However, whole foods eaten in moderation is a good general rule to follow if you are unsure.",1
"Researchers across the world are racing towards a cure for Alzheimer’s disease. But as prevalence rates climb, their focus has broadened from treatment to prevention strategies. What they’ve discovered is that it may be possible to prevent or delay the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias through a combination of healthy habits.
Fears about Alzheimer’s may discourage you from taking action. But by identifying and controlling your personal risk factors, you can maximize your chances of lifelong brain health and take effective steps to preserve your cognitive abilities.
Alzheimer’s is a complex disease with multiple risk factors. Some, like your age and genetics, are outside your control. But many others are within your sphere of influence. And these factors can be quite powerful when it comes to your brain health.
The six pillars of a brain-healthy, Alzheimer’s prevention lifestyle are:
The more you strengthen each of the six pillars in your daily life, the healthier and hardier your brain will be. When you lead a brain-healthy lifestyle, your brain will stay working stronger… longer.
According to the Alzheimer’s Research & Prevention Foundation, regular physical exercise can reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease by up to 50 percent. What’s more, exercise can also slow further deterioration in those who have already started to develop cognitive problems. Research suggests that exercise protects against Alzheimer’s by stimulating the brain’s ability to maintain old connections as well as make new ones.
To maximize the brain-protecting benefits of your workout:
Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week.The ideal plan involves a combination of cardio exercise and strength training, but anything that gets your heart rate up is a good place to start. Good activities for beginners include walking and swimming. But even routine activities such as cleaning and gardening can count as exercise as long as they get you up and moving.
Build muscle to pump up your brain.Moderate levels of weight and resistance training not only increase muscle mass, they help you maintain brain health. Combining aerobics and strength training is better than either activity alone. For those over 65, adding 2-3 strength sessions to your weekly routine may cut your risk of Alzheimer’s in half.
Include balance and coordination exercises.Head injuries from falls are an increasing risk as you grow older, which in turn increase your risk for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Balance and coordination exercises can help you stay agile and avoid spills. Try yoga, Tai Chi, or exercises using balance discs or balance balls.
Tips for starting and sticking with your exercise plan
Studies suggest that head trauma at any point in life significantly increases your risk of Alzheimer’s disease. This includes repeated hits in sports activities such as football, soccer, and boxing, or one-time injuries from a bicycle, skating, or motorcycle accident. Protect your brain by wearing properly fitting sports helmets, buckling your seatbelt, and trip-proofing your environment. Avoid activities that compete for your attention—like talking on your cell while driving. A moment’s distraction can lead to a brain-injuring thud!
If you’ve been inactive for a while, starting an exercise program can be intimidating. But you don’t have to take up jogging or sign up for a gym membership. Look for small ways to add more movement into your day. Park at the far end of the parking lot, take the stairs, carry your own groceries, or walk around the block or pace while talking on your cell phone.
And remember, it takes approximately 28 days for a new routine to become habit, so do your best to stick with it for a month. Once you’re over this hump, keeping up your exercise routine will feel natural. In the meantime, write realistic goals on a workout calendar and post it on the fridge. Build in frequent rewards, and within no time, the feel-good endorphins from regular exercise will help you forget the remote…and head out the door.
In Alzheimer’s disease, inflammation and insulin resistance injure neurons and inhibit communication between brain cells.Alzheimer’s is sometimes described as “diabetes of the brain,” and a growing body of information suggests a strong link between metabolic disorders and the signal processing systems. Eating habits that reduce inflammation and promote normal energy production are brain-healthy. These food tips will keep you protected:
Enjoy a Mediterranean diet.Several epidemiological studies show that eating a Mediterranean dietdramatically reduces the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. That means plenty of vegetables, beans, whole grains, fish, and olive oil—and limited dairy and meat.
Eat to protect glial cells. Researchers believe that glial cells may help remove debris and toxins from the brain that can contribute to Alzheimer’s disease. Consuming foods such as ginger, green tea, fatty fish, soy products, blueberries, and other dark berries may protect these important cells from damage.
Avoid trans fats and saturated fats.These fats can cause inflammation and produce free radicals—both of which are hard on the brain. Reduce your consumption by avoiding full-fat dairy products, red meat, fast food, fried foods, and packaged and processed foods. Watch out for trans fats on labels, where they are listed as “partially hydrogenated oils.” To reduce Alzheimer’s risk, focus on healthy fats.
Get plenty of omega-3 fats.Evidence suggests that the DHA found in omega-3 fatty acids may help prevent Alzheimer’s disease and dementia by reducing beta-amyloid plaques. Food sources include cold-water fish such as salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, and sardines. You can also supplement with fish oil.
Stock up on fruit and vegetables.When it comes to fruits and vegetables, the more the better. Eat up across the color spectrum to maximize protective antioxidants and vitamins. Superfoods to emphasize include green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, and berries.
Maintain consistent levels of insulin and blood sugar.Eat several small meals throughout the day. Avoid packaged, refined, and processed foods, especially those high in refined carbs such as sugars and white flour, which rapidly spike glucose levels and inflame your brain.
Enjoy daily cups of tea.Regular consumption of green tea may enhance memory and mental alertness and slow brain aging. White and oolong teas are also particularly brain healthy. Drinking 2-4 cups daily has proven benefits. Although not as powerful as tea, coffee also confers brain benefits.
Folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin D, magnesium, and fish oil are believed to preserve and improve brain health. Studies of vitamin E, ginkgo biloba, coenzyme Q10, and turmeric have yielded less conclusive results, but may also be beneficial in the prevention or delay of Alzheimer’s and dementia symptoms.
Talk to your doctor about medication interactions, and review current literature to make a personal decision about the costs and benefits of dietary supplements.
Those who continue learning new things throughout life and challenging their brains are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, so make it a point to stay mentally active. In essence, you need to “use it or lose it.”
Activities involving multiple tasks or requiring communication, interaction, and organization offer the greatest protection. Set aside time each day to stimulate your brain. Cross-training with these brain-boosting activities will help keep you mentally sharp:
Learn something new.Study a foreign language, learn sign language, practice a musical instrument, read the newspaper or a good book, or take up a new hobby. The greater the novelty and challenge, the larger the deposit in your brain reserves.
Practice memorization.Start with something short, progressing to something a little more involved, such as the 50 U. S. state capitals. Create rhymes and patterns to strengthen your memory connections.
Enjoy strategy games, puzzles, and riddles.Brain teasers and strategy games provide a great mental workout and build your capacity to form and retain cognitive associations. Do a crossword puzzle, play board games or cards, or work word and number games, such as Scrabble or Sudoku.
Practice the 5 W’s.Observe and report like a crime detective. Keep a “Who, What, Where, When, and Why” list of your daily experiences. Capturing visual details keeps your neurons firing.
Follow the road less traveled.Take a new route, eat with your non-dominant hand, rearrange your computer file system. Vary your habits regularly to create new brain pathways.
In a groundbreaking study, older adults who received as few as 10 sessions of mental training not only improved their cognitive functioning in daily activities in the months after the training, but continued to show long-lasting improvements 10 years later.
The ACTIVE study of 2,832 seniors involved 60-75 minute training sessions in memory, reasoning, or speed of processing, using exercises such as memorizing lists, detecting patterns in number series, and operating a touch-screen program.
Ten years after the training, nearly three-quarters of the participants who received reasoning training and over 70 percent of speed-trained participants were still performing tasks above their pre-trial baseline level, compared to about 62 and 49 percent of control participants.
While there was not the same improvement in memory performance, the results highlight the importance of mental training in delaying the onset of functional symptoms of dementia.
It’s common for people with Alzheimer’s disease to suffer from insomnia and other sleep problems. But new research suggests that disrupted sleep isn’t just a symptom of Alzheimer’s, but a possible risk factor. An increasing number of studies have linked poor sleep to higher levels of beta-amyloid, a sticky brain-clogging protein that in turn further interferes with sleep—especially with the deep sleep necessary for memory formation. Other studies emphasize the importance of uninterrupted sleep for flushing out brain toxins.
If nightly sleep deprivation is slowing your thinking and affecting your mood, you may be at greater risk of developing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The vast majority of adults need at least 8 hours of sleep per night. Any less, and productivity and creativity suffers.
Tips to improve the quality of your sleep
Get screened for sleep apnea. If you’ve received complaints about your snoring, you may want to get tested for sleep apnea, a potentially dangerous condition where breathing is disrupted during sleep. Treatment can make a huge difference in both your health and sleep quality.
Establish a regular sleep schedule.Going to bed and getting up at the same time reinforces your natural circadian rhythms. Your brain’s clock responds to regularity.
Be smart about napping.While taking a nap can be a great way to recharge, especially for older adults, it can make insomnia worse. If insomnia is a problem for you, consider eliminating napping. If you must nap, do it in the early afternoon, and limit it to thirty minutes.
Set the mood.Reserve your bed for sleep and sex, and ban television and computers from the bedroom (both are stimulating and may lead to difficulties falling asleep).
Create a relaxing bedtime ritual.Take a hot bath, do some light stretches, write in your journal, or dim the lights. As it becomes habit, your nightly ritual will send a powerful signal to your brain that it’s time for deep restorative sleep.
Quiet your inner chatter.When stress, anxiety, or negative internal dialogues keep you awake, get out of bed. Try reading or relaxing in another room for twenty minutes then hop back in.
Stress that is chronic or severe takes a heavy toll on the brain, leading to shrinkage in a key memory area of the brain known as the hippocampus, hampering nerve cell growth, and increasing your risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Yet simple daily tools can minimize its harmful effects.
Get your stress levels in check with these proven techniques
Breathe!Stress alters your breathing rate and impacts oxygen levels in the brain. Quiet your stress response with deep, abdominal breathing. Restorative breathing is powerful, simple, and free!
Schedule daily relaxation activities.Keeping stress under control requires regular effort. Make relaxation a priority, whether it’s a walk in the park, playtime with your dog, yoga, or a soothing bath.
Nourish inner peace.Most scientists acknowledge a strong mind-body connection, and various studies associate spirituality with better brain health. Regular meditation, prayer, reflection, and religious practice may immunize you against the damaging effects of stress.
Make fun a priority.All work and no play is not goof for your stress levels or your brain. Make time for leisure activities that bring you joy, whether it be stargazing, playing the piano, or working on your bike.
Keep your sense of humor.This includes the ability to laugh at yourself. The act of laughing helps your body fight stress in a number of ways.
Human beings are highly social creatures. We don’t thrive in isolation, and neither do our brains. Studies show that the more connected we are, the better we fare on tests of memory and cognition. Research shows that staying socially engaged may even protect against Alzheimer’s disease and dementia in later life, so make developing and maintaining a strong network of friends a priority. Keep in mind that you don’t need to be a social butterfly to get brain benefits. When it comes to socializing, think quality, not quantity. In-person, face-to-face interaction is always best.
Oftentimes, we become more isolated as we get older, but there are many ways to keep your support system strong anddevelop new friendships:
Take group classes (such as at the gym or a community college)
Reach out over the phone or email
Connect to others via social networks such as Facebook
Get to know your neighbors
Get out (go to the movies, the park, museums, and other public places)
Simple ways to connect with your partner, family member, or friend
Commit to spending quality time together on a regular basis. Even during very busy and stressful times, a few minutes of really sharing and connecting can help keep bonds strong.
Find something that you enjoy doing together, whether it is a shared hobby, dance class, daily walk, or sitting over a cup of coffee in the morning.
Try something new together. Doing new things together can be a fun way to connect and keep things interesting. It can be as simple as trying a new restaurant or going on a day trip to a place you’ve never been before.
There’s less of a separation between brain and body than you might think. As demonstrated above, what’s good for the body—like sleep, exercise, and nutritious food—is also good for the brain. And that also means that the converse is true: things that are bad for the body are also damaging to the brain.
Stop smoking. Smoking is one of the most preventable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease. A significant meta-study found that smokers over the age of 65 have a nearly 80% higher risk of Alzheimer’s than those who have never smoked. When you stop smoking, the brain benefits from improved circulation almost immediately, no matter your age.
Get your blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control. Both high blood pressure and high total cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of both Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. Improving those numbers are good for the brain as well as the heart.
Watch your weight. Extra pounds are a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia. A 30+ year study of over 10,000 people found that people who were overweight in midlife were twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s down the line, and those who were obese had three times the risk. Losing weight now can go a long way to protecting your brain later.
Drink only in moderation. Despite the hype over the brain benefits of red wine, the evidence is limited. What’s clear is that even moderately heavy alcohol consumption dramatically raises the risk of Alzheimer’s and accelerates brain aging.
Keep your brain healthy, sharp, and reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s with these scientifically-proven strategies
When I was 14 years old, my grandfather died of Alzheimer’s disease. I remember the years leading up to his death and how quickly his mind wore away.
A population-based cohort study of 1,836 older Japanese-Americans found that consumption of fruit and vegetable juices was associated with decreased incidence of Alzheimer’s over seven to nine years of follow-up.
Berries contain high levels of biologically active components, including a class of compounds called anthocyanosides, which fight memory impairment associated with free radicals and beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Eat berries each day for maximum benefit.
In the Framingham study, individuals with the top quartile levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) found in fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and tuna, measured at baseline had lower rates of Alzheimer’s over nine years of follow-up. These fish are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids.
If you don’t take a supplement, eat foods high in folate. High levels of homocysteine may be associated with poor cognitive function. Some findings indicate that reducing homocysteine with folic acid may increase cognitive function. (What other supplements do you need?
Drink a glass of red wine or purple grape juice with your evening meal. Components in grape skins protect brain cells from the toxic effect of oxidative stress and beta amyloid.
Two studies that used dietary questionnaires to assess and quantify adherence to the diet in different populations found that patients who were most adherent to the Mediterranean style diet had a lower incidence of Alzheimer’s, compared with those who did not follow this diet.
Hypertension appears to be associated with an increased risk of both vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
Findings indicate that an active social life and strong network of friends may help prevent Alzheimer’s in later life.
I’d accompany my father to the hospital and be shocked to watch my grandfather drinking imaginary tea from an imaginary tea cup, talking to himself, and not recognizing his son at all.
I don’t have many memories from my childhood but these are definitely some of the worst.
I watch my 3 year-old whose memory is utterly fantastic, not clouded at all by all of the toxins and pollutants that have begun to fog my own brain. And as I watch her, I cannot imagine not knowing who she is 30 or 40 years from now.
Alzheimer’s and dementia are some of the scariest and most emotionally-triggering degenerative diseases. But they are easier to prevent than previously thought.
If you have a family history of one of these diseases or are worried about what they may do to you as you age, one of the first things you can do is modify your diet.
Here are 10 foods you should add into your diet that can help improve your mind:
Leafy greens.Some ideas:kale, spinach, collard and mustard greens. These foods are high in folate and B9, which improve cognition and reduce depression.
Cruciferous vegetables.Broccoli, cauliflower, bok choy, brussels sprouts and kale contain folate and have carotenoids that lower homo-cysteine (an amino acid linked with cognitive impairment).
Beans and legumes.These foods contain more folate, iron, magnesium and potassium that can help with general body function and neuron firing. They also contain choline, a B vitamin that boosts acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter critical for brain function).
Researchers say there are certain lifestyle measures we can take to reduce our risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, including being physically active, eating a healthy and balanced diet, maintaining good cardiovascular health, and exercising the brain.
The Alzheimer’s association says we need more scientifically based large-scale studies to back up some of the proposed measures, but research so far has been promising.
The incidence of dementia, including Alzheimer’s is expected to grow as lifespans increase. A study carried out by the RAND Corporation and published in NEJM (New England Journal of Medicine) (April 2013 issue) reported that the economic burden of dementia in the USA could double by 2040. This rising rate of dementia and Alzheimer’s has fuelled efforts to find prevention strategies.
Experts from the University of California, San Francisco, said that over 50% of all Alzheimer’s cases may be prevented through lifestyle changes. This involves reducing important risk factors, including:
* properly treating or preventing chronic diseases and conditions, such as hypertension (high blood pressure), high blood cholesterol, diabetes, obesity in mid life, and depression.
Canadian expert, Dr. Kenneth Rockwood of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, explained in the journalNeurology that if you pay attention to health factors not traditionally linked to dementia, such as vision, hearing, or how well dentures fit, you may also reduce the risk of developing dementia.
Several studies have shown that the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia is higher among people who have diseases and conditions that damage cardiovascular health, i.e. the health of the blood vessels and the heart. Examples include hypertension (high blood pressure), atrial fibrillation, high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and high cholesterol. We know that bad heart habits reduce brain volume.
Experts are not sure why some patients with the hallmark Alzheimer’s plaques and tangles never developed Alzheimer’s symptoms while they were alive. Perhaps in these cases symptoms only appear if the patient also has some kind of vascular disease.
If this is the case, and most experts believe it probably is, controlling cardiovascular risk factors could be one of the best ways to protect patients from developing Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.
High cholesterol raises Alzheimer’s risk – a team led by Kensuke Sasaki, MD, PhD, from Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, demonstrated a close association between high cholesterol levels and senile plaques, which are common among people with Alzheimer’s disease. The study was published in Neurology (September 2011 issue).
Women with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop dementia, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco reported in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association).
Metabolic syndrome refers to a cluster of conditions, including obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar levels – they all occur simultaneously and increase the risk of stroke, heart disease and diabetes.
Metabolic syndrome can be treated with good diet, exercise, weight loss and some medications. People with metabolic syndrome who are able to reach their ideal weight, bring down their blood pressure and cholesterol to healthy levels, and control their blood sugar will not only reduce their risk of diabetes and cardiovascular events, but also dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
Obesity in old age undermines male cognitive function – a study of 3,000 elderly men and women found an association between obesity and poorer thinking and memory skills among the obese males, but not the females.
Obesity in middle age raises dementia risk later on – Dr Annette L Fitzpatrick of the University of Washington, Seattle, found that 75 year-old people who were obese when they were 50 had a higher chance of developing dementia. However, they also found that being underweight when elderly increased the likelihood of dementia.
Diabetes considerably increases risk of dementia – diabetes is a risk factor for dementia, researchers from Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, reported in the journal Neurology (September 2011 issue).
Senior author, Yutaka Kiyohara, MD, PhD, said “Our findings emphasize the need to consider diabetes as a potential risk factor for dementia. Diabetes is a common disorder, and the number of people with it has been growing in recent years all over the world. Controlling diabetes is now more important than ever.”
The team found that patients with diabetes had double the risk of developing Alzheimer’s and other dementias, including vascular dementia. Other studies suggested that patients with the best diabetes control had the lowest risk of dementia. If you have diabetes and wish to minimize your risk, follow your treatment regimen carefully. However, one study suggested that intensive blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes does not slow cognitive decline.
Researchers have found that a healthy and well balanced diet helps brain health because of its impact on heart health. A healthy heart provides the brain with plenty of oxygen-rich blood. A study published in Neuron found thatheart disease risk scores are closely linked to the likelihood of cognitive decline.
The Mediterranean diet protects aging brains – a diet which includes olive oil as the main source of fat, plus plenty of fruits, vegetables, pulses (legumes), a moderate-to-high amount of fish/seafood, low quantity of dairy products and red meat, and moderate amounts of wine has been shown to protect older people at risk of vascular dementia, scientists from the University of Navarra, Spain, reported. Vascular dementia occurs when blood vessels which provide the brain with oxygen are damaged – the brain becomes deprived of oxygen.
Their study was published in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry (May 2013 issue). The authors added that the Mediterranean diet appears to be more effective in protecting the brain health of seniors compared to a low-fat diet, which is typically recommended for stroke and heart attack patients.
Eating too much bad for memory in seniors – researchers from the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, showed that people over 70 years of age who ate in excess of 2,100 calories per day almost doubled their risk of mild cognitive impairment. Study author Yonas E. Geda, MD, MSc, said “We observed a dose-response pattern which simply means; the higher the amount of calories consumed each day, the higher the risk of MCI.”
Diets high in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins C, B, D, E improve mental ability – a study carried out by a team at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland demonstrated. Dr. Gene Bowman and colleagues also found that diets high in trans fats were more likely to encourage brain shrinkage.
Eating fish once a week reduces risk of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment – the researchers, from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, said that those who ate baked or broiled fish at least once a week “had better preservation of gray matter volume on MRI in brain areas at risk for Alzheimer’s disease.”
In this video below, Carl W. Cotman, Ph. D., explains how a diet rich in antioxidants and regular exercise may benefit the brain.
Being physically fit and doing regular exercise will most likely lower the risk of developing vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, experts say. This could be for a number of reasons, including a better blood and oxygen supply to the brain. Exercise protects cardiovascular health, which is known to reduce the risk of dementia.
A research team from The Cooper Institute, Dallas, Texas, reported in Annals of Internal Medicine (February 2013 issue) that people who are fit and exercise regularly during middle age are less likely to develop dementia later on.
Team leader, Laura F. DeFina, MD, said “Higher midlife fitness levels seem to be associated with lower hazards of developing all-cause dementia later in life. The magnitude and direction of the association were similar with or without previous stroke, suggesting that higher fitness levels earlier in life may lower risk for dementia later in life, independent of cerebrovascular disease.”
Even a brief spurt of intense exercise boosts memory among both mentally “healthy” seniors as well as those with slight cognitive impairment, scientists from UC Irvine’s Center for the Neurobiology of Learning & Memory reported.
As humans enter late adulthood, the brain’s hippocampus starts to shrink, this leads to loss of memory and a higher risk of dementia. A team from the University of Illinois and Rice University found that just 12 months of moderate physical exercises can reverse shrinkage of the hippocampus and improve spatial memory. Their study was published in PNAS (January 2011 issue).
The hippocampus is part of the limbic system and sits deep with brain tissue; it plays an important role in several types of memory formation and spatial navigation.
Could exercise be more important than diet for preventing dementia? – Ayae Kinoshita and colleagues at the Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan, suggest that exercise alone may be as effective in reducing β-amyloid formation (a defining characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease) as exercise plus diet. Kinoshita suggested that “Based on the results in this research, exercise should be given priority to prevent Alzheimer’s disease.”
Even if you start late, exercise can protect from Alzheimer’s – even if you start exercising after the age of 80 years, your risk of developing Alzheimer’s will probably go down, researchers from Rush University Medical Center reported in Neurology (April 2012 issue).
Lead author, Dr. Aron S. Buchman, said “The results of our study indicate that all physical activities including exercise as well as other activities such as cooking, washing the dishes, and cleaning are associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease. These results provide support for efforts to encourage all types of physical activity even in very old adults who might not be able to participate in formal exercise, but can still benefit from a more active lifestyle. This is the first study to use an objective measurement of physical activity in addition to self-reporting. This is important because people may not be able to remember the details correctly.”
Exercising during pregnancy protects baby from Alzheimer’s later on – the offspring of mothers who exercised during pregnancy are less likely to develop neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, later on in life, scientists from University Hospital Esse, Germany, reported in The FASEB Journal.
Team member, Kathy Keyvani, M. D., said “This research provides an experimental rationale for the effects of beneficial behavioral stimuli experienced by the pregnant mother affecting the disease status of an as yet-unborn child.
“Epigenetic alterations (alterations in gene and protein expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence) provide a most probable mechanism by which mothers could have transferred their own behavioral experience to their progeny. A better understanding of the underlying pathways may provide novel treatment and/or prevention strategies for Alzheimer’s disease and bring more insight into the fascinating link between brain and behavior.”
Aerobic exercises cut dementia risk and also slow down its progress once it starts – according to a study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings (September 2011 issue). Lead researcher, Dr J Eric Ahlskog explained that aerobic exercise is not just a gym workout, but includes walking, doing household chores, as well as raking leaves and shoveling snow.
Dr. Ahlskog said “We concluded that you can make a very compelling argument for exercise as a disease-modifying strategy to prevent dementia and mild cognitive impairment, and for favorably modifying these processes once they have developed.”
Several studies suggest that the risk of cognitive decline is much lower if the brain is kept mentally active and people maintain strong social connections.
Retiring later reduces the risk of dementia – a team from the Bordeaux School of Public Health, France, found that the chances of being diagnosed with dementia went down for each year a person postponed retiring. The study found that employees who retired at the age of 65 were 14% less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s compared to those who retired when they were 60.
Study leader, Carole Dufouil said “Our data show strong evidence of a significant decrease in the risk of developing dementia associated with older age at retirement, in line with the ‘use it or lose it’ hypothesis. The patterns were even stronger when we focused on more recent birth cohorts.”
Writing, reading and engaging in brain-stimulating activities help preserve memory in old age, neurologists from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago wrote in Neurology (July 2013 issue). Senior author, Robert S. Wilson, PhD, explained that people who regularly took part in activities that exercised their brain had better results in tests that measured thinking and memory.
Dr. Wilson said “Exercising your brain by taking part in activities such as these across a person’s lifetime, from childhood through old age, is important for brain health in old age.”
Keeping the brain active reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer’s – a team led by Susan M. Landau, Ph. D., at the University of California in Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, reported in Archives of Neurology (January 2012 issue) that individuals who keep their brains active throughout their lives have lower levels of the the β-amyloid protein. The β-amyloid protein plays a major role in amyloid plaque buildup in Alzheimer’s disease.
Being bilingual delays onset of Alzheimer’s – if you speak two languages fluently, you will need to suffer twice as much brain damage before Alzheimer’s symptoms start to appear, compared to people who speak only one language, rsearchers from St. Michael’s Hospital, Canada, reported in the journal Cortex (October 2011 issue).
Study leader, Dr. Tom Schweizer, explained that bilingualism beats by far any medications in delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s symptoms.
Mental exercise wards off dementia – anything that gets the mind and brain working can help protect from dementia, researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York found. Neurologist Joe Verghese suggested people play musical instruments, play chess, bridge, or get involved in anything that stimulates cognition.
Dr. Verghese emphasized that it is never too late to start. The team found that mentally active seniors could reduce their risk of developing dementia by up to 75%, compared to people who do not regularly challenge their minds.
In this video below, Teepa Snow, MS, OTR/L, FAOTA, talks about using your brain to reduce dementia risk.
Often overlooked, getting plenty of good quality sleep can help significantly in protecting from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. In today’s high speed world, sleep deprivation has become a growing problem for hundreds of millions of people.
In a presentation by Yo-El Ju, M. D., from the University School of Medicine, St. Louis, done at the American Academy of Neurology’s 64th Annual Meeting in New Orleans (February 2012), he explained that the amount of sleep people get may later influence memory function and Alzheimer’s risk.
Dr. Ju said “Disrupted sleep appears to be associated with the build-up of amyloid plaques, a hallmark marker of Alzheimer’s disease, in the brains of people without memory problems. Further research is needed to determine why this is happening and whether sleep changes may predict cognitive decline.”
Dr. Ju and team found that people who did not wake up often during the night were five times less likely to have amyloid plaque build-up compared to those who did not sleep well. Amyloid plaque accumulation predicts future Alzheimer’s.
Dr. Ju added “The association between disrupted sleep and amyloid plaques is intriguing, but the information from this study can’t determine a cause-effect relationship or the direction of this relationship. We need longer-term studies, following individuals’ sleep over years, to determine whether disrupted sleep leads to amyloid plaques, or whether brain changes in early Alzheimer’s disease lead to changes in sleep. Our study lays the groundwork for investigating whether manipulating sleep is a possible strategy in the prevention or slowing of Alzheimer’s disease”
The association between smoking, nicotine and cognitive decline has been shown in some studies, but contradicted in others. As already mentioned above, all risk factors for stroke and heart disease also raise the risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Smoking raises the risk of heart disease and stroke, so it should logically also be more likely that a regular smoker develops dementia.
A study conducted at University College London and published in Archives of General Psychiatry (February 2012) demonstrated that regular male smokers are more likely to experience faster cognitive decline compared to lifetime non-smoking men. The authors added that smoking is becoming more and more accepted in the scientific community as a risk factor for dementia among seniors.
Séverine Sabia, Ph. D., and colleagues assessed the association between smoking history and cognitive decline during the transition period from midlife to old age. They gathered and analyzed data on 5,099 males and 2,137 females from the Whitehall II cohort, a health database of employees in the British Civil Service.
Dr. Sabia concluded “Our results show that the association between smoking and cognition, particularly at older ages, is likely to be underestimated owing to higher risk of death and dropout among smokers.”
The team was surprised to find no link between regular smoking and cognitive decline in females.
Heavy smoking raises Alzheimer’s risk by 157% and vascular dementia by 172%, a study carried out by experts at Kaiser Permanente and published in Archives of Internal Medicine (October 2010) found. The authors emphasized that the “heavy smoking” relates to when it occurs in midlife.
Lead researcher, Rachel A. Whitmer, Ph. D., said “This study shows that the brain is not immune to the long-term consequences of heavy smoking. We know smoking compromises the vascular system by affecting blood pressure and elevates blood clotting factors, and we know vascular health plays a role in risk of Alzheimer’s disease.”
Nicotine patches help patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) – scientists from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville found that older patients with MCI showed improvements in cognition when given nicotine patches.
Study leader, Paul Newhouse, MD, said “People with mild memory loss should not start smoking or using nicotine patches by themselves, because there are harmful effects of smoking and a medication such as nicotine should only be used with a doctor’s supervision. But this study provides strong justification for further research into the use of nicotine for people with early signs of memory loss.
We do not know whether benefits persist over long periods of time and provide meaningful improvement.”",1
"BOTH financiers and economists still get the blame for the 2007-2009 financial crisis: the first group for causing it and the second for not predicting it. As it turns out, the two issues are connected. The economists failed to understand the importance of finance and financiers put too much faith in the models produced by economists.
If this seems like an ancient debate, and thus irrelevant to today's concerns, it is not. The response of central banks and regulators to the crisis has led to an economy unlike any we have seen before, with short-term rates at zero, some bond yields at negative rates and central banks playing a dominant role in the markets. It is far from clear that either economics or financial theory have adjusted to face this new reality.
The best hope for progress is the school of behavioural economics, which understands that individuals cannot be the rational actors who fit neatly into academic models. More economists are accepting that finance is not a “zero sum game”, nor indeed a mere utility, but an important driver of economic cycles. Indeed, finance has become too dominant a driver.
In this year’s presidential address to the American Financial Association, Luigi Zingales asked “Does Finance Benefit Society?”. He concluded that “at the current state of knowledge there is no theoretical reason to support the notion that all the growth of the financial sector in the last 40 years has been beneficial to society”. And a recent paper from the Bank of International Settlements, the central bankers’ central bank, concluded that “the level of financial development is good only up to a point, after which it becomes a drag on growth”.
Note that these objections are not the same as the argument, familiar from the crisis, that individual banks are too big to fail (or TBTF). This approach is more akin to the idea of the “resource curse” that economies with an excessive exposure to a commodity, such as oil, may become imbalanced. Just as the easy money from drilling for oil may make an economy slow to develop alternative business sectors, the easy money from trading in assets, and lending against property, may distort a developed economy.
This is where academic theory comes in. The finance sector damages the economy because it does not function as well as the models contend. Asset bubbles can and do form. Buyers of debt fail to prudently assess whether the borrowers can repay. The incentives that govern the actions of financial sector employees tend to reward speculation, rather than long-term wealth creation. Some of this is to do with the way that governments have regulated the financial system. But much of it is to do with the psychological foibles that make us human.
These foibles are not recognised in traditional models which assume that humans are rational beings or homo economicus. In his new book “Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioural Economics”, Richard Thaler uses a different term: econs. He writes that “compared to this fictional world of econs, humans do a lot of misbehaving, and that means that economic models make a lot of bad predictions.”
Of course, the behavioural economics school has been around for 40 years or so. But for much of this time, its conclusions were dismissed by mainstream economists as a set of lab studies, amusing as anecdotes but impractical as explanations for the behaviour of an entire economy.
Never mind the theory, look at the practice
Traditional finance theories still hold sway in academia because they look good in textbooks; they are based on mathematical formulae that can be easily adapted to analyse any trend in the markets. “Theorists like models with order, harmony and beauty” says Robert Shiller of Yale, who won the Nobel prize for economics in 2013. “Academics like ideas that will lead to econometric studies.” By contrast, economists who speak of the influence of behaviour on markets have to use fuzzier language, and this can seem unconvincing. “People in ambiguous situations will focus on the person who has the most coherent model” adds Mr Shiller.
Nevertheless, behavioural economists argue that their mainstream rivals seem oddly uninterested in studies of how people actually behave. “To this day” writes Mr Thaler, “the phrase ‘survey evidence’ is rarely heard in economics circles without the necessary adjective ‘mere’ which rhymes with sneer.” One example is the idea that firms seek to maximise profits by increasing output until the marginal cost of making more equals the marginal revenue from selling more. Surveys showed that ""none of the executives reported doing anything that appeared to resemble 'equating at the margin'. First they did not seem to think about the effect of changes in the prices of their products or the possibility of changing what they paid to workers. Instead, they reported trying to sell as much of their product as they could and increasing or decreasing the workforce to meet that level of demand."" In other words, they focused on sales, not profits.
Individuals have a number of biases which traditional economists would struggle to explain. There is the “endowment effect” – people attach a higher value to goods they already own than to identical goods that they don’t. In their heads, the buying and selling prices of goods are quite different. People also suffer from “sunk cost” syndrome; if they paid $100 for a ticket to a sports game, they are more likely to drive to the match in a blizzard than if the ticket had been free. And another issue is “hyperbolic discounting” – people value the receipt of a good (or income) in the short term much more highly than they do in the long term.
On top of these biases, individuals face enormous practical difficulties in doing what economists assume they do all the time – maximize their utility. The future simply has too many variables to be knowable. Take, for example, the standard definition of the value of a single share; it is equal to the future cashflows from said share discounted at the appropriate rate. But what will those cashflows be? Analysts struggle to forecast the outlook for companies over the next 12 months, let alone over decades. And the right discount rate depends on the level of investors’ risk aversion, which can vary a lot from month to month. Robert Shiller won his Nobel prize, in part, for showing that the market price of shares was far more volatile than it would have been had investors had perfect foresight of the future dividends they would have received.
However, the academic theories of finance that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s were built on the assumption of rationality. There were a number of important planks to the theory. The efficient market hypothesis argued that market prices reflect publicly available information (in the strongest form of the hypothesis, even private information was baked into the price). Buying shares in Google because its latest profits were good, or because of a particular pattern in the price charts, was unlikely to deliver an excess return.
Another important concept was the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). This stated, in essence, that riskier assets should offer higher returns. Risk in this sense meant more volatile. The key measure was the correlation of a share with the overall market, or beta in the jargon. A stock that is less volatile than the market will have a beta of less than 1 and will offer modest returns; a stock that is more volatile than the market will have a beta greater than 1 and will offer above-average returns.
Linked to these ideas was the Miller-Modigliani theorem (named after the two academics that devised it) that the market would be indifferent to the way that a company was financed. Adding more debt to a company’s balance-sheet might be riskier for the shareholders but would not affect the overall value of the group.
None of these ideas are stupid. Indeed they embed age-old common sense maxims such as “there is no such thing as a free lunch” or “if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is”. The failure of professional fund managers to beat the market on a consistent basis is often cited as evidence for the efficient market hypothesis. Indeed the insight helped establish the case for the growth of low cost “tracker funds” which mimic benchmarks such as the S&P 500 index. Such funds enable retail investors to get a broad exposure to the stockmarket at low cost. Furthermore the link between risk and reward is a pretty good rule of thumb. Beware any salesman who offers a “sure thing” paying 8% a year.
Nor should it be implied that academics are unaware that these models involve a degree of simplification – ignoring transaction costs, for example, or the difficulties involved in traders being able to borrow enough money to bring prices into line. Cliff Asness, head of the fund management firm AQR, says that few people think the markets are perfectly efficient. Investors do not naively assume that traditional models are right; they are constantly trying to adapt them to take account of market realities.
Indeed, there is a vigorous debate in academia about the importance of market anomalies, such as the tendency for stocks that have risen in the recent past to keep going up (momentum). Do they reflect a hidden risk factor that (on the CAPM principle) deserves a greater reward? Or are they simply be the result of “data mining”; torture the numbers enough and some quirk will assuredly appear. A paper by Campbell Harvey and Yan Liu in the Journal of Portfolio Management last year argued that “most of the empirical research in finance ... is likely false” because it is not subject to sufficiently rigorous statistical tests.
The market is always right
In the run-up to the crisis, these minutiae were largely irrelevant. Central bankers and regulators, led by Alan Greenspan, had absorbed the underlying message of the traditional model; that market prices were the best judges of true value, that bubbles were thus unlikely to form and, crucially, that those who worked in the financial sector had sufficient wisdom and self-control to limit their risks, with the help of market pressure. A bit like Keynes’s wisecrack about practical men being slaves of a defunct economist, financiers and regulators were slaves of defunct finance professors.
One important consequence of this reasoning emerged in a quote from David Viniar, chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, in August 2007. He said that “We were seeing things that were 25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row.” To put this in perspective, even an eight-standard deviation event should not have occurred in the entire history of the universe. Any model that produces such a result must be wrong.
Mr Viniar was relying on “value at risk” models which supposedly allowed investment banks to predict the maximum loss they might suffer on any given day. But these models assumed that markets would behave in reasonably predictable ways; with returns mimicking the “bell curve” that appears in natural phenomena such as human heights. In other words, extreme events, such as the ones in August 2007, are as unlikely as a 30-foot human.
Indeed, there is no reason that such events should happen if markets are efficient. However, markets display a herd mentality in which assets (such as sub-prime mortgages) become fashionable. Investors pile in, driving prices higher and encouraging more investors to take part. Charles Kindleberger, the economic historian, said that “There is nothing so disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich.” If other people are making a fortune by buying tech stocks, or by trading up in the housing market, then there is a huge temptation to take part, in case one gets left behind.
This herd mentality means that financial assets are not like other goods; demand tends to increase when they rise in price. To the extent that investors worry about valuations, they tend to be extremely flexible; expectations of future profits growth are adjusted higher until the price can be justified. Or “alternative” valuation measures are dreamed up (during the internet era, there was “price-to-click”) that make the price look reasonable.
When confidence falters, there are many sellers and virtually no buyers, driving prices sharply downwards. Indeed, in 2008, assets that had not previously been correlated with each other all fell at once, further confounding the banks’ models of investment banks. Assets that were supposedly safe (like AAA-rated securities linked to subprime mortgages) fell heavily in price.
When this happened with dotcom stocks in 2000-2002, the problem was survivable. Some technology funds lost 90% of their value but, for most investors, such funds formed only a small portion of their savings. The problems became more intense with subprime mortgages because the owners of such assets were leveraged; that is, they had financed their purchases with borrowed money. They were forced to sell to cover their debts. And when some could not cover their debts, confidence in the whole system broke.
Leverage was a factor that was not really allowed for in mainstream economic models. To economists, debt is important to the extent that, in a sophisticated economy, it allows individuals to smooth their consumption over their lifetimes. For every debtor, there is a creditor, so a loss to one side must be offset by a gain to another; net global debt is always zero.
Similarly, for financial regulators, the rise of complex structured products like collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) was merely a sign that the system was getting better at parcelling up and dispersing risk to those best able to bear it. Federal Reserve discussions in the 2004-06 barely mentioned CDOs and their like, while in the decade preceding the banking collapse, the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee spent just 2% of its meetings discussing banks. In “Stress Test”, his book on the crisis, then New York Fed Chairman Tim Geithner said “We weren’t expecting default levels high enough to destabilise the entire financial system. We didn’t realise how panic-induced fire sales and radically diminished expectations could cause the kind of losses we thought could only happen in a full-blown economic depression.”
Function failure
What is the finance sector supposed to do? Essentially, it needs to perform a number of basic economic functions. First and foremost, it operates the payments system without which most transactions could not occur. Secondly, it channels funds from individual savers to the corporate sector so the latter can finance its expansion. In doing so, it does the highly useful service of maturity transformation; allowing households to have short-term assets (deposits) while making long-term loans. It also creates diversified products (such as mutual funds) that help to reduce the risk to savers of catastrophic loss. Thirdly, it provides liquidity to the market by buying and selling assets. The prices established in the course of this process are a useful signal of which companies offer the most attractive use for capital and which governments are the most profligate. Fourthly, the sector helps individuals and companies to manage risks, whether physical (fire and theft) or financial (sudden currency movements).
However, partly (but far from wholly) because of the crisis, the sector is not performing some of its roles very well. In recent years, for example, banks have seemed reluctant to lend money to the small businesses need to drive economic expansion. Instead of raising funds from savers, American companies are returning more cash to shareholders (in the form of dividends and buy-backs) than the other way round. The bond market vigilantes have been neutered; central banks have intervened to keep bond yields down despite high deficits across the western world.
Another problem is that the basic utility functions of banking (payments, corporate lending) are boring and not that profitable. The big money has been made elsewhere. In their paper for the BIS, Stephen Cecchetti and Enisse Kharroubi show that rapid growth in the finance sector tends to a lead to a decline in productivity growth. Two factors may be at work. First, the high salaries offered in finance divert the smartest graduates away from other sectors of the economy. Second, bankers prefer to lend against solid collateral, in particular property; periods of rapid credit growth tend to be associated with property booms. But construction and property are not particularly productive sectors. The net effect is that resources are diverted away from the most productivity-enhancing sectors of the economy.
In his speech, Luigi Zingales cast doubt on some of the finance sector’s other services. “There is remarkably little evidence that the existence or the size of an equity market matters for growth” he said, adding that the same is true for the junk bond market, the options and futures market or the development of over-the-counter derivatives. That raises the uncomfortable possibility that a lot of the finance sector’s returns may be down to the exploitation of customers.
A related issue is that the finance sector’s profits may come from “rent-seeking”—the excess returns that can be earned by exploiting a monopoly position. Here the finance sector’s very importance, and its ability to cause economic havoc, plays to its advantage. The 1930s showed the danger of letting banks fail. So governments stand behind the banking system—in the form of deposit insurance—and that means banks benefit from cheap funding. Because central banks worry about the effect on consumer confidence of plunging asset prices, they intervene when markets wobble. Both tendencies encouraged the finance sector to expand their balance sheets and speculate in the markets in the run-up to 2007. Indeed, the people who had risen to the top of investment banks such as Dick Fuld at Lehman Brothers or Jimmy Cayne at Bear Stearns, had a risk-taking mentality. In a Darwinian process, their approach had brought them success in the markets of the 1980s and 1990s, making them appear the leaders best adapted to the modern environment.
The eventual result was that banks were bailed out by the governments and central banks—a combination of privatised profits and nationalised losses that was staggeringly unpopular with the public. So why not simply let the banks fail and share prices crash, as free market theorists would suggest? The problem is that politicians and regulators, given what happened in the 1930s, are simply unwilling to take that risk. The maturity transformation performed by banks makes them inherently risky; they are borrowing short and lending long, and that risk cannot be eliminated entirely. As Tim Geithner wrote “trying to mete out punishment to perpetrators during a genuinely systemic crisis - by letting major firms fail or forcing senior creditors to take haircuts - can pour gasoline on the fire. Old Testament vengeance appeals to the populist fury of the moment, but the truly moral thing to do during a raging financial inferno is to put it out.”
One born every minute
As well as benefiting from government protection, banks have another advantage: the sale of complex products to unsophisticated investors, who fail to understand either the risks involved or to spot the charges hidden within the product’s structure. The long series of scandals involving subprime mortgages, the fixing of Libor rates (short-term borrowing costs) and exchange rate manipulation has indicated the scale of the problem; Mr Zingales points out that financial companies paid $139 billion in fines to American regulators between January 2012 and December 2014.
Such problems would not occur if the economic models held true and all investors were operating with perfect information and were completely rational. But
there is an obvious information asymmetry between the banks and their customers. This was neatly illustrated by a recent US report which showed what happens to financial advice when the advisers are remunerated by the product providers; they were more likely to recommend high-charging products, costing Americans an estimated $17 billion a year. Indeed, one problem with financial products is that they are not like toasters, where a consumer can instantly see if something is wrong; it may take years (decades in the case of pensions) for the problems to become apparent. By that time, it may be too late for consumers to repair the damage to their wealth.
But the crisis was not just the result of poor financial regulation, it was also down to the failure of economists to understand the importance of debt. A few commentators, such as William White of the Bank for International Settlements, had warned about the issue in advance. But their warnings were ignored. It turned out that debt is not a zero sum game, in which any loss to creditors is matched by a gain to borrowers. If a loan is secured against a property, and the property price falls sharply, both the lender and the borrower can suffer; the borrower loses his deposit (and possibly his home) while the lender has to write down the value of the loan. In their book “House of Debt”, published in 2014, Atif Mian and Amir Sufi, showed that American regions with lots of highly-levered homeowners suffered more in the recession than areas where buyers had borrowed less. Households had financed their expenditure during the boom with borrowed money, particularly in America where equity withdrawal from houses was highly common. Raghuram Rajan, the economist who is now India’s central bank governor, called this “Let them eat credit”.
In the corporate sector, the Miller-Modigliani theory implied the markets should be indifferent as to whether companies should finance themselves with equity or debt. But interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, giving debt finance an advantage. Furthermore, companies with cash on their balance sheets were encouraged by activist shareholders to return money to investors. Steadily, the corporate sector (and in particular the banks) became more leveraged. However if a company has a lot of its debt on its balance-sheet, it is highly sensitive to a small adverse change in market conditions since these can wipe out the value of its equity and cause it to go bust. A more levered economy will be more volatile.
The response
Regulators have tried to tackle some of these issues by insisting that banks hold more capital on their balance sheet, to make them less vulnerable to plunging asset prices. The rules also mean that banks devote less capital to trading. But these approaches run into the St Augustine problem, who proclaimed “Lord, give me chastity, but not yet.” The efforts of the banks to improve their capital base has made them chary about lending to business, thereby slowing the recovery. Their retreat from market-making has made financial markets less liquid; some fund managers fear the next crisis may occur in corporate bonds, which investors have bought in search of higher yields. When investors try to sell, the banks will be unwilling to offer a market, causing prices to plunge; some funds may be forced to suspend redemptions, leading to a crisis of confidence.
Another regulatory approach is to focus on “macroprudential policy”. One of the reasons central bankers were reluctant to tackle high asset prices was that their only tool was interest rates. But higher rates would damage the rest of the economy, as much as it would tackle market excess. A more sophisticated approach would use other tools, such as restricting the ratio of loans to property values. At the peak of the boom, no deposits were required. But it remains to be seen whether regulators will have the willpower to use such tools at the top of the next boom or indeed whether eager homeowners will find ways round the rules, for example by borrowing from unregulated lenders.
What about the response of economists? There has been a lot of work in recent years about the role of debt including, most famously, the studies of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. Unfortunately, this debate has been sidelined on to the narrow issue of the level of government debt rather than the aggregate level of debt in the economy. Iceland and Ireland did not have a lot of government debt before the crisis; it was their bank debt that caused the trouble. The reaction from Keynesian economists like Paul Krugman is that a focus on debt is simply a right-wing excuse to impose needless austerity on the economy.
The use of quantitative easing (QE) to stabilise economies has made it a lot easier to service debts and indeed has prompted many to argue that deficits are irrelevant in a country that borrows in its own currency and has a compliant central bank. Very little of the pre-crisis debt has been eliminated; it has just been redistributed onto government balance sheets. But QE has also forced up asset prices, boosting the wealth of the richest, and making it even more difficult for central banks to reverse policy. Even now, many years after the crisis, and with their economies growing and unemployment having fallen, the Federal Reserve and Bank of England have yet to push up rates. Perhaps they will never be able to return rates to what, before the crisis, would have been deemed normal levels (4-5%) nor indeed will they be able to unwind all their asset purchases.
So we have ended up, after three decades of worshipping free markets, with a system in which the single most dominant players in setting asset prices are central banks and in which financiers are much bigger receivers of government largesse than any welfare cheat could dream about. Economic and financial theory have not adjusted to this situation; can a market be efficient, or properly balance risk and reward, if the dominant players are central banks, who are not interested in maximising their profits?
The challenge
For all their criticism of mainstream economists, the challenge for the behavioural school is to come up with a coherent model that can produce testable predictions about the overall economy. They have grown in influence with governments adopting their “nudge” ideas on how to influence behaviour; asking people to opt out of pension plans rather than opt into them, improves the take-up rate. In effect, the rules rely on inertia; people can’t be bothered to fill in the forms required to opt out.
At the macro level, however, a coherent model is yet to emerge. George Cooper, a fund manager and author, has argued that economics needs the kind of scientific revolution driven by Newton and Einstein.
The most promising approaches may be based on our growing understanding of the brain. Neuroscientists have shown that monetary gain stimulates the same reward circuitry as cocaine – in both cases, dopamine is released into the nucleus accumbens. “In the case of cocaine, we call this addiction. In the case of monetary gain, we call it capitalism"" says Andrew Lo of the Massachsetts Institute of Technology.
Similarly the threat of financial loss apparently activates the same fight-or-flight response as a physical attack, releasing adrenalin and cortisol into the bloodstream. Risk-averse decisions are associated with the anterior insula, the part of the brain associated with disgust. In other words, we react to investment losses rather as we react to a bad smell.
Another important finding is that humans would not improve their thinking if they turned into the emotionless Vulcans of Star Trek. Patients who have suffered damage to the parts of the brain most associated with emotional responses seem to have difficulty in making decisions. “Emotions are the basis for a reward-and-punishment system that facilitates the selection of advantageous behaviour” says Mr Lo. Humans also follow heuristics or “rules of thumb” that guide our responses to certain stimuli; these may have developed when mankind lived in much more dangerous surroundings. If you hear a rustle in the bushes, it may well not be a tiger; but the safest option is to run away first and assess the danger afterwards.
In the second world war, bomber crews had the choice of wearing a parachute or a flak jacket; donning both was too bulky. The former helped if the plane was shot down, the latter protected crew from shrapnel caused by anti-aircraft fire. Getting hit by shrapnel was statistically more likely so the rational choice would be to wear the flak jacket every time. Instead the crews varied their garb, roughly in proportion to the chances of the two outcomes—although there was no way they could predict the outcome of a single mission.
Mr Lo argues that this approach may sound arbitrary but such behaviour may be rational from an evolutionary perspective. Take an animal that has a choice of nesting in a valley or a plateau; the valley offers shade from the sun (good for raising offspring) but vulnerability to floods (killing all offspring). The plateau offers protection from floods (good for offspring) but no shade (killing all offspring). The probability of sunshine is 75%. So the “rational” decision from the individual’s perspective would be to stay in the valley. But if a flood occurs, the entire species would be wiped out. It makes more sense for the species if individuals probability match. “When reproductive risk is systematic, natural selection favours randomising behaviour to avoid extinction” he writes.
Mr Lo’s view is that markets are normally efficient but not always and everywhere efficient. He dubs this “adaptive market theory”—and sees it as a consequence of human behaviour, particularly herd instinct. Watching other people suffer triggers an empathetic reaction. When other investors are panicking in a period of market turmoil, we tend to panic too.
A similar approach, dubbed the fractal market hypothesis, is advanced by Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research. This acknowledges that investors with different time horizons interpret the same information differently. “The momentum-based high frequency trader might interpret a sharp one-day sell-off as a sell signal” he says, “but the value-based pension fund might interpret the same information as a buying opportunity. This disagreement will create liquidity without requiring a big price adjustment. Thereby it also fosters market stability.”
But if the different groups start to agree—groupthink, in other words—liquidity will evaporate as everyone wants to buy or sell at the same time. In such a situation, price changes may become violent. Mr Joshi thinks central bank interference in the markets is accordingly dangerous since it creates uniform mentality among investors in which easier monetary policy is always a good thing for asset prices.
Another area of research is to view the markets as a classic example of the principal-agent problem where many market participants are not investing their own money but acting on behalf of others. Paul Woolley and Dimitri Vayanos of the London School of Economics see this as a potential explanation for the momentum effect. Investors choose fund managers on the basis of their past performance; they will naturally pick those that have done well. When they switch, the successful manager will receive money that he will reinvest in his favourite stocks; by definition, these are likely to be stocks that have recently performed well. This inflow of cash will push such stocks up even further.
Another example of the principal-agent mismatch at work may lie in the incentive structure for executives. Ironically, this all stems from an attempt to align the interests of executives and shareholders more closely. In the 1980s, academics worried that executives were too interested in empire-building—creating bigger companies that would justify bigger salaries for themselves—and not focusing on shareholder returns. So they were given options over shares. In the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s, these options made many executives extremely rich; CEO pay has risen eightfold in real terms since the 1970s. These riches have come at the price of impermanence; the average tenure of a CEO has fallen from 12 years to 6.
The combination may have made executives oversensitive to short-term fluctuations in the share price at the expense of long-term investment; a survey showed that executives would reject a project with a positive rate of return if it damaged the company’s ability to meet the next quarter’s earnings target. This may explain why record-low interest rates have not resulted in the splurge of business investment that economists and central bankers were hoping for. Again the financial system is not working well.
An evolving task
Another important issue for academics to consider is that the financial sector is not static. Each crisis induces changes in behaviour and new regulations that prompt market participants to adjust (and to find new ways to game the system). In any case, regulators cannot eliminate risk altogether. In terms of consumer protection, regulators cannot set a standard for the right product that should be sold in all circumstances. Investors’ attitude towards risk may differ (indeed their ex ante willingness to take risk may differ from their ex post feelings when bad things happen.) And even if the salesman and the clients were equally well informed, the correct asset allocation (between, say, equities and bonds or America and Japan) cannot be known in advance.
Indeed, the attempt to create a riskless world may be counter-productive. Cliff Asness of AQR says that “Making people understand that there is a risk (and a separate issue, making them bear that risk) is far more important, and indeed far more possible than making a riskless world. And if I may go further, trying to create and worse, giving the impression you have created, a riskless world makes things much more dangerous.”
There will never be an “answer” that eliminates all crises; that is not in the nature of finance and economics. But for too long economists ignored the role that debt and asset bubbles play in exacerbating economic booms and busts; it needs to be much more closely studied. Even if the market is efficient most of the time, we need to worry about the times when it is not. Academics and economists need to deal with the world as it is, not the world that is easily modelled.",0
"If you want to get rid of mold in your home, the best way is to do it naturally, without using any chemicals. Use natural ingredients that would not cause any harm to you or your family. Mold can be bad for your health. They can lead to depression or tiredness in some people and they can be the reason for many allergies and irritations.
There are many products on the market, but we are going to present you natural ingredients that can help you to get rid of mold.
Vinegar
Pour some vinegar in an empty bottle and spray it on the mold surface. If you want you can dilute the vinegar with some water. However we recommend using only vinegar because it is more efficient and stronger. Leave the vinegar for a few hours and afterwards use a brush to scrub the surface.
If the smell is strong add a couple of drops of essential oil by choice. White vinegar can eliminate 82% of the mold spores. You can also use it to prevent them, just spray on the areas and let it dry completely.
Hydrogen peroxide
Use 3% hydrogen peroxide to spray on the mold surface. Leave it for approximately 10 minutes and then scrub the wall; use a damp cloth to wipe the surface and if you want you can mix the hydrogen peroxide with baking soda and vinegar. The spray bottle should be kept on a dry and dark place.
Solution made of tea tree solution
Many of the methods for eliminating mold are natural, but some of them are expensive. This solution is expensive and you will use only 2 spoons from it. Combine 2 tablespoons of this mixture with 2 cups of water and add it in a spray bottle. Spray it on the mold surface and do not wash it off. The smell of this oil will be gone in a few days.
Extract from citrus seed and water
This extract does not smell. You can use 20 drop and combine them with 2 cups of water. Pour the mixture in a spray bottle and spray the mold surface. Never wash it off.
Baking soda
This is a natural and very powerful ingredient. Combine baking soda with water and spray it on the surface with mold. Leave it for a few minutes and scrub it with a brush. Then wipe the surface with a damp cloth. You will get rid of the mold and the unpleasant smell will go away.
To prevent mold you just need to wipe the surface regularly using a damp cloth, then spray some vinegar, look out for leaks and use a cold mist humidifier.

"Ultra-high tech merges with an old-school concealment classic to make U. S. special operations forces vehicles vanish before the eyes of an enemy.
Camouflage and deception have long played roles in war. Saab Barracuda has developed the Breakaway camouflage system. While camouflage nets are certainly not new, this revolutionary net takes advantage of futuristic materials and smart design to take camouflage nets to the next level.
Teams can use Breakaway to keep their fast, light vehicles hidden and then can instantly take off from underneath the net if they need to make a speedy exit or a surprise launch at the enemy.
US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has already been quietly deploying these smart nets on operations.
Breakaway is being featured this week at the annual Association of the US Army (AUSA) conference, an exhibition of the latest in land warfare innovation held in Washington D. C. These nets are going like hotcakes, as SOCOM just received nine additional orders before the conference started.
What is it?
The concept is familiar. If you have ever seen netting slung over military vehicles, then the idea is basically the same.
Use camouflage to prevent unwanted attention and prying eyes from noticing that there is a tank there – and instead whatever you are hiding with the camouflage will blend into the terrain unnoticed.
What can it do?
These days, it is not nearly enough for camouflage nets to fool the naked eye.
Breakaway defeats all sorts of key sensors that an enemy may use to try to locate US forces. It can defeat an enemy scanning with the naked eye, but it will also keep the vehicle concealed when enemies are kitted up with thermal devices.
Broadband radar? No problem. Breakaway will not let it reveal the vehicles beneath the state of the art nets.
An enemy could try to locate US Special Operations teams with near infrared and shortwave infrared, but they’ll have no luck spotting their vehicles while shielded with the Breakaway camouflage.
PODCAST: LEARN TO THINK LIKE A SEAL TEAM 6 COMMANDER
How does it work?
It is a simple as an operator pulling up a motorbike or a Polaris Defense RAZR ATV and throwing the Breakaway net over it. Done. Multi-spectral protection.
When an operator is ready to go, they just have to back up about a foot and detach the front net. They can then just drive straight out of the net.
Every moment can matter on a mission, so the speed with which an operator can access a vehicle that has been camouflaged and can drive off matters greatly.
The ease and ultra-rapid speed with which Breakaway camouflage can be disengaged is a great advantage. With Breakaway, camouflage will not delay the ability to move quickly out from underneath.
How is it made?
The new Breakaway system is constructed differently than typical designs.
In addition to incredibly advanced material that can defeat such an array of advanced state of the art sensors, Breakaway relies on something that Saab Barracuda calls an “onion stitch.” Typically, conventional camouflage uses vertical stitching.
This onion stitching is part of the secret as to why a small tear will not rip the Breakaway net apart like typical camouflage nets. Instead, the stitching acts as a sort of rip stop.
And camouflage nets that don’t tear are reusable, which is both convenient and lighter on the SOCOM wallet.
PODCAST: HOW THIS ARMED ANGEL OF THE BATTLEFIELD SAVED LIVES IN THE REAL “BLACK HAWK DOWN”
Breakaway has been mostly used for special operations vehicles and the system is ideal for special operations community work. It works best with the General Dynamics “Flyer” as well as Polaris Defense DAGOR, and MRZR vehicles.
It is customized and tailored to specific requirements. For example, the Flyer version is different to the MRZR. So there are versions possible for bigger vehicles like the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle.
Who else uses it?
Having just received some of the Breakaway design for the DAGOR, USSOCOM has 55 more Breakaway nets for the Flyer heading their way in a November delivery.
Saab Barracuda’s mobile camouflage system is standard in eight NATO countries.
Saab Barracuda had been supplying Ultra-Lightweight Camouflage-Net System for ten years.
This summer, the Army started an initiative seeking a new generation of camouflage nets. If the Army will need to face adversaries in the future who possess modern tech like advanced and ever growing sensors, drones that surveil wide areas from the sky to detect and provide targeting data, then upgrading the Army camouflage net systems becomes particularly important.
So it is no surprise then that Saab’s revolutionary twist on the humble camouflage net has been drawing a steady stream of crowds of army officials from around the world as they walk the AUSA floors.

"A High Court judge is to decide whether it was unlawful to order Lord Janner to appear in person in court to face child sex abuse charges.
Last week, Janner failed to appear in court and the magistrate ruled that the former Labour peer, 87, must appear in person for the hearing which was adjourned until Friday 14th August.
A warrant could be issued for Janner’s arrest if he fails to attend court the judge warned.
Lawyers acting on behalf of Janner, who has dementia and denies the charges, argued he was too ill to attend court.
If his dementia is ruled to be too advanced, a trial of fact could be held with jurors asked to rule if Lord Janner carried out the acts with which he is charged.
The former Labour peer is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Friday for a brief hearing.
But his legal team has launched a High Court challenge in a last-ditch bid to overturn the decision, claiming it is unlawful and a breach of his human rights.
The hearing will be heard on Thursday afternoon but if Lord Janner loses, he will be expected at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Friday.
Howard Riddle, the chief magistrate, who has demanded that he attend court, has made various arrangements to ensure the appearance is not too distressing for the 87-year-old, who has dementia.
He will enter via a side entrance and make his way to the courtroom via step free access. The former MP will will stand in the well of the court, rather than the dock, and have the option of being accompanied by a relative, a nurse and a member of his legal team. The entire process is expected to be over by a minute past 10am.
Judge Riddle acknowledged that proceedings were dependant on the outcome of the High Court challenge, but he said: “If the requirement remains for Lord Janner to attend and he does not, I will be expecting the Crown to make their suggestions as to how best to proceed.
“If that is by application of a warrant, then the judge sitting on that occasion will want to know what special arrangements have been made by the Crown to enforce the warrant.”
He added: “I am satisfied that the journey to this court is reasonable and that arrangements can be made for the defendant to come into this courtroom with as little distress as can be expected in view of his condition.”
Judge Riddle said he was not prepared to adjourn the hearing but agreed that if High Court proceedings were ongoing then Lord Janner would not be expected to attend.
Paul Ozin, for Lord Janner, earlier told the court he had requested the High Court “urgently” hear an application to overturn the decision to force his client to attend.
“Our position is that the decision in itself is unlawful and is not capable or being rendered lawful by any of the measures currently being contemplated,” he said.
He said the “onerous task” of getting Lord Janner to court would cause him “considerable distress and harm” which would violate his rights under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act.",1
"Democrats pummeled President Donald Trump’s pick to lead NASA at his confirmation hearing Wednesday, criticizing his past controversial statements on gay rights and climate change as well as poking holes in his professional qualifications.
Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), ranking member on the Senate Commerce Committee, commended Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.) for his military service but said his experience as a pilot does not alone qualify him to lead NASA and make the budgetary and engineering decisions that come with the job.
The senator also slammed Bridenstine for numerous statements he has made, including discriminatory remarks about the LGBT community and a denial that people contribute to climate change.
“Your recent public service career does not instill great confidence about your leadership skills or ability to bring people together,” Nelson said. “In fact, your record and behavior in Congress is as divisive and extreme as any in Washington.”
In 2013, Bridenstine called the Supreme Court decision declaring same-sex marriage constitutional a “disappointment.” He also called former President Barack Obama’s executive order allowing transgender students to use the bathroom of their identified gender “lawless federal bullying.”
Remarks like these drew gay rights advocacy groups to try to derail his nomination. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) also urged colleagues in a letter last week to oppose Bridenstine's nomination over these remarks.
Asked directly how LGBT employees at NASA should feel if he is confirmed, Bridenstine said multiple times that he believes “from my heart that every human being has dignity and worth” and promised to treat all employees equally.
Bridenstine also was asked to answer for his past statements on climate change, including that the global temperature stopped rising a decade ago. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) repeatedly pressed Bridenstine on his views, asking how much of an impact he believes people have had on the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
“What concerns me the most, in addition to everything Sen. Nelson said, is that this is a science agency. … I get that you don’t have a science-centric background, and I don’t begrudge you that,” Schatz said. “I don’t have a science background, but you know what I do do: I defer to scientists.”
Bridenstine said he believes human activity contributes to the levels of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere but that scientists are “just scratching the surface” on understanding the Earth’s system. He promised Sen. Tom Udall (D-N. M.) that science would drive the mission at NASA, and that he’d express that view to others in the administration as well if he is confirmed.
Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) defended Bridenstine for his remarks, saying that the climate has undergone “wild swings” for decades that were never linked directly to humans.
“Let me say something about scientific consensus: It hasn’t always been right,” he said. “Galileo challenged scientific consensus, [Nicolaus] Copernicus challenged scientific consensus at their peril, and it turns out they were right, but they were alone for a while.”
Nelson also criticized Bridenstine for past efforts to stamp out bipartisanship, including attacks against politicians in his own party for working across the aisle, including former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).
“NASA needs a leader who will unite us, not divide us,” Nelson said. “Respectfully, Congressman Bridenstine, I think you’ve got a long way to go to prove to be that leader.”
But Bridenstine explained those past remarks as things that best represented his constituents in Oklahoma and said that the politics of immigration reform and other issues wouldn’t be relevant to his leadership of NASA.
“The advocacy I’ve had for the constituents of Oklahoma is the same advocacy I’d like to bring to NASA,” Bridenstine said in response to questioning from Nelson, before adding, “Working with you sir, that absolutely is my highest ambition.”
Bridenstine also supported Kelli Ward, Sen. John McCain’s Republican primary challenger, who accused the Arizona senator of being directly responsible for the rise of ISIS and later said she hoped McCain would step down from the Senate following his cancer diagnosis.
When Nelson asked the congressman whether he supported these remarks, he said he endorsed Ward only because a friend in the National Guard had asked him to.
“I don’t live in Arizona, and I’m not aware of these comments,” he said.
Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) came to Bridenstine’s aid on his past criticism of those in his own party, saying that Nelson himself supported Hillary Clinton in her run for president, even though she criticized liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
“I cannot for the life of me understand why this would be something that disqualifies you,” Lee said.
Republicans criticized their Democratic colleagues for making the confirmation hearing a referendum on climate change and Bridenstine’s past statements rather than questioning him on how he’d advance the nation’s space program. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) called it “a little bit disgusting.”
Bridenstine struck a very bipartisan tone in his opening statement, stressing the need for partnership and transparency to get Americans to space and return them safely back home.
“Should I be confirmed, it will be my intention to build off the work done by the great people at NASA during the last administration,” he said. “We must all do this together.”
Bridenstine laid out some of his vision for the future of the country’s space program, saying he supports the administration’s plan to get to Mars by using the moon as a “proving ground.”",0
"More than 20 years have passed since the first online casinos went live and opened a whole new range of possibilities for gamblers worldwide. With hundreds of gambling websites operating today, it is easier than ever to indulge in casino games, lottery and sports betting. Living has become fast and furious lately, making frequent visits to brick and mortar casinos a very hard feat to pull off for many of us. Online gambling, especially mobile, is an alternative we can’t afford to pass on, even if we miss the buzz and excitement of our favorite physical locations. But for all its benefits, there are hidden dangers lurking here that only internet can spawn. Virtual world is a fertile ground for rogue casinos to make a quick buck scamming unsuspecting customers who are than forced to deal with unpaid winnings or horrendously slow payouts, frustrating and poorly worded rules, or just plain cheating by the house. They take your money and disappear, leaving you with limited options to remedy the situation, not to mention identity thefts, hacked accounts and access to your finances. Losing money like this is easier to get over when small amounts are concerned, but foregoing big wins is a tough pill to swallow. Real money play online will always carry certain risks no matter what you do to protect yourself, however that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take all the necessary precautions prior to depositing your hard-earned money anywhere.
It’s not easy picking out a casino when there’s hundreds of them all making the same claims about ethical practices being their primary concern. Fortunately, there are viable sources you can consult when trying to decide where to deposit money, one of them beinggamesandcasino.com. This is a trusted source for all gambling related matters that has regularly updated lists of blacklisted casinosas well as reputable casinos that have proven themselves with numerous satisfied players enjoying their content. There are several reasons that get the bad ones crossed out: they have poor payout percentage, ignore withdrawal requests, feature counterfeit software or operate without a legal license. The requirements casinos must fulfill to be included on approved lists are strict and include a trustworthy license, reputable and tested software providers, clear and concise terms and conditions, as well as little or no unresolved complaints. Whilegamesandcasino.combases these lists on available official legal cases and inquiries among other things, it is mostly players feedback taken into account when assessing the integrity of an online casino. Due to a specific nature of internet gambling, you can never be guaranteed an ethical conduct, as player reports can be untruthful as often as they are honest. Sometimes, a certain casino may suffer its reputation forever tarnished over a false accusation or a simple misunderstanding. In any case, consulting trusted portals is your best bet – it is their job to provide players with accurate information about online casinos and help make your search as easy as possible. This is their advice to players who are interested to know how best to protect themselves when gambling online:
Unregulated Casinos Answer to No One, Least of All Players
Even if there is a license listed at the bottom of the website you’re aiming at, it might be false and that’s something to keep in mind at all times. Read the license information carefully, look for the license registration number and check its validity by any means you can. If it seems incomplete or sounds in any way suspicious, goggle it – shady casinos and licenses are almost always mentioned somewhere on the interwebs. If there’s any doubt about it, it goes without saying you should skip the casino and look elsewhere for better conditions. Acquiring a license to run online casinos is relatively inexpensive, and there’s no reason not to obtain it for any honest operator. The UK, Malta, Gibraltar, Isle of Man are some of the most common reputable jurisdictions that legally regulate online gambling operations.
Reputable casinos will always emphasize the security systems they use to provide safe play and secured bank transactions. It is in your best interest to find a casino whose gaming software is embedded with the best data encryption technology designed to protect deposits and withdrawals from hackers, as well as your personal information from identity theft. If you notice terms like 128-bit, SSL data encryption and providers mentioned like Cryptologic or Microgaming, that means you’re probably dealing with a decent casino.
Next on your check list should be banking methods. Multiple payment methods that include debit or credit cards and third party services such as Neteller, Skrill or Paypal are always a good indication simply because they allow little of your financial information to be disclosed to operators, and that’s something rouge casinos and con artists wouldn’t gladly accept.
No matter how much you find them annoying, verification procedures are norms for regulated operators and exist for your benefit as well. Huge amounts of money are circulating through casinos every day, and you wouldn’t want them treating your big win casually, as if it’s just a few pennies worth that might end up in someone else’s pocket.
Be very careful when conversing with someone claiming to be a representative of the casino. You should never disclose passwords or any personal information to anyone. Respectable affiliate sites may have official representatives available at their forum, but even then proceed with caution, as not even these sites can guarantee you’ll be treated fairly and within legal bounds.
Casino Bonuses Are Not Always What They Seem
Often times we come across special bonuses promising great advantages, and without thinking twice find ourselves singed up at a casino we know nothing about. Every casino out there has some kind of welcoming package, attracting players with No Deposit Bonuses or certain privileges applied on first, second and even third deposits. Almost by a rule, all casinos good and bad, never disclose full terms and conditions relating to these bonuses. If you don’t take the time to go through Terms & Conditions page where bonus and withdrawals rules are stated, be certain you’ll end up surprised and frustrated with only yourself to blame. Is it a bad practice or a clever business move? A little bit of both.
Depositing may not be required, but most bonus winnings cannot be cashed out unless wagered a certain amount of times, or are not considered valid when won on free spins, certain games or other ridiculous circumstances. These rules are usually stated in small lettering and, more often than not, in such a confusing wording that even an attorney would have difficulty comprehending. It is highly recommended that you take the time to research how these work and what certain ambiguous terms actually mean. An abundance of material on the subject can be found all over the internet, explained in articles and discussed on community forums for everyone to learn. If you did all this and are still unsure about a particular casino, check player complaints – the longer the list, the greater your reason for concern.
Luckily, there are trustworthy casinos out there offering safe play and fair customer treatment. Like it or not, online gambling is the future, and the sooner we arm ourselves with knowledge, the more we will be able to enjoy gambling on the internet. Once you’ve checked approved casinos from a trusted source, there’s no reason not to continue the investigation on your own. Even the best among them can turn rouge at some point, or you can end up being one of just a few unsatisfied customers who were unlucky enough to find themselves in difficult situations. Be diligent and do your homework – investigate licenses, encryptions and pay special attention to what other players have to say. Once you’re coned, it’s game over. Pursuing issues legally is a long, painful and expensive process with no guarantees, it might turn out well, but most of the time you’ll end up disappointed. Follow the above tips and limit the risks involved to turn around your winning poten",1

"Some plane food is fresh and tasty, like this business-class meal on All Nippon Airways. But chances are your best bet is to not eat at all.
Some plane food is fresh and tasty, like this business-class meal on All Nippon Airways. But chances are your best bet is to not eat at all.
At Bloomberg Pursuits, we love to travel. And we always want to make sure we’re doing it right. So we’re talking to globe-trottersin all of our luxury fields—food, wine, fashion, cars, real estate—to learn abouttheir high-end hacks, tips, and off-the-wall experiences. These are the Distinguished Travel Hackers.
Melissa Biggs Bradley is the founder of luxury travel firmIndagare. The membership-based travel club is the secret weapon of 1 Percenters, known for planning and arranging near-impossible trips from chartering planes and yachts to overnights at billionaires’ private islands.
When not planning others’ jaunts, Biggs Bradley herself spends between 3 and 4 months on the road each year, flying around 200,000 miles. “I’m not really loyal to any airline—to me the most important thing is the convenience of the time,” she says, though she recommends Delta domestically and the premium cabins of Air France and Cathay Pacific.
She lives in New York City with her husband and two teenage children.
I eat nothing on flights. I’ve talked to a lot of stewardesses about it, and it’s a stewardess secret. Ten years ago, it was [a cabin crew member] on Singapore Airlines on what was, at the time, the longest flight in the world (17 hours from Singapore to New York). She told me that her tried-and-true trick was not eating in-flight. Basically, at superhigh altitude, your digestive system shuts down completely. Someone said to meit’s like being under anesthesia. So when you get off the plane, everything restarts and [your digestive system] has so much more work to do and so it makes you more tired.
Most people overeat because it’s a diversion, or a way to pass the time; but even the best plane food is oversalted and preserved so it can be microwaved. So I have something to eat a couple hours before getting on the plane, but otherwiseit’s nothing but lots and lots of water. Really and truly, I live by it and I feel so much better. I flew to Paris last week, for example, and I got off the plane atmaybe 10 a.m., and when I landed I went for a fabulous lunch, which I didn’t feel guilty about in the slightest.
How to find a local recommendation in a city where you know no one.
To me, so much about travel is not about where you go but who you meet when you’re there. When you go to another city, you always want to have the name of somebody [to ask for recommendations]. A friend of mine told me one of his tips is always to go and seek out a restaurant with a communal table in any place he’s going where he doesn’t have the name of somebody to look up. It’s an instant way to interact with local people.
Travel insurance is vital—but so is stomach insurance.
A number of years ago, I was in Delhi and I went out to dinner, and immediately started to feel that I was getting food poisoning, which was the first time for me in India. So a friend of mine gave me a jar of probiotics; I popped two or three pills, and the queasy feeling was instantly cured. It was the craziest thing. Ever since then, I take them daily whenever I’m traveling anyplace—I carry Pro-15. I also take Pepto-Bismol pills. The probiotics build up healthy bacteria in your gut and the Pepto-Bismol acts as a prophylactic that coats your digestive track like a protective sleeve and can help filter out organisms in contaminated water or food.
Sometimesit’s smarter not to stay in a five-star hotel.
In some [very popular] cities, you’re better off taking an amazing suite in a four-star hotel instead of the lowest-category room in a five-star. In Rome, for example, you can get something really amazing at the Portrait Suites, or in Barcelona, the Hotel Arts vs. the Majestic Hotel.
How to manage your family during vacation—and how to make the most of it afterward.
If you’re on a multigenerational family trip, announce there are three roles: instructor, documenter, and note taker. Every day, someone has to document everything—they’re the cameraperson. Someone else is taking notes, and someone else is in the position of trip leader, so they have to brush up and give a few minutes’ talk on what you’re seeing today. Every day, rotate those roles, and then at the end of the trip, you have a wonderful record. You can also assign one family member the role of editor, who will compile a book of everyone’s photographs and print it for everyone.
How to get a billionaire to subsidize your vacation.
Many of the most incredible hotel properties in the world today are owned by successful business leaders who fell in love with a place and decided to spend time there but also to share it with paying guests—there’s Dietrich Mateschitz, the founder of Red Bull who turned Malcolm Forbes’s private island in Fiji into the sustainable luxury resort Laucala, or Paul Tudor Jones, who leases a 350,000-acre concession in the northern Serengeti in Tanzania and has lodges like Singita Sasakwaand Sabora. They’ve not built it to monetize it, or as a profit center—they’re just very successful people who fell in love with a place and bought it for their own personal pleasure, investing enormous amounts of money to extremely high standards [for themselves]. As soon as you’re there, you recognize it: You’re paying $3,000 per night, perhaps, to be at one of Paul Tudor Jones’s places, but the value of the food, the activities, the comfort? You think, ‘He’s subsidizingme.’On Laucala, it’s maybe $4,000 per night for two people, all-inclusive, but you literally can be on that island, with the whole place to yourself, and have 400 staff taking care of you.
How to never lose service forjust 10bucks per day.
A friend gave me a Skyroam, the mobile hotspot, a few years ago. You pay $10 per day and it doesn’t matter how much data you use in those 24 hours, whether your kids download three movies or use Instagram, which takes up so much data. Even in a lot of lounges at airports, I use it, as so many people will be on the lounge Wi-Fi it’s too slow, and in a hotel, when there’s a usage charge per device, I can use Skyroam instead—I’ve got five people on the same connection, and I’m not paying the Wi-Fi fee either. The only way you get into trouble with it is if you don’t check the coverage before you go—it doesn’t work in every country, but it’s never failed me. There’s a long list on the website, and it works beautifully in Mexico and Italy and Japan.",0
"No mother should ever have to feel the pain of losing her child. No matter the situation, it’s just too much to handle.
Some moms are able to hang onto a piece of their child even when they’re gone, like this mom who hears her son’s heart in a transplant patient.
While this doesn’t take away the pain, it eases some of the grief to know that your child is still around in some physical way and that, because of them, someone else is able to live each day.
For mothers whose children go into law enforcement or the military, it is always a fear that something could go wrong. These fields are dangerous by nature, and accidents can come at a high cost.
Click Here!
This is something that one mother faced when her Army veteran and state trooper son was killed in a high-speed car chase. It was so devastating that she continued texting his phone number even after he was gone.
For Ernestina Nunez, her soldier son’s death came when PTSD led him to commit suicide. He was Nunez’s only child, and his loss took away her meaning in life.
The high school custodian had lost all hope when auto repair shop owner Richard Newberry stepped in and did something absolutely amazing for the grieving mom.

"Statin cholesterol-lowering drugs are widely touted as the best way to lower your cholesterol and thereby prevent a heart attack. They’re recommended to people who have “high cholesterol,” those who have heart disease, and even for some healthy people as a form of preventive medicine.
Statins are among the most widely prescribed drugs on the market, with more than 1 in 4 Americans over 45 taking them. This already inflated number is set to increase significantly due to draft recommendations issued earlier this year by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).
This federal advisory board recommended statin treatment for people between the ages of 40 and 75 with a 10 percent or greater risk of heart problems in the next 10 years (based on the 2013 AHA-ACC online calculator — even if they have not had a previous heart attack or stroke.
Needless to say, if you’re a U. S. adult aged 40 or beyond, there’s a good chance your doctor may bring up statins at your next visit, so you need to do your homework to determine if these drugs are truly right for you — and there’s a good chance they’re not.
5 Reasons Why You Should Not Take Statins.
Statin drugs work to lower cholesterol, and as your levels fall, you may assume that is proof that you’re getting healthier and lowering your risk of heart disease and heart attack. But that would be far from the truth.
There is far more that goes into your risk of heart disease than your cholesterol levels. Further, there is evidence showing that statins may actually make your heart health worse and only appear effective due to statistical deception.
One report published in the Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology concluded that statin advocates used a statistical tool called relative risk reduction (RRR) to amplify statins’ trivial beneficial effects.
If you look at absolute risk, statin drugs benefit just 1 percent of the population. This means that out of 100 people treated with the drugs, one person will have one less heart attack. This doesn’t sound so impressive, so statin supporters use a different statistic called relative risk.
Just by making this statistical sleight of hand, statins suddenly become beneficial for 30 to 50 percent of the population. As STATS at George Mason University explained, “An important feature of relative risk is that it tells you nothing about the actual risk.”
Statins deplete your body of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which accounts for many of their devastating results. Although it was proposed to add a black box warning to statins stating this, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided against it in 2014.
CoQ10 is used for energy production by every cell in your body, and is therefore vital for good health, high energy levels, longevity, and general quality of life. CoQ10’s reduced form, ubiquinol, is a critical component of cellular respiration and production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
ATP is a coenzyme used as an energy carrier in every cell of your body. When you consider that your heart is the most energy-demanding organ in your body, you can surmise how potentially devastating it can be to deplete your body’s main source of cellular energy.
So while one of statins’ claims to fame is warding off heart disease, you’re actually increasing your risk when you deplete your body of CoQ10. The depletion of CoQ10 caused by the drug is why statins can increase your risk of acute heart failure.
So if you’re taking a statin drug, you MUST take Coenzyme Q10 as a supplement. If you’re over 40, I would strongly recommend taking ubiquinol instead of CoQ10, as it’s far more effectively absorbed by your body.
In every study conducted so far, ubiquinol has been shown to be far more bioavailable than the non-reduced form (CoQ10). Dr. Steven Sinatra,cardiologist and founder of the New England Heart Center, recommends taking at least 100 milligrams (mg), but preferably 200 mg of high-quality CoQ10 or ubiquinol daily.
One study in the European Journal of Pharmacology showed that ubiquinol effectively rescued cells from the damage caused by the statin drug simvastatin, thereby protecting muscle cells from myopathies.
The other part most people don’t realize is that CoQ10 and ubiquinol are lipid-soluble materials biosynthesized in your blood. The carrier is the blood lipid cholesterol. The ubiquinol actually keeps your LDL (often referred to as the “bad” cholesterol) reduced, as it’s an exceptionally potent antioxidant.
Reduced LDL cholesterol isn’t bad cholesterol at all. Only the oxidized version will cause a problem. So by reducing CoQ10 production in your body, you’re also removing the mechanism that keeps your LDL cholesterol from doing harm in your body.
A new finding was published in March 2015, and it is not yet widely known. Research published in Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology revealed that, in contrast to the current belief that cholesterol reduction with statins decreases atherosclerosis, the drugs may instead actually stimulate atherosclerosis and heart failure.
There were several physiological mechanisms discussed in the study that show how statin drugs may make your heart health worse, one being that they inhibit the synthesis of vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 protects your arteries from calcification. Without it, plaque levels worsen.
Vitamin K2’s biological role is to help move calcium into the proper areas in your body, such as your bones and teeth. It also plays a role in removing calcium from areas where it shouldn’t be, such as in your arteries and soft tissues. According to a 2009 Dutch study, vitamin K2 is associated with reduced vascular calcification even at small dietary intakes.
Statin drugs inhibit the function of vitamin K2 in your body, which means taking them may put you at risk of vitamin K2 deficiency, a condition known to contribute to a number of chronic diseases, including:
Statins lower cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme in your liver that produces cholesterol (HMG coenzyme A reductase). Unfortunately this is the same enzyme that produces not only CoQ10 but also ketones, which are crucial nutrients to feed your mitochondria.
Ketones are vitally important biological signaling molecules. There are three ketone bodies, acetoacetate, beta hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. They’re produced in your liver (they’re byproducts of the breakdown of fatty acids) and production increases during fasting. As noted in the journal Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism:
“Ketone bodies are emerging as crucial regulators of metabolic health and longevity, via their ability to regulate HDAC [histone deacetylases] activity and thereby epigenetic gene regulation.” Ketone bodies appear to inhibit HDAC function, which is implicated in the regulation of aging. Further, researchers noted “ketone bodies may link environmental cues such as diet to the regulation of aging.”
Because statins deplete your body of CoQ10, inhibit synthesis of vitamin K2, and reduce the production of ketone bodies, they increase your risk of other serious diseases. This includes:
Research has shown that long-term statin use (10 years or longer) more than doubles women’s risk of two major types of breast cancer: invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma. According to Dr. Sinatra, statins block the squalene pathway (squalene is the precursor to cholesterol), which he believes is essential in preventing breast cancer. In addition, the use of any statin drug, in any amount, was associated with a significantly increased risk for prostate cancer in a separate study, and there was an increasing risk that came along with an increasing cumulative dose. According to a letter to the editor published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology:
“Several cholesterol-lowering drugs, including statins, have been found to be carcinogenic in rodents in doses that produce blood concentrations of the drugs similar to those attained in treating patients. In accordance, breast cancer occurred in 12 of 286 women in the treatment group of the CARE (Cholesterol and Recurrent Events) trial, but only in one of 290 in the placebo group… In the PROSPER (Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) trial, cancer occurred in 245 of 2,891 patients in the treatment group, but only in 199 of 2,913 in the placebo group.
In the SEAS (Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis) trial, cancer occurred in 39 of 944 patients in the treatment group, but only in 23 of 929 in the placebo group…In the two first simvastatin trials, nonmelanoma skin cancer was seen more often as well, and with statistical significance if the results are calculated together… The latter finding may explain the current so-called epidemic of nonmelanoma skin cancer.”
Statins have also been shown to increase your risk of diabetes via a number of different mechanisms. The most important one is that they increase insulin resistance, which can be extremely harmful to your health. Secondly, statins increase your diabetes risk by raising your blood sugar. Statins work by preventing your liver from making cholesterol.
As a result, your liver returns the sugar to your bloodstream, which raises your blood sugar levels. These drugs also rob your body of certain valuable nutrients, which can also impact your blood sugar levels. Two nutrients in particular, vitamin D and CoQ10, are both needed to maintain ideal blood glucose levels. A 2011 meta-analysis confirmed the higher the dosage of statin drugs being taken, the greater the diabetes risk.
The “number needed to harm” for intensive-dose statin therapy was 498 for new-onset diabetes — that’s the number of people who need to take the drug in order for one person to develop diabetes. (13) In even simpler terms, 1 out of every 498 people who are on a high-dose statin regimen will develop diabetes. The following scientific reviews also reached the conclusion that statin use is associated with increased incidence of new-onset diabetes:
A 2010 meta-analysis of 13 statin trials, consisting of 91,140 participants, found that statin therapy was associated with a 9 percent increased risk for incident diabetes. Here, the number needed to harm was 255 over four years, meaning for every 255 people on the drug, one developed diabetes as a result of the drug in that period of time. In a 2009 study, statin use was associated with a rise of fasting plasma glucose in patients with and without diabetes, independently of other factors such as age, and use of aspirin, β-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
The study included data from more than 345,400 patients over a period of two years. On average, statins increased fasting plasma glucose in non-diabetic statin users by 7 mg/dL, and in diabetics, statins increased glucose levels by 39 mg/dL.
Cholesterol is also essential for your brain, which contains about 25 percent of the cholesterol in your body. It is critical for synapse formation, i.e. the connections between your neurons, which allow you to think, learn new things, and form memories. So perhaps it’s not surprising that memory loss is widely reported in association with statin use.
Further, remember that statins reduce ketone production. Ketone bodies are used as fuel by your brain, and they have also demonstrated the capacity to protect against neuronal disease, seizures, and age-related brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s. Researchers from Penn State College of Medicine even found statins were associated with an increased Parkinson’s risk.
High total cholesterol and LDL were also associated with a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease. The study concluded, “Statin use may be associated with a higher PD [Parkinson’s disease] risk, whereas higher total cholesterol may be associated with lower risk.”
Statin users are more likely to suffer from musculoskeletal conditions, injuries and pain than non-users. Myalgia, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, rhabdomyolysis, autoimmune muscle disease, and tendinous diseases have all been reported in association with statin use. One reason for this may be statins’ interference with selenium-containing proteins. Selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidase are crucial for preventing oxidative damage in your muscle tissue. As reported by Wellness Resources:
“Blocking the selenoprotein enzyme glutathione peroxidase is akin to pouring gasoline on the fire of inflammation and free radicals, which damages muscle tissue. In fact, the scientists described this blocking of the selenoproteins reminiscent of selenium deficiency induced heart failure, known as Keshan’s disease first identified in the 1930s.” Further, according to a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine:
“[S]tatin use is associated with an increased likelihood of diagnoses of musculoskeletal conditions, arthropathies, and injuries … Several factors may explain the musculoskeletal AEs [adverse events] of statin therapy, including the inhibitory effect on coenzyme Q10 synthesis, selenoprotein synthesis, and the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
In addition, in vitro studies indicated that statins may affect apoptosis genes; misregulation of apoptosis is associated with myopathy. Pathologic studies also have shown that statin use may be associated with myopathy in the presence of normal creatine kinase levels, even in the absence of symptoms. Statin-associated necrotizing autoimmune myopathy was noted to persist or progress despite cessation of statin therapy.”
An objective review of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane review databases found that for every 10,000 people taking a statin, there were 307 extra patients with cataracts. This was supported by a separate JAMA study, which further revealed that the risk of cataracts is increased among statin users compared with non-users. Cataract is a clouding of your eye lens and is a main cause of low vision among the elderly.
If You Take Statins, Be Sure You Also Take Vitamin K2 And CoQ10
If you decide to take a statin, a vitamin K2 supplement is highly recommended. MK-7 is the form you’ll want to look for in supplements; it’s extracted from the Japanese fermented soy product called natto. Professor Cees Vermeer, one of the world’s top vitamin K2 researchers, recommends between 45 mcg and 185 mcg daily for adults.
You must use caution on the higher doses if you take anticoagulants, but if you are generally healthy and not on these types of medications, I suggest 150 mcg daily. You’ll also need to make sure you take CoQ10 or ubiquinol (the reduced form) with it. One study evaluated the benefits of CoQ10 and selenium supplementation for patients with statin-associated myopathy. (22) Compared to those given a placebo, the treatment group experienced significantly less pain, decreased muscle weakness and cramps, and less fatigue.
How To Protect Your Heart Health
Are you looking for a non-drug way to boost your heart health? Here are some of my top recommendations:
Reduce, with the plan of eliminating, grains and sugars in your diet. It is vitally important to eliminate gluten-containing grains and sugars, especially fructose.
Make sure you are getting plenty of high-quality, animal-based omega-3 fats, such as krill oil. Research suggests that as little as 500 mg of krill per day may improve your total cholesterol and triglycerides and will likely increase your HDL cholesterol.
Replace harmful vegetable oils and synthetic trans fats with healthy fats, such as olive oil, butter and coconut oil (remember olive oil should be used cold only; use coconut oil for cooking and baking).
Include fermented foods in your daily diet. These will not only optimize your intestinal microflora, which will boost your overall immunity, but will also introduce beneficial bacteria into your mouth. Poor oral health is another powerful indicator of increased heart disease risk.
Optimize your vitamin D levels, ideally through appropriate sun exposure as this will allow your body to also create vitamin D sulfate — another factor that may play a crucial role in preventing the formation of arterial plaque.
Exercise regularly. Make sure you incorporate high-intensity interval exercises, which also optimize your human growth hormone (HGH) production.
Be sure to get plenty of high-quality, restorative sleep. Practice regular stress-management techniques.",1

"It’s just so fetch: sitting at the table with the new mean girls.
They are this year’s cool kids: “Mean Girls,” now in a limited tryout run at the National Theatre, is on the shortlist of this season’s anticipated new Broadway musicals. It’s based on the Tina Fey-penned 2004 high school rivalry comedy that is such a cult fave that it has its own day (Oct. 3). The movie’s backstabbing stars included Lindsay Lohan as new girl Cady Heron, Rachel McAdams as vengeful Regina George — queen bee of the clique known as the Plastics — and Amanda Seyfried as the ultra-dim Plastic Karen Smith.
This is the quintet playing the singing and dancing Mean Girls and their outsider nemesis, Janis:
Erika Henningsen as the newbie Cady Heron, whose do-good parents home-schooled her as they worked in Africa; Taylor Louderman as the ultra-manipulative Regina; Ashley Park as Gretchen Wieners, who tries to make “fetch” this year’s “cool”; Kate Rockwell as Karen, the Plastic so vapid that she asks Cady, “If you’re from Africa, why are you white?”; and Barrett Wilbert Weed as goth girl Janis Sarkisian.
Dressed in all black for a photo shoot, the actresses have gathered around a small table upstairs at the National. The rehearsal days are dwindling; the first performance is a week away. All the heavyweights are around somewhere: Fey, still tweaking the book. Fey’s husband, Jeff Richmond, composer for Fey’s television hits “30 Rock” and “The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” writing the music. “Legally Blonde: The Musical” lyricist Nell Benjamin,” penning the lyrics. Director-choreographer Casey Nicholaw, whose musical comedy hits include “The Book of Mormon” and “Something Rotten!” And Lorne Michaels, the “Saturday Night Live” godfather who is a lead producer on this show.
But it will fall to these performers to execute the songs, dances and jokes about cheese fries and carb diets that the “Mean Girls” fan base will be primed to see. Huddling together and laughing a lot, the actresses dish.
Q: What was your relationship to “Mean Girls” before this?
Rockwell: Especially for our age group, it’s a cultural phenomenon. It became ingrained in the way we speak and the -isms we’ve developed. It’s hard for me to imagine not having “Mean Girls.”
Park: “Mean Girls” is the movie I can watch at any time, with anybody.
Henningsen: We were talking about if this is going to be a “Rocky Horror” experience, because everybody knows the lines. People can probably recite more of the scenes verbatim than they even realize.
Park: But they’re not going to know when the lines are coming.
Q: How did “Mean Girls” get this kind of status?
Weed: I’ve never heard anybody be able to articulate or explain down to such minute detail what exactly happens in young female friend groups — the competition, the fighting, needing to be sneaky and needing to appear like you’re a nice person even though you have great anger and things you want to say, but can’t.
Louderman: It feels like the most honest portrayal of life in high school. Tina brought in some young teenagers to watch our run-through, and it’s clear that she listens to that age group. She wanted to hear whether they use Instagram or Snapchat more, whether they use hashtags — what’s in among that crowd.
Rockwell: She’s such an observer. Sometimes when she writes I go, “Yes, that is exactly what we’re doing” — and I didn’t even know I was doing it. I think of the character who says, “I saw Cady Heron wearing army pants and flip flops, so I went out and bought army pants and flip flops.” That’s what we did!
Henningsen: But isn’t high school funny, once you’re out of it? When you think back to the things that mattered so much, you’re like, “Oh, my God.” When you get to look back, you find some joy and ridiculousness.
Weed: It’s retrospective relief. You don’t ever want to feel as weirdly in daily danger as you do when you’re in high school.
Q: How is this different as a musical?
Henningsen: My favorite thing was seeing what they extrapolated on from the movie. They made meals out of those tiny moments by bringing music into it — and Casey Nicholaw’s incredible choreography.
Louderman: It’s fun to watch Tina experiment with different setups — the same sort of joke, but maybe a different line or two. You still get the same sort of vibe, but you get a surprise.
Rockwell: I love that there’s a storytelling perspective change. You get to know some characters in a very different light than you did in the film. I won’t say which ones. But it’s really neat.
Weed: [Fey is] coming at it from a different point in her life. And she has two daughters. So the things being brought into the story now are even deeper and more sensitive.
Park: We’re at our most vulnerable when we’re singing onstage, and when you are able to open up characters through song, it goes perfectly with them being in high school. We just had our sitzprobe yesterday —
Group: Ohhhh! [The sitzprobe is the first time the actors rehearse with the orchestra and get the music’s full effect.]
Park: We were mosh-pitting at the end of it.
Weed: And everybody was crying. [They laugh.] I’ve never watched my director, book writer, lyricist and composer cry at the sound of the music.
Q: How would you describe the music?
Henningsen: It’s not just limited to musical theater. Because it’s set in the modern day, they pulled all these influences from pop, rock, jazz, Africana. My favorite thing was hearing how each character has a different sound. In a show about five women, they wanted to make sure everybody was distinct.
Rockwell: It sounds like Jeff [Richmond], too. It sounds like his voice. If you pay attention to the music he wrote for “30 Rock” and “Kimmy Schmidt,” you’ll hear his voice.
Rockwell: He was here yesterday. He pops in quite a bit.
Weed: His relationship with Tina is so cool to watch. It feels like they’re family. The other day we had a break and she was on her laptop. Some people from “Saturday Night Live” had come to watch a run-through, which was mind-blowing. We had a conversation, and she said, “That reminds me. I have to email Lorne, because I want this character to reappear on SNL.” I was like, “Do you do that often?” She said, “Oh, yeah — any time I want something to happen.” I was like, “Does it always happen?” She said, “Maybe 20 percent.”
Q: So who’s the boss of this?
Rockwell: Casey. In a room where everybody has history and a portfolio of successes — and it’s all big — I’ve been very interested to see. Behind the screen, I don’t know. But the voice of leadership is Casey Nicholaw.
Louderman: He’s the boss. But he’s very collaborative.
Rockwell: He listens to everybody. But at the end of the day, when there’s a question, everyone’s heads turn to him.
Q: What the world wants to hear is mean girls talking smack about Tina Fey.[Laughter.]
Louderman: You would expect her to have that playful quality we see on TV. But really we get that from Jeff. Jeff is silly and quirky. Tina, even when she has something to say to you, she draws you in.
Park: She trusts the people she’s brought in. She trusts us with these characters.
Louderman: But she shouldn’t trust us with her phone.
Weed: She needed to go back into the room quickly, and she said, “Barrett, hold my phone.” I went, “Okay.” Then I said, “Guys guys guys — I have Tina’s phone and it’s unlocked! What do I do?” We just took a thousand pictures on it.
Henningsen: My favorite thing during rehearsals was to watch Tina’s face. Her lips would be moving. She would either be saying the lines with us, or she would want to rewrite and would be saying it to herself. Then on a five-minute break she would come up and say, “Maybe say it like this next time.” She has no ego about the writing. If it doesn’t sound good on our timing, she’s like, “Try it this way.”
Louderman: Jeff does the same thing.
Rockwell: Jeff sings all the songs. And he’ll give a full performance. The other day he was giving a full Regina George performance from his chair. It was so cute!
Park: This is their first musical, and to see how genuinely excited they are is so fun to watch.
Rockwell: Sitzprobe day is music day: Jeff’s day, and Nell’s. Watching Tina congratulate Jeff at the end — we couldn’t even take a photo. I’ve never seen her smile so big. They’re a quiet couple, and there was a quiet moment in the back of that room.
Q: Is it good or treacherous that “Mean Girls” has such a built-in fan base?
Louderman: The expectations are going to be a thing, but I feel really confident that people are going to be pleasantly surprised. I love that the message is a little bit stronger.
Henningsen: Are we allowed to say how she’s added onto that message, about not cutting one another down, but also not apologizing for being a strong woman?
Louderman: Let’s just say we encourage kindness and understanding.
Park: And not everyone’s going to be best friends at the end of high school.
Erika Henningsen (Cady): Raised in California and seen at Arlington’s Signature Theatre as Beth in the 2014 Sheryl Crow-Barry Levinson musical “Diner.” Two years ago, at 23, Henningsen became Broadway’s youngest Fantine in “Les Misérables.”
Taylor Louderman (Regina): Wendy in the recent NBC “Peter Pan Live!” and lately has been playing Lauren in “Kinky Boots” on Broadway. “I’m from Bourbon, Missouri, where spirits are high,” Louderman says, “and where the cattle population exceeds the human population.”
Ashley Park (Gretchen): Born in Southern California and raised in Ann Arbor, Mich. She has been in “Mamma Mia!” and played Tuptim in Lincoln Center’s “The King and I.”
Cincinnati-raised Kate Rockwell (Karen): Broadway credits include “Rock of Ages” and “Legally Blonde”; last year she was Carrie Pipperidge in Arena Stage’s “Carousel.”
Barrett Wilbert Weed (Janis): Veronica in the original Los Angeles “Heathers: The Musical”; she won a Helen Hayes Award as Sally Bowles in Signature’s 2015 “Cabaret.”

"Seven layers of plastic for a bag of chips may seem excessive, but packaging is more complicated than it looks. What are the challenges wrapped around common household products?
Seven layers of plastic for a bag of chips may seem excessive, but packaging is more complicated than it looks. What are the challenges wrapped around common household products?
Environmental sustainability and business don’t always go hand in hand, especially when it comes to product packaging. Some of the most common household packages – including potato chip bags, pizza boxes and toothpaste tubes – often aren’t recyclable. For companies hoping to woo sustainability-minded customers, this can be a real problem. Even though it makes up a small part of a product’s environmental impact (pdf), packaging is the first thing that consumers see, and it can heavily influence their buying decisions.
Mark Dancy, president of WasteZero, a US-based waste reduction company, says that while fast advancing technologies can boost green friendly packaging, many companies continue to commit packaging mistakes. The main problem, he argues, is that, when it comes to packaging, most companies focus on two priorities: “how will this drive consumers to my product and how much does this cost”. For some, environmental sustainability is a third, less important concern. “But realistically, most look at the first two,” he says.
Here are some examples of the top packaging blunders that companies make, as well as some potential solutions to the packaging puzzle.
The problem: The typical snack chip bag is made from up to seven layers of foil and plastic. Companies like this because these bags are light, reduce shipping volume, don’t take up much space on a shelf, and are graphics friendly. The downside is that there’s currently no machinery to separate these layers, so they aren’t recyclable.
“It’s not cost effective and there would be no market for the separated material,” explains Lawrence Black, director of global business development at Waste Management, a US-based environmental solutions provider. “It is expensive to fix and it all comes back to is there a market for the material. If there’s not an ongoing market for the material it won’t get recycled.”
Who does it? Multi-layered packages are popular with consumer giants, particularly snack food manufacturers such as Frito-Lay and PepsiCo.
What is the solution? Unfortunately, there is no easy solution: according to sustainability experts at Waste Management multi-layered packaging is considered the worst of the worst when it comes to recycling. “When things are mixed together, you devalue the product,” says Tom Carpenter, executive director of Waste Management’s sustainability services. “If I had two boxes, and one is all cardboard, the other box had metal strips, the second would be too costly to recycle.”
Consumer education can go a long way toward increasing the potential for recycling. For example, packages with simpler multilayers, such as cereal boxes and bags, need to be separated for recycling. Another option is “upcycling”: Consumers can wash out used bags and reuse them for sandwich bags, or for craft projects, such as the potato chip wallet.
The problem: Size and material are two of the biggest factors for recyclability: in general, the smaller a package and the greater its mix of materials, the less recyclable it is. While consumers and businesses may think that sleek, recyclable containers are sustainable, experts note that single-serving foods, including yogurt and coffee cups, are especially problematic. Their small size and – in the case of yogurt cups, difficult-to-recycle plastic – tend to make them a tough sell for recyclers.
Who does it? Most common single-serve foods, including cups of coffee, violate the material and size rule. Yogurt, especially, is a problem – the majority of yogurt companies, ranging from giants like Dannon and Chobani, to smaller independent producers, use packaging that is difficult to recycle.
What is the solution? On the recycling end, advances in technology could lead to new sorting machines and more sustainable polymers. Alternately, some companies, including Unilever, have redesigned their packaging to make it more sustainable. On the consumer end, many coffee chains, including Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks, allow customers to use reuseable coffee mugs.
Another option is compostable, biodegradable packaging. Some supermarkets, like Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s, are increasingly utilizing compostable and biodegradeable containers. Unfortunately, this is still uncommon. Green-conscious consumers can also opt to purchase larger size items and transport them in reusable or washable containers.
The problem: The small size, blended material and leftover toothpaste inside toothpaste tubes – and other tube-based containers – make recycling almost impossible. As for toothbrushes, their slender shape and blend of plastic and nylon bristles make them tough to disassemble and recycle.
Who does it? Toothpaste and toothbrush manufacturers, including consumer giant Colgate-Palmolive, manufacture these non-recyclable products.
What is the solution? Since being served with a shareholder resolution by As You Sow (AYS) a non-profit environmental protection group in 2012, Colgate-Palmolive has been working with AYS to create a recyclable toothpaste tube or package.
The problem: While plastic bottles, which are popular with both beverage manufacturers and consumers, have come a long way when it comes to recycling, there is still room for improvement when it comes to the percentage of bottles that are recycled.
Who does it? Most beverage manufacturers, including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, use PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic bottles.
What is the solution? In some ways, plastic bottles are a case study in how companies can use innovations and consumer outreach to improve a recycling problem. A 2013 report from the National Association for PET Container Resources showed that New York’s bottle deposit law and a rise in collections in California drove up US gross recycling rates of PET bottles to 30.8%.
But there is still room for improvement, and companies, including both Coca-Cola and Pepsico, have launched programs to make recycling more efficient and convenient. Venues where plastic bottles are consumed have also gotten involved. Earlier this year, the National Resource Defense Council released the “Guide to Composting at Sports Venues,” and many of the US’s major sports arenas and venues have established food composting programs and replaced their trash cans with recycling bins.
Some companies are also building recyclability into the product itself. For example, Pepsico’s popular “Naked” beverage comes in a 100% post-consumer recycled plastic bottle. Similarly, Vermont-based Seventh Generation’s eco-friendly products are packaged in green friendly, post-consumer containers.
The problem: Companies and private sellers that deliver products through the mail often over-package, putting a pre-boxed item in a second box, and sometimes even a third one. This practice, which Dancy calls the “Russian doll” approach, is exceedingly wasteful.
Who does it? Sellers on the eCommerce network, including eBay.
What is the solution? One option is to use sustainable packing materials, rather than the traditional styrofoam. There are numerous sustainable options, including packing materials made from corn starch or sorghum, which can be composted. And New York-based Ecovative design has developed fungus-based packing materials that are being used by Dell, Crate and Barrel and Puma, among others.
Ed Kastenbaum, general manager of San Francisco-based The Packaging Store, and vice president of the Retail Packaging Association, packs with recycled pulp instead of Styrofoam when selling to wine shippers. Kastenbaum says that the pulp wine shippers are widely available. The market change started more than 10 years ago & now the vast majority of wine is shipped in this manner by wineries, wine clubs, and wine retailers.
The problem: Pizza boxes – and many other takeout containers – are made of recyclable materials, but when cheese or other food scraps stick to the cardboard, they are no longer recyclable.
Who does it? Consumers and food delivery places.
What is the solution? Consumer awareness and letting consumers know that the box is valuable. Although consumers and yes pizza companies can’t avoid the take-out pizza with cheese attached to lid, some companies have turned to environmentally friendly solutions including using compostable containers and specially designed recyclable-friendly pizza boxes.
Some pizza companies such as Straw Hat Pizza separate food and compostable materials in the restaurants. East coast-based Skinny Pines Brick Oven Caterer use innovative packages such as The Green Box, a recyclable pizza box that can be disassembled to making it recyclable friendly.

"While both cottage cheese and flaxseed are both very nutritional on their own, the combination of the two are believed by some to contain extremely powerful healing properties. Some specialists, like the German bio-chemist Johanna Budwig, believe it can even curecancer. Now to be clear, the data that stems from this claim is straight out of the 1950’s, as is the Budwig diet itself. Today, the Budwig diet is not recommended as a treatment forcancer. However, the combination of cottage cheese and flaxseed may still prove worthy forcancerpatients as well as all of us.
Being an expert in fats and lipids, Dr. Budwig noticed in her research that many of the modern processed fats and hydrogenated oils are destroying the membranes of our cells. The destruction of the outer layers of the cells make things like fat absorption hard or impossible for our cells. This causes the destruction and/or cellular toxicity. The idea behind the Budwig diet is that it would repair the damages made to cellular membranes and eliminate further damage.
Dr. Budwig was born in Germany in 1908. She passed away in 2003 at the age of 95. She has been referred to as a top European cancer research scientist, biochemist, blood specialist, German pharmacologist, and physicist. Dr. Budwig was a seven-time Nobel Prize nominee.
In Germany in 1952, she was the central government’s senior expert for fats and pharmaceutical drugs. She’s considered one of the world’s leading authorities on fats and oils. Her research has shown the tremendous effects that commercially processed fats and oils have in destroying cell membranes and lowering the voltage in the cells of our bodies, which then result in chronic and terminal disease. What we have forgotten is that we are body electric.
The cells of our body fire electrically. They have a nucleus in the center of the cell which is positively charged, and the cell membrane, which is the outer lining of the cell, is negatively charged. We are all aware of how fats clog up our veins and arteries and are the leading cause of heart attacks, but we never looked beyond the end of our noses to see how these very dangerous fats and oils are affecting the overall health of our minds and bodies at the cellular level.
Dr. Budwig discovered that when unsaturated fats have been chemically treated, their unsaturated qualities are destroyed and the field of electrons removed. This commercial processing of fats destroys the field of electrons that the cell membranes (60-75 trillion cells) in our bodies must have to fire properly (i.e. function properly).
The fats’ ability to associate with protein and thereby to achieve water solubility in the fluids of the living body—all this is destroyed. As Dr. Budwig put it, “the battery is dead because the electrons in these fats and oils recharge it.” When the electrons are destroyed the fats are no longer active and cannot flow into the capillaries and through the fine capillary networks. This is when circulation problems arise.
Without the proper metabolism of fats in our bodies, every vital function and every organ is affected. This includes the generation of new life and new cells. Our bodies produce over 500 million new cells daily. Dr. Budwig points out that in growing new cells, there is a polarity between the electrically positive nucleus and the electrically negative cell membrane with its high unsaturated fatty acids. During cell division, the cell, and new daughter cell must contain enough electron-rich fatty acids in the cell’s surface area to divide off completely from the old cell. When this process is interrupted the body begins to die. In essence, these commercially processed fats and oils are shutting down the electrical field of the cells allowing chronic and terminal diseases to take hold of our bodies.
A very good example would be tumors. Dr. Budwig noted that “The formation of tumors usually happens as follows. In those body areas which normally host many growth processes, such as in the skin and membranes, the glandular organs, for example, the liver and pancreas or the glands in the stomach and intestinal tract—it is here that the growth processes are brought to a stand still. Because the polarity is missing, due to the lack of electron rich highly unsaturated fat, the course of growth is disturbed—the surface-active fats are not present; the substance becomes inactive before the maturing and shedding process of the cells ever takes place, which results in the formation of tumors.”
She pointed out that this can be reversed by providing the simple foods, cottage cheese, andflax seed oil, which revises the stagnated growth processes. This naturally causes the tumor or tumors present to dissolve and the whole range of symptoms which indicate a “dead battery are cured.” Dr. Budwig did not believe in the use of growth-inhibiting treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. She was quoted as saying “I flat declare that the usual hospital treatments today, in a case of tumorous growth, most certainly leads to worsening of the disease or a speedier death, and in healthy people, quickly causes cancer.”
Dr. Budwig discovered that when she combinedflaxseed oil, with its powerful healing nature of essential electron rich unsaturated fats, and cottage cheese, which is rich in sulfur protein, the chemical reaction produced makes the oil water soluble and easily absorbed into the cell membrane.
Here are the ingredients to make the Budwig Diet and how to mix them together.
This is generally purchased at a health food store. For people who do not live near a health food store, they can order it over the Internet. Even if it takes a few days of travel to arrive at your house, leaving it unrefrigerated for this period should not affect the product. But after it arrives refrigerate it.
The most popular brand isBarlean’s Flax Oil, but there are other brands. The key is that it is liquid and has far more omega 3s than omega 6s. For example, my bottle (Barlean’s) has 6,200 mg of omega 3s to 1,810 mg of omega 6s. The reason for this ratio is that a normal diet will have far more omega 6 than omega 3, thus the supplement must have far more omega 3 than omega 6.
One main issue is “lignans.” Lignans are particles which contain fiber. Some people claim you should buy non-lignan versions offlax oiland some people suggest you buy high lignan varieties.
The answer really depends on what you are using it for. For example, if you are using it for stomach cancer, and are on the Cellect-Budwig protocol or Bill Henderson protocol, then you definitely need the “high lignan” version. This is because the stomach needs the fiber.
On the other hand, Mike Vrentas recommends no lignin varieties for other types of cancer patients. However, his reason is that it is hard to tell when the lignan version becomes rancid. This is generally not an issue in high volume health food stores.
What you use is up to you and your research.
Shake the flaxseed oil well before putting it in the bowl.
Here are the basic instructions on how to make the Budwig Mixture.
Grind with a small coffee grinder (1) Tbsp of Flax Seed and put in a small bowl. Do not buy pre-ground flax seed as the flax seed goes rancid 15 minutes after grinding. Brown or Golden whole Flaxseed is available and either will work. Grind fresh each time.
We have always recommended using the immersion [stick or wand like] mixer for theFlax Seed Oiland Cottage Cheese. Here is a link to immersion mixers:
Immersion Mixer Vendor
Mix (4) Tbs of organic 2% low fat Cottage Cheese with (2) Tbs organic cold pressed Flax Seed Oil commonly referred to as (Flax Oil). It is best (not) to use Flavored, Lignum or Highest Lignum Flax Oil. Two good flax oils are Barlean’s or Spectrum’s cold pressed organic flax oil. This can be found in the refrigerated section of the grocery or health food store. Never off the shelf. Never capsule or flakes. Watch the expiration date. Blend the flax oil and cottage cheese together with theimmersion blenderuntil reaching a creamy quality and the oil has been absorbed. There should be no standing oil.
Then add to this mixture if needed, 1-3 Tbs of low-fat milk for a creamier mixture and (stir with a spoon) no blender. This mixture should then be poured over the freshly ground flax seed and mixed together by spoon; again no blender. The ratio may be adjusted for smaller or larger proportions. A rule of thumb to keep in mind is one tablespoon of oil to two tablespoons of cottage cheese. The amount of milk can be adjusted as needed for consistency and easier blending. Once the mixture is completed it must be eaten immediately for best results. Make fresh each time.
The above mixture can be flavored differently every day by adding nuts, preferably organic such as pecans, almonds or walnuts (not peanuts), banana, organic cocoa, shredded coconut, pineapple (fresh) blueberries, raspberries, cinnamon, vanilla or (freshly) squeezed fruit juice. It’s usually best to place the fresh fruit on top of the completed mixture and enjoy as its own meal. Try your best to obtain organic fruit when possible. Many times this can be found frozen when not in season.
Each brand of cinnamon has an oil content. For diabetic patients it is critical to go to a health food store and buy the highest percentage of oil as possible. Cinnamon mimics insulin, thus by adding cinnamon you may need less insulin immediately.
The sole purpose of this item is for taste, thus add whatever fruits you wish.
You must consume the Budwig mixture within 20 minutes of making it. Do not make more than you need and do not refrigerate the leftovers.
Also, don’t forget to put the cottage cheese into the bowl first, then the flaxseed oil. Then mix the two together before putting anything else in the bowl.",1
"Apple Inc., seeking a breakthrough product to succeed the iPhone, aims to have technology ready for an augmented-reality headset in 2019 and could ship a product as early as 2020.
Unlike the current generation of virtual reality headsets that use a smartphone as the engine and screen, Apple’s device will have its own display and run on a new chip and operating system, according to people familiar with the situation. The development timeline is very aggressive and could still change, said the people,who requested anonymity to speak freely about a private matter.
While virtual reality immerses the user in a digital world, augmented realityoverlays images and data on the real one. The applications for AR are endless, from a basketball fan getting stats while watching a game to a mechanic streaming instructions on how to fix a specific piece of equipment. Apple isn’t the only company working on the technology. Google, which drew derision for $1,500 smart glasses a few years ago, is developing a business-oriented variant. Startup Meta has developed a headset with a focus on education and medical uses.
Apple Chief Executive OfficerTim Cook considers AR less isolating than VR and as potentially revolutionary as the smartphone. He has talked up the technology on Good Morning America and gives it as almost much attention during earnings calls as sales growth. “We’re already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn,” he said in the most recent call. “Put simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever.”
The company began putting together a team to work on AR-related projectsa couple of years ago, Bloomberg reported in March.Led by Mike Rockwell, who previously ran engineering at Dolby Labs, the group has now grown to several hundred engineers from across Apple, the people said. Scattered across office parks in both Cupertino and Sunnyvale, California, the team is working on several hardware and software projects under the umbrella code name of “T288.”
The team’s first product was ARKit, tools that outside software developers use to create AR applications for the latest iPhones and iPads, leveraging their screens, cameras and processors to create virtual 3-D interfaces for online shopping, education and gaming. This was an interim step, giving Apple an opportunity to test the technology on an existing product.
The next step --creating a headset with a built-in display capable of streaming 3D video without draining the battery -- is much more complicated. Cook acknowledged as much in a recent interview with The Independent, when he said: “Anything you would see on the market any time soon would not be something any of us would be satisfied with.”Referring to challenges creating displays, Chief Design Officer Jony Ive told a tech panel last month that “there are certain ideas that we have and we are waiting for the technology to catch up with the idea.”
As with previous products, Apple isn’t waiting around for someone else to create a chip capable of powering its AR headset. It’s designing one in-house that’s similar in concept to the “system-on-a-package” component in the Apple Watch. Such chips can squeeze more components -- graphics processors, AI chip, CPU -- into a smaller area than standard processors; they also consume less power.
The new operating system, internally dubbed “rOS” for “reality operating system,” is based on iOS, the iPhone’s operating system. Just as tvOS powers the Apple TV, macOS runs on Macs and watchOS runs on Apple Watches, “rOS” will power Apple’s AR headset. Geoff Stahl, formerly a software manager for games and graphics at Apple, is one of the directors of the “rOS” software group.
Apple hasn’t finalized how users will control the headset and launch apps, but is investigating touch panels, voice-activation via Siri and head gestures. Engineers are prototyping a range of applications, from mapping and texting to more advanced features including virtual meeting rooms and 360-degree video playback. The company has discussed pairing the headset with its own version of the App Store, where users would be able to download content, just as they do with the iPhone, Watch, Apple TV and Mac.
Because Apple doesn’t have a fully operational headset of its own, engineers have begun using HTC Vive headsets for testing purposes. They’re also working on a device similar to an Oculus Gear VR headset that uses an iPhone’s screen, cameras and chipsets. Apple doesn’t plan to sell the gadget but instead aims to use it internally to test AR apps next year.
For more on Apple, check out theDecrypted podcast:
With the headset at least two years away, Apple wants to make it easier for developers to bring new AR features to the iPhone. To that end, the company plans to release a new version of ARKit software tools as soon as 2018. They could help developers create software that remembers accurately where a digital object was placed in a virtual space, using a technology called persistent tracking; you look away, and the object is still there. The tools will also make it easier to create AR games for multiple players.",0
"Can Japanese sweet potatoes take the place of a plastic surgeon? Actor Olivia Munn thinks so.
Perhaps looking to deflect recent speculation that she’s had cosmetic work done, the “X-Men: Apocalypse” star took to Instagram Tuesday to reveal the secret behind her radical change of appearance.
“Japanese potatoes … help keep wrinkles away,” she wrote.
Munn has said she eats a baked one every day. The purple tuber, known as satsuma-imo, is similar to a regular sweet potato, high in antioxidants and healthier than a white potato. The satsuma-imo trumps the Idaho white with fewer carbs (24 grams vs. 37 grams) and calories (113 vs. 170). But a beauty secret?
While some anti-aging products cost upwards of $1,000, Olivia Munn‘s age-defying skin secret can be purchased at the supermarket for just a few dollars. The 34-year-old Newsroom actress keeps her skin line-free with a secret potato recipe that actually isn’t too difficult to prepare . You can “Enjoy watching those lines on your face disappear!” after roasting Satsumaimo Japanese sweet potatoes with olive oil and cinnamon.
You can order them from Japanese markets. They also come in pill form, which I tired but I really didn’t see much of a difference. Taking the actual food substance makes a huge difference.
1. Preheat oven to 400 F.
2. Slice the sweet potato into 1-inch thick rounds and place on a baking sheet.
Drizzle each slice with extra virgin olive oil on both sides and sprinkle the top with cinnamon.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the bottom of each slice is golden brown.
Boil your sweet potato until it falls apart easily when you stick a fork in it (about 15-20 minutes). Strain out the water (reserve some sweet potato water, if you’d like, and rinse your face with it once a day for the next 3 days – bonus!). Place all ingredients into a food processor or blender and let it run until the mask is very smooth. This mask has an exceptional texture – PERFECT for a food-on-your-face mask that doesn’t fall off, drip, or otherwise make a mess.
Slather the mask onto a freshly washed face. Leave the mask on for 15-20 minutes. Rinse well, scrubbing lightly with a washcloth.
Finish by smoothing on a VERY light layer of olive oil over your face – just makes the entire experience heavenly!
Shelf life: None – refrigerate up to 3 days
Get Your Hyaluronic Acid
I’m really big on hyaluronic acid, it’s so important. It’s something that we develop in our body and as we get older it starts to diminish like with collagen. But unlike collagen, its only purpose is to carry water to the parts of your body that need it. I started eating these special potatoes that are high in hyaluronic acid.
Hyaluronic acid, with its remarkable ability to keep tissue moist, is particularly effective in treating wrinkles and dry skin. It maintains skin elasticity and even speeds up the healing process for wounds and scars. Hyaluronic acid is also believed to promote healthy eyes and heart valve function. The body’s hyaluronic acid levels decrease with age. In theory, sustaining optimal hyaluronic acid levels could retard the aging process, prolong a youthful appearance, and sustain life.
Connective tissues of humans and animals contain Hyaluronic acid. It plays a key role in cushioning and lubricating the body and is abundant in the eyes, joints and heart valves. A powerful antioxidant, hyaluronic acid is perhaps best known for its ability to bond water to tissue. Since the beginning of time, people have been searching for an effective way to reverse the aging process. Hyaluronic acid is seen by many to be the Fountain of Youth, and there are plenty of natural sources available to make it part of a healthy diet.
Think of it this way:
Your body needs a variety of ingredients in the right proportions to function, just like you need a variety of ingredients to make a cake. If you are making a cake and you are short on eggs, it’s okay to add more eggs, up to a certain amount. If you are not short on eggs, then just adding more eggs is going to ruin your cake. If you are short on flour but not eggs, but you keep adding more eggs but no extra flour, you are really going to end up with a mess.
It’s the same basic principle with your body, only on a larger and much more complex scale. Some people might have defective collagen because they are short on vitamin C. For those people, getting extra vitamin C in their diets would probably be good. But taking massive doses of vitamin C, especially if a person isn’t deficient in vitamin C to begin with, probably isn’t a good thing.
Hyaluronic acid (also called Hyaluronan) is a component of connective tissue whose function is to cushion and lubricate. Hyaluronan occurs throughout the body in abundant amounts in many of the places people with hereditary connective tissue disorders have problems such as joints, heart valves and eyes.Hyaluronic acid fastens onto our collagen and elastin and creates cartilage. It’s found in every tissue of our body, and is responsible for carrying out a number of vital functions.
Hyaluronic acid has become especially popular in both the medical and cosmetic fields. Medical professionals are employing HA to alleviate conditions like arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, dry eyes and pain associated with joint damage. It has also been effective in increasing mobility, alertness, sleep quality, muscle strength, sexual potency, wound healing and bone density. A majority of medical treatments that employ HA are obtained from rooster combs. Rooster combs are considered to contain the most potent variety of HA and are administered via injections.Hyaluronic acid abnormalities are a common thread in connective tissue disorders. Interestingly, they are also common biochemical anomalies in most of the individual features of connective tissue disorders such as mitral valve prolapse, TMJ, osteoarthritis, and keratoconus.
Soy
Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens–plant sources of estrogen that act like estrogen in your body. Estrogen helps your body produce more hyaluronic acid. Consume soybean foods such as tofu, tempeh, soy cheese and soy milk.
Scientists at the Yakult Central Institute for Microbiological Research in Japan revealed soy milk extracts fermented with bifidobacterium (a “friendly bacteria”) significantly enhanced the production of HA when applied topically on the skin for two weeks. This did not work with unfermented soy milk extracts.
Animal Parts
According to Harvey Blatt’s 2008 book “America’s food: what you don’t know about what you eat”: “The red combs of roosters and hens are one of the world’s richest sources for the sugar molecule hyaluronan, a compound some doctors are calling the next big thing after Botox for removing wrinkles.”Aside from red combs, animal parts such as joints and tendons are rich in hyaluronic acid, as are human joints and tendons. Make a broth or stew of animal joints, bones, tendons and skin. Chicken soup made with chicken legs and feet is an ideal HA source.
Red Wine
Resveratrol, found in the skins of grapes and red wine, helps stimulate hyaluronic acid in your body.
In 1997, researchers at Northwestern University Medical School learned that resveratrol in red wine, highly concentrated in grape skin, is a phytoestrogen. Drink red wine or red grape juice to increase estrogen, which produces more hyaluronic acid in your body.
Starchy Root Vegetables
In November 2000, a ABC News Prime Time Live program revealed something interesting about the people of Yuzuri Hara, Japan, called the “village of long life.” They all have smooth, wrinkle-free skin, good eyesight, health and energy. And, as I said earlier, live well into their 80s and 90s. The people of Yuzuri Hara grow and eat starchy root vegetables, which stimulate the body to produce hyaluronic acid, including a small sweet-potato-like vegetable called “tamaji.”
Studies at Research & Development, Beiersdorf AG in Hamburg, Germany, revealed success using Arctium lappa (A. lappa) fruit extract to reduce signs of aging. A. lappa, which contains hyaluronic acid, was part of a formula and applied topically. After 4 weeks, the crow’s feet wrinkles were “significantly reduced.” Scientists concluded A. lappa effectively regenerates the skin structures to reduce wrinkles.
Magnesium is needed in the body to synthesize hyaluronic acid, so consuming foods rich in magnesium, like avocados, broccoli, peanuts, potatoes, soy and spinach can keep hyaluronic acid levels from dropping too low.
Estrogen and hyaluronic acid have somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. When the level of one rises, so does the level of the other. Soy products, like tofu and soy beans, have been shown to increase estrogen levels, making them an indirect source for hyaluronic acid.
Zinc deficiencies seem to coincide with low hyaluronic acid. Consuming brown rice, peanuts, potatoes, pumpkin seeds and other zinc-rich foods could alleviate the problem.
Does it come in supplement form?
Essentially, hyaluronic acid is a dietary supplement said to reduce the accumulation of fluid and decrease inflammation in the joints and connective tissues of the body. Typically, it is found in tabletform and taken in a 40 or 50 milligram dosage twice a day, but can be given hypodermically to the affect area. The tablets are not a prescription medication, so bottles of hyaluronic acid can pretty much be found anywhere that sells vitamins and supplements, this would include pharmacies, big box stores and supplement dealers like GNC and Vitamin World.
Researchers at the University of California San Francisco have discovered abnormally high levels of hyaluronic acid could contribute to tumor progression in breast cancer. The University of Minnesota’s Department of Surgery has found similar results regarding colon cancer.
While a number of studies have linked abnormal levels of HA to either connective tissue disorders (CTDs) or conditions common in CTDs, such as premature aging, there are also a number of studies on Pubmed noting associations of high levels of HA to some forms of cancer. With HA as with other substances in the human body, such as estrogen and cholesterol, there are most likely optimal levels, and disease often occurs when these levels become out of range in either direction. Low estrogen levels have been linked to bone loss, while high estrogen levels have been associated with breast cancer. High cholesterol levels have been linked to heart attacks and stroke, while low levels have been linked to bleeding problems and depression. HA has been studied less than either cholesterol or estrogen, but the prudent path would be to assume that the body has optimal levels of HA, as it does for cholesterol, estrogen and many other substances.
As such, it is always prudent to consult your doctor before you decide to take HA or any other type of supplement to make sure it is an appropriate treatment for your particular health condition.",1

Blackheads are actually clogged pores due to the appearance of excess oil, produced by the oil glands – sebaceous glands. This excess oil results from the hormonal changes within the body like pregnancy and menstruation, then from the excess consumption of fried foods, excessive use of oil based cosmetic products and so on. They commonly appear on the nose and on the face, even though in some cases on the back as well.
On the market, there are many blackhead removal products, but we cannot be ever sure about the ingredients they contain as most of them are based on chemicals which can do more harm than good. Therefore you should always opt for the natural methods which are safe for use.
Natural and Fast Method of Getting Rid of Blackheads
All you have to do is to follow these three steps:
STEP 1: STEAM FACIAL
You need to start with steam facial, and for that purpose boil water and leave it to cool off for a while. Next, pour this boiled water on a small face towel, and use it to clean the face areas where you are having blackheads. The use of this soaked towel will help you to open up the pores thus making it easier to extract the blackheads.
STEP 2: EXFOLIATE
For this step you will need the following ingredients:
Toothbrush
Toothpaste
Salt
Bowl
Take the bowl and squeeze in it some of the toothpaste and then add salt. Mix all the ingredients with a toothbrush. Use this mixture to scrub your nose by using the toothbrush, but do it gently, you are not supposed to overdo it, do it only for 2 minutes. In the end, rinse it off with normal tap water.
STEP 3: DEEP CLEANSING AND BLACKHEAD REMOVAL
For the final step you will need ingredients like yogurt, lemon juice and Multani Mitti.
The content of lactic acid in yogurt will soften the skin, making it supple. On the other hand, the citric acid in lemon juice cleanses your skin thereby making it brighter and meanwhile regulating the amount of oil you produce in your skin. And finally, the Multani Mitti absorbs the excess oil, improves skin elasticity, and eliminates dead skin cells and blackheads.
Recipe for deep cleansing and blackhead removal
2 tablespoons of Multani Mitti(Fuller’s Earth)
2 tablespoons of yoghurt
1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice
Preparation: Start with combining all the ingredients well, but adding the lemon juice in the end. Mix everything well in order to form a paste. If it is by any chance too thick, include in it some more lemon juice. Use this mixture and apply a thick layer of it on your blackheads. Leave it to stand like that for 15 – 20 minutes, and once it is completely dried out, rinse it off with cool water.

"For the pastry, sift the flour, sugar, salt, ginger and cinnamon into a large bowl. Add the butter and, working quickly, rub the mixture together between your thumb and forefinger until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.
Turn onto a very lightly floured work surface. Gently and quickly knead the dough until it becomes smooth. Flatten the dough into a disc and wrap in cling film. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or freeze for 10 minutes.
Once the pastry has chilled, roll it out thinly on a lightly floured surface. Lift the dough into the tart tin and press into the edges. Leave any excess overhanging the sides of the tart tin. Prick the base with a fork and line with baking paper. Fill with baking beans or uncooked rice and chill again for 10 minutes.
For the filling, add the juice and zest of the grapefruits to a large saucepan. Add the ginger and bring to the boil. Simmer for 10 minutes, then strain to remove the ginger and set the juice aside to cool.
In a separate heatproof bowl, add the yolks, eggs, sugar, cornflour and salt. Whisk to combine then set the bowl over a pan of gently simmering water (do not allow the water to touch the bowl). Pour in the grapefruit juice and whisk the mixture for about 15 minutes, or until it starts to thicken. Add the butter piece by piece, whisking all the time for about 15 minutes, or until the mixture is very thick. (If the mixture is taking too long to thicken, transfer the mixture to a pan and heat gently until thick.) Place some cling film on the surface of the curd to prevent a skin forming and set aside.
Remove the pastry from the fridge, place the tin on a baking tray and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the baking beans and greaseproof paper. Brush the base well with beaten egg and bake for another 7–10 minutes, or until the pastry is dry and pale golden-brown. Set aside to cool in the tin, then using a sharp knife cut away the overhanging edge.
While the sugar and water is being heated, use a paper towel to rub the inside of the bowl of a freestanding mixer with the lemon juice (this will remove any traces of grease that can cause meringues to fail). Add the egg whites to the bowl and whisk on a medium speed until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.
Once the sugar syrup has reached 230F on a sugar thermometer, remove it from the heat. With the motor running on the mixer, pour the syrup slowly down the side of the bowl. Once the syrup has all been added, increase the speed to high and whisk for about 7–9 minutes, or until the bowl is cool to the touch and the meringue has stiff peaks.
To assemble the tart, remove the cling film on the curd and gently reheat, if required. Once the curd is warm, pour into the pastry case and smooth the surface.
Spoon the meringue into a large piping bag fitted with a large open star nozzle. Pipe the meringue in swirls on top of the curd and then finish by browning the meringue with a chef’s blowtorch.",0
"LAS VEGAS – ConorMcGregor and Floyd Mayweather have finally reached a multi-million dollar deal to fight.
After months of intense negotiations, representatives for The Notorious have thrashed out a money-spinning contract with ‘Money’ Mayweather’s camp in recent days.
A post shared by Conor McGregor Official (@thenotoriousmma) on
Although the bombshell agreement is yet to be formally signed because of a third party hold-up, it means the 28-year-old Crumlin brawler will go toe-to-toe with the undefeated 39-year-old boxing great.
The Sun exclusively revealed last year that McGregor and Mayweather were in talks over a sensational boxing match.
And we can now revealthatthe MMA sensation pulled out of a scheduled meet-and-greet event in Dublin this week to go to the States to make an anti-bullying video for schoolchildren.
McGregor will shoot the video as part of a deal struck with the Nevada Sport Commission after he was deemed to have thrown a bottle of water at Nate Diaz.
He will also use the opportunity to finalise details with his representatives in Las Vegas as the blockbuster Mayweather fight inches closer.
In a previous live interview event in Manchester, the Notorious revealed that he would be jetting out to Vegas to settle his score with the Nevada Sport Commission.
He said: “There’s a lot of business to do out in Las Vegas. They tried to fine me $150,000 for throwing a bottle of water. It was a can but whatever. We’ll call it a bottle of water and say no more about it…
“Ah no look I’m gonna f*** this whole sh*t up again. I love the Vegas commission. We’ve come to an understanding. I’m gonna fly out there and fix it. I’m gonna get my Las Vegas boxing commission and then we’ll see where the f*** Floyd’s at?!”
The undisputed UFC lightweight champion was due to appear at the 100-a-head bash on Friday night, but withdrew todaydue to “an unavoidable schedule change”.
A post shared by Conor McGregor Official (@thenotoriousmma) on
A source close to the Straight Blast Gym star told the Irish Sun: “Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather have agreed a deal to fight and have both settled on their respective fees.
“The contract hasn’t officially been signed yet because of a third party hold-up but all the details have all been agreed on.
“The fight could even be announced within two weeks.”
A spokesman for the hotel said in a statement: “The Red Cow Moran Hotel in association with Industry Entertainment regret to announce that the evening event with Conor McGregor scheduled for Friday 17th February has been cancelled due to circumstances beyond their control.",1
"Just as extremely high temperatures can be harmful to people, the heat can be hard on an animal's health, too.
""People can wear shorts and light clothes, but a dog still has on its fur coat,"" Dr. Karl Jandrey, associate professor of clinical small animal emergency and critical care at the University of California, Davis, told CBS News.
Moderate heat stroke can occur in dogs when their body temperature reaches 104 to 106 degrees F.
""Normal body temperature for most dogs is 100 to 102.5 degrees, so this can happen very easily in extreme heat with activity. Heat stroke in dogs is a very terrible disease,"" Jandrey said. ""The high body temperatures break down their proteins and disrupt cellular function and impairs their brain function. Usually over 108 to 110 degrees these patients rarely survive.""
In extreme heat, he recommends dogs avoid high levels of physical activity for extended periods of time, such as going for a run or hike with their owner. Dogs who are outside  during a heat wave should have access to plenty of water to drink and be hosed down regularly to stay cool.
Hot sidewalks or pavement can also burn dogs' paws, so walk them on the grass if possible or put dog booties on their feet.
And of course, never leave your pet in a car unattended.",0
"Regular marijuana usershave about 20 percent more sex than abstainers, according to a new study from researchers at Stanford University.
The study analyzed data on 28,000female and 23,000 maleparticipants in the National Survey of Family Growth, a nationally representative CDC survey of Americans age 15 to 49.It found that women who smoked marijuana daily had sex with a male partner an average of 7.1 times per month, compared to 6 times per month for nonsmoking women.
Similarly, men who used marijuana daily reported having sex with a woman 6.9 times per month, compared to 5.6 times for nonusers.
Those findings held true even after the researchers controlled for a number of demographic variables known to affect sex habits and marijuana use. “The overall trend we saw applied to people of both sexes and all races, ages, education levels, income groups and religions, every health status, whether they were married or single and whether they had kids,”author Michael Eisenberg said in a statement.
Further bolstering the findings, the study also found what researchers call a “dose-dependent relationship” between marijuana use and sex frequency:as respondents' marijuana use rates increased, so did their frequency of having sex.
The study does not, however, necessarily indicate a causal relationship between marijuana use and sex. “It doesn't say if you smoke more marijuana, you'll have more sex,” Eisenberg said.For instance, people who are naturally inclined to have more frequent sex may be predisposed to marijuana use, rather than the other way around.
Nevertheless, it does seem plausible that a causal effect could be at work here.Somequalitative researchpublished in 2016,for instance, found that respondents generally said that stoned sex was more pleasurable than drunk or sober sex. A 2003 studyalso found that over half of marijuana users said the drug was a libido-booster,compared to 26 percent who said it inhibited their sex drive.
“In humans, sex is not only a means to procreation but serves as an important source of physical pleasure and expression of emotional intimacy,” the Stanford authors write. As such, a fair amount of other research has found a link between the frequency of sex and overall physical and mental health. People who have more sex, on average, arehappier andless stressed, they have lower blood pressure, and better cardiovascular health overall.
This underscores a key point about drug use. We all know the risks associated with marijuana use — dependency, impaired driving, decreased academic performance, etc. But when discussing drug policy we rarely talk about thebenefits of drug use.
That's partly by design: for decades, research into drug use has been focused almost uniformly on drugs' detrimental effects. This bias is baked into the very names of the institutions that fund much of this research — it's why we have a National Institute on DrugAbuse, rather than a National Institute on DrugUse.
For pot in particularwe're just now starting to understand some of the potential benefits of the drug, including euphoriaandrelaxation,pain relief, lower rates of opiate dependence and domestic violence, decreased use of more harmful drugs, and, apparently, better sexual health.
But policymakers' discussions of how and whether to regulate drugs like marijuana rarely take those benefits into consideration.",0

"We all know that if we want to improve our health, the first thing we need to do is change our diet!Even though everyone has heard of this, the fast-food lovers and sugary-treat fanatics are yet to be convinced. They might have heard of the consequences their favorite foods cause to their bodies, but they continue diving in their high-fat, high-sugar foods, without giving it a second thought.
Nature Medicine recently confirmed that foods containing processed sugar are the main reason behind the growth and spread ofcancertumors. In fact, the results were so conclusive, that futurecancerscreening may rely on scanning the body for accumulated sugar for signs of the disease.
This discovery was made after the University College London (UCL) in the U. K. experimented with a newcancer detection method that involves utilizing a unique form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The scientists sensitized a MRI scanner to look specifically for glucose in the body, and it revealed thatcancertumors – which have been proven to feed off sugar – light up brightly as they contain high amounts of sugar.
Explained by a recent UCL announcement,“The new technique, called ‘glucose chemical exchange saturation transfer’ (glucoCEST), is based on the fact that tumors consume much more glucose (a type of sugar) than normal, healthy tissues in order to sustain their growth.”The university gave an update saying that the tumors appear as “bright images” on the scanner.
When traditionally scanning forcancer, the presence of tumors is identified by using low-dose radiation injections because radiation is another known cause ofcancer. But such an injection is not the best choice due to itspotential side effects. However, this method is effective because the things that activate and encouragecancercells to expand and multiply can also be used by doctors to detect it inside the body. And now, sugar can be officially added to that list.
“The method uses an injection of normal sugar and could offer a cheap, safe alternative to existing methods for detecting tumors, which require the injection of radioactive material,”says Dr. Simon Walker-Samuel, lead researcher of the study from the UCL Center for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI).
The study’s senior author reported that it was shocking to discover that the glucoCEST method could effectively identify the presence of tumors only by using the amount of sugar that can be found in “half a standard sized chocolate bar.” This finding is astonishing, as it suggests that even moderately low amounts of sugar have the potential to promotecancerproliferation.
UCL is not the first source to link processed sugar with diseases likecancer. Dr. Robert H. Lustig, M. D. and Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), cites that sugar consumption causes most of thechronic illnessesprevalent today. Lustig is a famed author of “Sugar: The Bitter Truth”, and he describes his findings in many videos.
The main culprits of deadening sugar include: white sugar and flour, sweetened and processed foods, and fast food. When these foods break down in the body (when compared to natural sources of fructose from fruit), they cause an increase of hormones to be released (specifically insulin), and in effect, signal forcancer cells to feed and continue to grow in size.
Dr. Lewis Cantley, head of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) at Harvard University, shared the sugar-cancer link in a CBS interview:“What we’re beginning to learn is that insulin can cause adverse effects in various tissues, and a particular concern is cancer.”
He continued,“If you happen to have a tumor that has insulin receptors on it, then it will get stimulated to take up the glucose that’s in the bloodstream. So rather than going to the fat or to the muscle, the glucose now goes into the tumor, and the tumor uses it to grow.”
These sources came to the conclusion that the only way to have a healthy body, and a nourished mind, is to choose wholesome, unprocessed, and predominantly plant-based foods. You should consume more greens, vegetables and plant-based proteins, and decrease the amount of processed foods in your diet. Our bodies can be capable of healing themselves, and it is becoming increasingly evident that we must make the necessary changes for that to happen.",1

Not only is the inside of your windshield a difficult place to clean due to the angle, but it never seems to come out well despite the different cleaners and solutions you may try! Smudges, streaks and fingerprints are stuck on with most cleaning tactics, but not anymore! There’s an effective technique to get the dirt and grime off, and it’s easier than you might think!
For the best way to get off interior windshield marks, all you need to do is gather the following supplies: a microfiber towels (paper towels work if you can’t use microfiber), a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser (rubbing alcohol also works) and your standard glass cleaner. Once you have these items together and ready to go, it’s time to learn how to clean like a car was professional!
The first thing you need to do is “pre-wipe” the windshield with the microfiber cloth – do this in a circular motion to begin with and move to an up-and-down motion to get all of the grime off. Next you’ll move onto the second and third steps! The process isn’t difficult, but it does take a little elbow grease! Get all of the directions for a streak-free windshield by watching the helpful video below!

"Excuse my language but that is true. It is especially hard when you have to take notes of everything while in class. Your hands can get seriously cramped by holding than pen for eternity. Or the teacher might just be talking too fast for you to understand.
However, If you are in College you have the option to use an electronic device and make taking notes easier. I mean, you can’t be expected to pass an exam without knowing what’s on the test. You might not even understand the notes you steal from your friend, so people prefer writing their own.
But have you ever thought of a collaboration?
No? Well, neither have I. That’s probably why we think studying is so hard.Here’s a story about some students who figured out a way to beat the system.

"Two high school pupils have created an app designed to encourage children to enjoy the outdoors more often.
Mari-Ann Ganson and Ellora James, who are both 17, created Envirocache for an apps competition.
The Wick High School students' app draws on geo-cache technology to provide children with nature treasure hunts while they go for walks.
Ellora's work on the project has helped her to win 2017's Scottish Women in Technology One to Watch award.
She said: ""It's so humbling to be at the beginning of my journey and yet still recognised for my passion for technology.
""I hope that I can use this success to continue to be a role model for others, work to improve diversity in technology and show how schools can work to encourage this too.""
The teenagers received help from Interface, an organisation that provides support in developing products.
It matched the pair with an academic at Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University to develop their app.
Wick High School in Caithness has a reputation for encouraging its students to make innovative uses of technology.
Last year, pupils created an award-winning app designed to engage young people in politics.
The One Click Politics app won the information category at the national Apps for Good Awards.

"Longtime Heroin Addict Fights For Recovery : Shots - Health News   Andrea Towson was known in West Baltimore as the go-to person for help getting high. Last year, she nearly died from a fentanyl overdose. ""Thank God for another day,"" she says.
'That Fentanyl — That's Death': A Story Of Recovery In Baltimore
'That Fentanyl — That's Death': A Story Of Recovery In Baltimore
'That Fentanyl — That's Death': A Story Of Recovery In Baltimore
Andrea Towson used heroin for more than three decades. After a near-death experience with fentanyl, she sought help.
Two summers ago, we met a woman who went by the name Teacup.   ""I'm an active heroin user,"" she told us. ""Thirty-three years as a matter of fact.""   We were in West Baltimore, reporting on a citywide effort to stop a growing opioid crisis. On a street corner known for its open-air drug market, health workers trained anyone passing by on how to use naloxone, a medication that can reverse an opioid overdose. They were trying to get naloxone kits into as many hands as possible.   Teacup had stopped by the training to say hello to a veteran health worker and to pick up another kit. She was already well-versed in the use of naloxone, having administered it more than a dozen times, she estimated. She called herself a ""doctor"" but not because of her experience intervening in overdoses. It was because she was the go-to person in the neighborhood if you needed help getting high.
""I can hit veins that most people can't,"" she explained at the time. ""I'm not glorifying it, but they come to me because they know I ain't going to let you die. And you're going to be OK. If you do go out, I'm going to bring [you] back, and I'm going to call the ambulance afterward.""   Teacup's real name is Andrea Towson. We tried to keep in touch with her, but it wasn't easy. Her daily routine consisted of waking up, trying to make money for heroin, looking for heroin, buying heroin, shooting it and then starting that process all over again.   Finally, on a cold winter day in 2016, we sat down with her again on a park bench not far from where we had first met. Her face was drawn, and she seemed listless. She told us she was tired.   ""I want this chapter of my life to close. Just end. I'm just — I'm done. And it's not happening fast enough,"" she told us. ""I just want to wake up and eat breakfast and be normal, whatever that might be.""   What followed may sound familiar to people who struggle with addiction. Towson sought treatment, only to find herself on a waiting list. Other times, she missed appointments with rehabilitation programs.   For many months, we didn't know what happened to Teacup. But then this summer, we got word that she had eventually made it into treatment and had just celebrated eight months of recovery.
Towson carries two naloxone kits with her at all times and has used them to revive people who overdose. She now trains the public on how to use naloxone.
We caught up with her on a sweltering July day, just across from the recovery center known as Penn North, where she has been in programs since last fall.   As we sat down to talk, six police cars screamed by.   ""Lord, I hope nobody's child is dead,"" she said as she waited for the sirens to fade. ""It's just so crazy.""   That stretch of West Baltimore hadn't changed much since we were last there, but Andrea Towson had.   She was barely recognizable — in a good way — wearing a slim black dress, a straw hat and sunglasses.
The small yard outside of Penn North overflowed with people sitting on metal folding chairs, fanning themselves and chatting in the heat. All recovering addicts, Towson said.   Demand for addiction treatment is high in Baltimore, as it is in many cities and communities across the country. Towson believes the reason is the spread of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid far more powerful than heroin.   ""Nowadays, everybody's scared. That fentanyl — that's death,"" she said. ""I thank God I chose when I did — or He appointed me to be chosen — to change my mind when I did, because I know I wouldn't have made it. ... Thank God for another day.""   Towson had her own near-death experience with fentanyl more than a year and a half ago, during a blizzard that dropped more than 2 feet of snow on Baltimore. She was getting high with a group of people, she told us. She and another woman were given the task of testing a new batch of dope. She wouldn't know until later that it was laced with fentanyl. It would be her first and last taste of the drug.
Towson was known in her West Baltimore neighborhood as Teacup. For years, she was the go-to person for help getting high.
""When I opened my eyes, I was being lifted in the air,"" she recalled. ""All I kept saying was 'I'm so cold.' They had set us outside and left us — didn't call an ambulance or nothing.""   Towson was lucky. She said a police helicopter spotted her and called an ambulance. By the end of the night, she had been revived twice and hospitalized.   Still, she didn't stop getting high. It took more than six months — and seeing more and more people around her dying of overdoses — for her to finally commit to treatment.   ""This is my truth. When you ready, you ready, and when you not, you not,"" said Towson. ""And only you know that.""   Recovery has its share of challenges. Towson needs to find a long-term place to live. She needs steady work. And she has to stay off drugs while living in the same neighborhood where she spent so many years getting high.   Her plan is to stick to a routine. She attends a daily support meeting and is working with the nonprofit health advocacy organization Bmore Power, which holds naloxone trainings and other events for people at risk in Baltimore.   As for waking up, having breakfast and being ""normal""? That has been achieved.   ""Abso-damnit-lutely,"" she said with a broad smile. ""I eat bagels now, with cream cheese.""      All Things Considered intern Lee Mengistu contributed to this report.
A previous version of this story described a meeting with Andrea Towson  in January. That meeting occurred in early 2016.",0
"While there are many advantages to living in a digital world, the connected life also has its drawbacks.
One of the biggest disadvantages is that it gives fraudsters numerous opportunities to gain access to our personal identification. Last year alone, 15.4 million consumers were the victims of identity theft, a 17.5% increase from the previous year. With this information, thieves can open new accounts in our names, steal from our existing accounts, and use it as a veil of authenticity during the commission of scams.
Fraud and identity theft have become a fact of life in today’s world. This year, when the Global Fraud Index was released, one statistic stood out more than any other: Account takeover fraud skyrocketed by more than 45% year over year in 2017’s second quarter and cost merchants a whopping $3.3 billion in that three-month period. While exact figures are extremely difficult to come by, other studies confirm the overall trend. Javelin Strategy’s 2017 Identity Fraud Study, released in February, reported account takeover incidents increased by 31% in 2016 with consumer losses reaching $2.3 billion, a 61% increase from the previous year.
As an economic-crimes detective, I see the financial pain and emotional stress this type of crime causes firsthand. And while this type of fraud has always been rampant, my own experience confirms the research results: This type of fraud isn’t going away and only seems to be growing more common.
Account takeover fraud occurs when criminals gain access to victims’ bank or credit card accounts and then make unauthorized transactions on the account. While this encompasses credit card fraud, when someone uses your credit card number to make a purchase, more insidious versions of this crime go deeper. After all, consumers enjoy far-reaching protection against permanent monetary loss when they are victims of simple credit card fraud, but bad cases of account takeover fraud can involve far more.
I’ve seen cases where suspects gain access to a victim’s banking account and promptly change the account holder’s phone number, physical and email address, and online password. The legitimate account holders are effectively locked out of their own accounts, ensuring that they will no longer even receive texts or emails alerting them to the suspicious activity.

Consumer information can be stolen in a variety of ways; some of the most common methods of stealing data include malware, phishing, and data breaches. Indeed, it seems hardly a month goes by without another data breach at a major corporation where millions of consumers’ payment information was stored. Earlier this fall, the data breach at Equifax was nearly unprecedented in scope and breadth, affecting 143 million Americans.
Phishing and malware attacks are also on the rise. Symantec estimates that 54.3% of all email is spam and that there are nearly 1.6 million blocked Web attacks each day. In June, the company stated that phishing attacks increased to about one out of every 1,975 emails. With massive, high-profile data breaches making the news and phishing and malware attacks rising, the increase in account takeovers doesn’t seem poised to slow down anytime soon.
What you can do to protect yourself
There is no silver bullet to stop fraud. With these types of attacks on the rise, it’s almost inevitably just a matter of time before we’re all victimized. We can, however, take definitive steps that will decrease our exposure to being targeted and mitigate the severity of the incidents when they take place.
1. Develop strong and unique passwords across all of your accounts. When most of us hear of a data breach that might directly affect us, we immediately fear the theft of our personal identification, including our name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number. What many of us fail to consider is whether we’ve used a password for that account that we used elsewhere.
Unless one is unusually savvy with memorizing odd word combinations or develops a highly sophisticated system, using unique, strong passwords (using letters, numbers, and symbols) across every single site where an account is kept is almost impossible. That’s why I strongly suggest using software or websites that are designed to do this very thing. Doing so saves people the headache of performing this Herculean task on their own. Although most of these cost money, some will run their program across one device for free. A few things to look for when researching these services include two-factor authentication, automatic password capture, form-filling capabilities with multiple form-filling identities, and secure sharing.
2. Always pay with a credit card. Frank Abagnale Jr., the former conman turned security consultant made famous by the movie Catch Me If You Can, tells clients he removes 99.9% of all fraud risk by using credit cards. Why? Because consumers are limited to $50 of liability when credit card fraud is reported in a timely manner. That’s far more legal protection than any other payment method offers. Likewise, consumers are in a position of strength because they’re never without the money in their banking accounts; they’re merely arguing over how much money they owe their credit card company.
3. Avoid writing personal checks whenever possible. Think about the most damaging information that could be leaked to potential thieves and fraudsters and then consider what’s printed on the front of your personal checks: your name, address, banking institution, routing number, and bank account number. That’s a treasure trove of information for anyone wishing to defraud you. For this reason, if at all possible, only write checks to trusted friends or family members. Otherwise, run to the ATM for a quick cash withdrawal if you can’t pay with a credit card, or use a digital payment service such as PayPal or Venmo.
4. Monitor your accounts closely. Finally, make sure you keep tabs on all of your accounts — checking, savings, brokerage, credit card — and immediately report any suspicious activity. Regularly make sure your account contact information is up to date and correct. Even watch out for small charges that almost seem inconsequential at first. Many times, fraudsters will use the account for small transactions first to ensure the information they have is working.
Account-takeover fraud can be draining affairs — both financially and emotionally. But people who take these steps stand to be affected much less if they’re victimized.

"My family is a seasonal cliche. This spring, we went on a spring-cleaning frenzy and scrubbed out our garage, closets and pantry, giving away outgrown items and using up every can of beans and box of pasta we could. During the summer, we moved on to eating corn, tomatoes and watermelon almost every night, often staying up to watch the later sunset. And now that it is fall, we are gathered around college football games eating bowl after bowl of chili with scoop after scoop of guacamole on top.
There are scientific reasons for these seasonal platitudes, and it is no surprise that during each season nature provides us with the foods our bodies need for optimal health.
In the spring, people generally want to feel lighter after the heaviness of winter weather, sweaters and so much time indoors, so getting rid of unwanted items and reducing clutter is a no-brainer. The spring harvest brings us bitter greens such as arugula to detoxify our liver from the fats and heavier foods we ate all winter, also making us feel lighter.
[ Quinoa, meet convenience: New products make whole grains less of a hassle ]
In the summer, we are generally more active, spend more time outdoors, and enjoy an extra hour or two of daylight, so our bodies require the added energy we get from the natural carbohydrates and sugars found in summer fruits and vegetables such as corn, peas, peaches, cantaloupe and strawberries. We also need more water when the temperatures rise, so liquid-rich foods such as watermelon and cucumbers sustain us.
As we begin to feel the crisp, cool air of fall and winter, our bodies start to crave fewer raw salads and more cooked, warming foods such as soups, stews, meats and avocados. The fall harvest begins with an abundance of apples, which are high in fiber and pectin to help cleanse the intestines and support digestion, specifically the digestion of fat.
This makes sense, as a winter diet contains foods higher in fats and protein such as meats and nuts. The cold winter air and wind dries out the earth, and our bodies can become dry, too, a sensation we feel in our throats and sinuses. To counteract the drying effects of winter, we draw on nature’s high-protein, high-fat diet in the form of warm, heavy, oily foods that replenish our depleted moisture reserves. Bananas, avocados, beets, winter squash, nuts, meat, deep-sea fish and olive oil all help keep our bodies warm, moist and nourished. If we continue to eat only foods that are cooling to our bodies such as cucumbers, strawberries and melons, our sinuses can become unhealthily dry and more susceptible to colds and flus.
Ten ways to prepare and eat for the fall season:
1. If you didn’t jump on the spring-cleaning bandwagon, dig through your pantry and refrigerator and discard expired items. Make a list of pantry essentials, then take inventory to see what you have and what you need. If you are using an online meal-planning service, input your pantry inventory so you can keep track of it and regularly replenish it through automatic grocery lists.
2. You will probably use your oven a lot more often than you did in the summer, so clean it.
3. Gather recipes that are more appropriate for fall such as soups, stews, chilies, curries, root vegetables and heavier meats.
4. Shop at farmers markets to get a sense of what is in season. Based on these seasonal foods, begin tapering your intake of raw vegetables and broadening the variety of root vegetables you cook, such as beets, parsnips, carrots, butternut squash and sweet potatoes. Choose sweet, sour and heavy fruits such as oranges, bananas, avocados, grapefruit, pineapples and mangoes over berries and stone fruit. All of these vegetables and fruits are rich in vitamins A and C to boost immune health before the cold and flu season begins.
5. Use a variety of healthy fats such as coconut oil, olive oil, flaxseed oil, walnut oil and ghee. Snack on nuts and seeds.
6. Eat whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, millet and barley. They are full of dietary fiber for healthy digestion, iron for blood health, B vitamins for energy and the antioxidant vitamin E for cellular health.
7. Make a homemade, nutritious stock to use in soups, stews and sauces.
8. Add warming spices to your dishes such as ginger, cinnamon, cumin, cardamom, mustard seed, clove and fennel.
9. Add wintergreens such as Swiss chard, collards, kale and spinach to soups, smoothies and pasta dishes.
10. Hearten your smoothies by adding almond butter, raw cacao and hearty greens such as kale.",0
"(N. Morgan)The medicinal properties and health benefits of apple cider vinegar have become undeniable. For one thing, this common kitchen ingredient has strong antiseptic properties, which makes it an excellent tool against germs and bacteria.
It isalso a powerful detoxifier that efficiently eliminateswaste and toxins from your body. The raw unfiltered version of ACV is the most beneficial of all.
There is one drawback to this natural medicine and it’s the high acidic content of ACV, which can damage your tooth enamel if taken inadequately or improperly.
In this articleyou can find some unusual, but highly beneficial uses of ACV. Read on and learn how ACV can improve the quality of your life even in areas you weren’t aware of.
ACV makes an efficient natural remedy against hair loss. Losing 100 strands of hair a day is considered normal, anything above this is alarming. It’s usually the androgen hormones that trigger thinning hair or excessive hair loss. However, apple cider vinegar can restore the pH balance of the scalp stimulating healthy hair growth. It’s also beneficial for treating dandruff and itchy scalp. Last, but not least, it eliminates dead skin cells which normally clog the hair follicles and thus inhibit hair growth.
Asthma is a serious lung condition that prevents proper breathing. Although there are a number of medications for treatment of this condition, you can also resort to natural remedies. One such remedy that effectively alleviates asthma symptoms is apple cider vinegar used as an inhaler.
Frequent nose bleeds that appear for no particular reason affect a large number of people. To treat this health issue, drink a mixture of 2 tsps. ACV and a glass of water three times a day. ACV is extremely beneficial for stimulating the natural blood clotting process.
Cold winter weather is normally accompanied by irritating and painful coughs. If you want to reduce cough symptoms without medications, use apple cider vinegar, preferably raw and unfiltered.
Apple cider vinegar is highly beneficial for fighting bacteria that cause diarrhea. In addition, its high pectin content sooths the irritation of the colon lining. Simply, mix 2 tbsps. ACV and 8 oz water and drink 3 times a day.
Mixing 1 tbsp ACV and 8 ounces water and drinking this before going to bed can help against sleeplessness. You’ll not only fall asleep faster, but also wake up refreshed in the morning.
Apples, which are low in sugar but high in acidity, account for the high acidic content in ACV. In fact, fermented apples are the main ingredient of apple cider vinegar. According to natural medicine, ACV can effectively relieve dizziness and vertigo by reducing blood pressure and blood glucose levels.
Apple cider vinegar is extremely beneficial against ear infections as well. Simply mix equal amounts of water and apple cider vinegar. Then soak a cotton ball in the solution and place it in your ear like an earplug. Let it act for five minutes, remove the ball and lie down on the side of the infected ear so that the liquid drains out. You can even use a hair dryer to dry your ears afterwards. If the infection appears in the Eustachian tubes, you can also gargle using apple cider vinegar.
You can treat eczema by consuming a mixture of ACV, honey and water three times a day. Also, you can apply diluted ACV on the affected skin twice a day.
You can relieve tired and sore eyes by drinking a mixture of ACV and honey (two teaspoons of each) and a glass of water three times a day.
ACV is particularly beneficial for relieving migraines, detoxification, balancing blood sugar levels, regulating blood pressure, alleviating joint pain, promoting weight loss and helping with constipation.
To relieve arthritic pain, mix a glass of water, two teaspoons ACV and two teaspoons of honey. Drink this three times a day. Or, soak the painful area in ACV solution, but no longer than 10 minutes. Repeat the treatment 2-3 times a day. Alternatively, soak a cloth in ACV solution and apply it on the painful spot. Repeat several times a day.
To effectively fight fatigue, make a mixture of 3 tsps. ACV and a cup of honey. Take this before going to bed. The honey will start acting in 20 minutes – your muscles will become more relaxed and your fatigue will slowly disappear.
ACV is particularly beneficial for soothing GI lining and destroying the bacteria that cause food poisoning. Simply mix 2 tbsps. ACV and a cup of hot water. Take this before a meal.
To alleviate allergy symptoms, including hay fever, dilute 1-3 tablespoons ACV in water and consume it during the day.
ACV is rich in magnesium, potassium, zinc and manganese, all of which can treat hearing problems. In fact, deficiencies in these minerals often result in temporary or permanent hearing loss. It also helps prevent the development of sclerosis. Mix 1 tsp apple cider vinegar and 1 tsp honey in a cup of water. Drink 3 cups 3 times a day.
ACV stimulates digestion and prevents common digestive discomforts such as heartburn or reflux. Just mix a teaspoon of ACV in a cup of water and drink before meals.
The ACV supports blood clotting. If you’ve got a cut, take 2 tsps ACV mixed with half a glass of water. Drink a maximum of 6 glasses of this mixture during the day.
To prevent hiccups, consume 1 tsp ACV or ACV mixed with water before a meal.
Before doing this treatment, try it first on a small skin area. If you have sensitive skin, you might get a rash. Lie down on a flat surface, put a few pillows under your ankles for reducing the blood flow and apply the ACV compress.
To reduce hypertension, mix 2 tsps ACV with honey in a glass of water. Drink this 3-4 times a day. Be aware that this is only a temporary solution as high blood pressure largely depends on your diet and lifestyle.
You can fight infection-causing bacteria and support your immune system function by consuming diluted ACV. Simply mix 1-2 tbsps ACV in 8 ounces water and consume it during the day.
Take a mixture of 2 tsps ACV and a glass of water 3 times a day to normalize menstrual bleeding.
To reduce mucous discharge, cut out rye, corn and wheat from your diet and use ACV as an alternative remedy.
ACV is extremely beneficial for restoring the pH balance in the throat and relieving throat pain. Plus, it breaks down the phlegm, making it thinner and easier to expel. ACV contains prebiotic inulin, which supports the immune system and boosts white blood cells and T cell count.
ACV not only balances the skin pH levels, but also increases the skin’s acidic level, thus killing fungus, germs, bacteria and other micro organisms causing nail fungus. It also alleviates pain and itching.
To relieve anxiety bouts, mix 2 tsps ACV and 2 tsps honey and consume this 3 times a day.
To stop nose bleeds, use some ACV to coat the inside of your nostrils. You can do this by soaking a cotton ball in some organic apple cider vinegar. Place the cotton ball inside the nostril and leave it for 5 minutes. It will stop the bleeding and repair the blood vessel.
To alleviate itchy scalp, make a solution of 1 tsp ACV and a glass of water. Apply this on your scalp massaging gently. Do this 15 minutes before washing your hair. This will also help you get rid of dandruff.
To unblock your nose, use the same treatment as with headaches or use ACV as an inhalant.
To prevent overeating and promote digestion, drink a mixture of 2 tsps ACV and a glass of water in the morning on an empty stomach.
Mix 2 tbsps ACV and water or fresh juice and consume daily.
Whiten your teeth by mixing 1 tsp ACV and a glass of water. Use it as mouthwash before going to bed. Drink ACV to treat tooth decay, sore gums or ulcerated gums.
Important: The one important drawback from using ACV is that it can damage your tooth enamel or mucus membranes when taken undiluted. If taking medications for blood thinners, it’s important to consult your doctor before taking ACV, because it can reduce your potassium levels.

A six-justice majority of the high court ruled Thursday that a naturalized immigrant can lose his or her citizenship for lying to the government only if the lie would have led officials to deny citizenship or obscured facts likely to lead to such a denial. | Getty
The Supreme Court has complicated the Trump administration's efforts to strip naturalized Americans of citizenship due to false statements made during the naturalization process. A six-justice majority of the high court ruled Thursday that a naturalized immigrant can lose his or her citizenship for lying to the government only if the lie would have led officials to deny citizenship or obscured facts likely to lead to such a denial.""The Government must establish that an illegal act by the defendant played some role in her acquisition of citizenship,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for her fellow justices appointed by Democratic presidents, along with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""When the illegal act is a false statement, that means demonstrating that the defendant lied about facts that would have mattered to an immigration official.""Echoing concerns raised by Roberts and Kennedy at arguments in the case in April, Kagan said allowing the government to revoke citizenship due to any lie, no matter how minor or irrelevant, would lead to absurd outcomes.""Suppose, for reasons of embarrassment or what-have-you, a person concealed her membership in an online support group or failed to disclose a prior speeding violation,"" Kagan wrote. Allowing a revocation on that ""meager"" ground ""would give prosecutors nearly limitless leverage — and afford newly naturalized Americans precious little security,"" she added.At the oral arguments, Roberts scoffed at the Trump administration's position. When a Justice Department lawyer said someone could lose citizenship by failing to disclose that he or she went over the speed limit, the chief justice shot back: ""Oh, come on.""The case was brought to the high court by Divna Maslenjak, an Ohio resident who was stripped of citizenship on the ground that she lied by obscuring her husband's service in the Bosnian Serb Army. She and her husband were deported last year.

The case prompted Justice Neil Gorsuch to author his second opinion since joining the court in April: a concurrence that amounted to a dissent and argued the court's majority went too far in its ruling. Joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch said the lower courts erred in saying there didn't need to be any evidence that the lie might have affected a person's naturalization, but the threshold should be addressed in the first instance by the lower courts.""I believe it is work enough for the day to recognize that the statute requires some proof of causation, that the jury instructions here did not, and to allow the parties and the courts of appeals to take it from there are they usually do. This Court often speaks most wisely when it speaks last,"" Gorsuch wrote.Justice Samuel Alito would have applied a lower standard, saying that if the statement was ""material"" — meaning it had ""a natural tendency to influence the outcome — that's enough to strip citizenship. Alito also said the law ""does not require that an illegal false statement have a demonstrable effect on the naturalization decision.""The Trump administration has appeared eager to use the law to take citizenship from convicted terrorists and perhaps others. In March, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit aimed at stripping the U.S. citizenship of Iyman Faris, a Pakistani-born truck driver convicted in 2003 of plotting to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge.Faris is currently serving a 20-year sentence at a high security prison in Illinois. He's set for release in 2020.",0
"The World Health Organization, worried about an increasing epidemic of drug-resistant infections, has thrown its considerable weight behind the campaign to cut the use of antibiotics in pigs, chickens and cattle that are raised for their meat. The WHO is calling on governments to follow the example of Denmark and the Netherlands, which have banned the use of these drugs to make animals grow faster, or simply to protect healthy animals from getting sick.
The ""over-use and misuse of antimicrobials"" has occurred both in human medicine and on farms, says Marc Sprenger, a scientist at WHO. But in sheer quantity, the amount of antibiotics used on farms far exceeds what's used to treat people in many countries, including in the U. S.
""It's very important that we reduce use in human medicine and in animal production,"" says Kazuaki Miyagishima, director of the Department of Food Safety at the WHO.
The WHO has now issued its first formal guidelines for how these drugs should be used on farms. According to these guidelines, antibiotics cannot be used to promote faster growth or merely to prevent disease in healthy animals. The WHO called on veterinarians to avoid the use of antibiotics that are most critical in human health. The agency also wants governments to ban the use in animals of any new antibiotics that scientists may discover in the future.
These guidelines are stricter than current policies in the U. S. The Food and Drug Administration has worked with drug manufacturers to ban the use of antibiotics to promote faster growth, but it still allows veterinarians to prescribe these drugs for the purpose of disease prevention.
The greatest impact of the new guidelines, however, may be felt in countries like China, home to more than half of the world's pigs, where antibiotics have been used even more heavily than in the U. S.
""It's fair to say that they use more than the U. S., but I don't know how much more,"" says Jishu Shi, director of the U.S.-China Center for Animal Health at Kansas State University.
Shi says policies in China are changing, however. The Chinese government is starting to require that some antibiotics only be used in animals if prescribed by a veterinarian. In addition, some Western food companies are pushing their Chinese suppliers to reduce or even eliminate antibiotic use. McDonald's, for example, has promised to buy only chickens from suppliers that have stopped using drugs that are most important in human medicine. This policy will go into effect starting next year for suppliers in the U. S. and Europe, but only in 2027 for suppliers in China.
The effects of overusing antibiotics don't stop at national borders, because drug-resistant bacteria can spread around the globe, compromising the ability of drugs to fight infections. ""Antimicrobials are a global public good, and we all should be working together to preserve them,"" says Awa Aidara-Kane, coordinator for the Department of Food Safety at the WHO.
Public health advocates in the U. S. praised the WHO's new guidelines. David Wallinga, with the Natural Resources Defense Council, wrote in a blog post: ""let's hope the strong new WHO Guideline spurs more companies and more countries to take the actions that need to happen. Before it's too late.""
The National Pork Producers Council, on the other hand, condemned the WHO's proposals to ban the use of drugs for disease prevention, and to stop using drugs that are most critical for human health. According to the NPPC, such a ban ""is antithetical to pork farmers' and veterinarians' moral obligation to care for their pigs.""",0
"Capt. Russ Wittenberg is a unique individual in that he actually flew two of the planes that were “hijacked” on 911.
Flight “lets roll” 93 and flight 175, the plane that hit the south tower.
This is what he has to say about 911:
Former U. S. Air Force fighter pilot with over 100 combat missions. Retired commercial pilot. Flew for Pan Am and United Airlines for 35 years. Aircraft flown: Boeing 707, 720, 727, 737, 747, 757, 767, and 777. 30,000+ total hours flown.
Had previously flown the actual two United Airlines aircraft that were hijacked on 9/11 (Flight 93, which impacted in Pennsylvania, and Flight 175, the second plane to hit the WTC).
Video interview 9/11 Ripple Effect 8/07: “I flew the two actual aircraft which were involved in 9/11; the Fight number 175 and Flight 93, the 757 that allegedly went down in Shanksville and Flight 175 is the aircraft that’s alleged to have hit the South Tower.
I don’t believe it’s possible for, like I said, for a terrorist, a so-called terrorist to train on a [Cessna] 172, then jump in a cockpit of a 757-767 class cockpit, and vertical navigate the aircraft, lateral navigate the aircraft, and fly the airplane at speeds exceeding it’s design limit speed by well over 100 knots, make high-speed high-banked turns, exceeding — pulling probably 5, 6, 7 G’s.
And the aircraft would literally fall out of the sky. I couldn’t do it and I’m absolutely positive they couldn’t do it.” Article 7/17/05: “The government story they handed us about 9/11 is total B. S. plain and simple.” … Wittenberg convincingly argued there was absolutely no possibility that Flight 77 could have “descended 7,000 feet in two minutes, all the while performing a steep 280 degree banked turn before crashing into the Pentagon’s first floor wall without touching the lawn.”…
“I flew the two actual aircraft which were involved in 9/11; the Fight number 175 and Flight 93, the 757 that allegedly went down in Shanksville and Flight 175 is the aircraft that’s alleged to have hit the South Tower. I don’t believe it’s possible for, like I said, for a terrorist, a so-called terrorist to train on a [Cessna] 172, then jump in a cockpit of a 757-767 class cockpit, and vertical navigate the aircraft, lateral navigate the aircraft, and fly the airplane at speeds exceeding it’s design limit speed by well over 100 knots, make high-speed high-banked turns, exceeding — pulling probably 5, 6, 7 G’s. And the aircraft would literally fall out of the sky. I couldn’t do it and I’m absolutely positive they couldn’t do it.”
“For a guy to just jump into the cockpit and fly like an ace is impossible – there is not one chance in a thousand,” said Wittenberg, recalling that when he made the jump from Boeing 727’s to the highly sophisticated computerized characteristics of the 737’s through 767’s it took him considerable time to feel comfortable flying.”
“The airplane could not have flown at those speeds which they said it did without going into what they call a high speed stall.
The airplane won’t go that fast if you start pulling those high G maneuvers at those bank angles. … To expect this alleged airplane to run these maneuvers with a total amateur at the controls is simply ludicrous… It’s roughly a 100 ton airplane.
And an airplane that weighs 100 tons all assembled is still going to have 100 tons of disassembled trash and parts after it hits a building.
There was no wreckage from a 757 at the Pentagon. … The vehicle that hit the Pentagon was not Flight 77.
We think, as you may have heard before, it was a cruise missile.”",1
"As much a political weapon as miracle treatment for myriad physical and mental ailments, cannabis has endured decades of embarrassingly inaccurate propaganda meant to instill an air of criminality and shame with its use — in particular, claims spewed by drug warrior politicians and the corporate press, that regular pot smokers are damaging their IQs.
Unsurprisingly — at least to the untold thousands of people benefiting medically, psychologically, and, yes, recreationally, as well as to the researchers of a voluminous, cumulative body of evidence proving cannabis’ sweeping potential — they were wrong.
Examining the relationship between IQ and cannabis use, researchers from the United States and United Kingdom “found that youth who used cannabis … had lower IQ at age 18, but there was little evidence that cannabis use was associated with IQ decline from age 12 to 18. Moreover, although cannabis use was associated with lower IQ and poorer executive functions at age 18, these associations were generally not apparent within pairs of twins from the same family, suggesting that family background factors explain why adolescents who use cannabis perform worse on IQ and executive function tests.”
And, in fact, “Short-term cannabis use in adolescence does not appear to cause IQ decline or impair executive functions, even when cannabis use reaches the level of dependence.”
Adolescent cognitive performance suffered negative impacts from various “family background factors” — not, as the anti-cannabis crowd long assumed, from weed — adding to a growing body of evidence pot doesn’t actually wreak havoc the Drug Enforcement Administration, Jeff Sessions, and other drug warriors keep vomiting, wholly ignorant of fact.
“In the largest longitudinal examination of marijuana use and IQ change,” researchers from the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Minnesota concluded in a cognate 2016 study, “we find little evidence to suggest that adolescent marijuana use has a direct effect on intellectual decline. …[T]he lack of a dose–response relationship, and an absence of meaningful differences between discordant siblings lead us to conclude that the deficits observed in marijuana users are attributable to confounding factors that influence both substance initiation and IQ rather than a neurotoxic effect of marijuana.”
Another study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology the same year mimicked those results, AlterNet notes. Assessing the intelligence quotient and academic fitness of 2,235 adolescent twins, investigators found — after accounting for external factors like tobacco and alcohol — teen cannabis enthusiasts “did not differ from never-users on either IQ or educational performance.”
Then, this month, conclusions by University of Florida researchers in still another study — a 14-year analysis of cannabis exposure and intelligence — affirmed results of the others. Writing in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence on August 1, investigators asserted, “our findings did not reveal a significant association between cumulative marijuana use and changes in intelligence scores.”
Much of the vocal anti-cannabis cadre cite impossibly flawed research from New Zealand, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2012, which found — thanks to their failure to account for extenuating factors such as the consumption of additional substances — a minimal reduction of six to eight points in IQ among those smoking cannabis beginning in early adolescence, and continuing through age 38.
Two subsequent related studies verily dispute the oft-cited lower-IQ analysis, contending the original authors’ skewed research too significantly — through the omission of both subject socioeconomic data and on individual use of tobacco and so on — to merit peer confirmation of the results.
It would be entirely possible, in other words, for the drop in IQ over the tested time period to have resulted from factors other than the cannabis studied — and that persistent adolescent consumption of the herb on academic performance should imperatively be considered “non-significant after controlling for persistent alcohol and tobacco use.”
Politicians, desperate to continue manning the helm as the titanic travesty known as the Drug War tanks ever quicker beneath the surface under the monumental burdens of overcriminalization, excessive-incarceration, and asinine propaganda so insulting to the public in an age where information sits split seconds away.
Thankfully, Americans have had enough of politicized, harmful laws, like cannabis prohibition, and — thanks in large part to disinfo-busting studies like those cited here — refuse to have their intelligence insulted by the stalest of all the mothball-laden anti-pot propaganda.

"The knees play an extremely important role as they are in charge of the mobility, flexibility, and balance of the body, and they help us to jump, run, walk, and stand.
Yet, they can experience damage and lead to pain due to various reasons.
For instance, a strenuous exercise may lead to an over exertion on the joint of the knee or genetics as there may be a reduced amount of the fluid which lubricates the knee joints and prevents the bone from gnashing with bone. In this case, the thigh bone and the knee bone may touch and cause pain.
The pain may also be caused by bad footwear, as for example, high heels apply great pressure on the leg joints from the knees. In this way, the ankle and the Achilles ligaments are exposed to great strain.
Moreover, excess body weight also causes issues, as the knees should carry it.
However, there is a natural remedy that will help you strengthen the ligaments and knee joints in a completely safe and delicious way. Its ingredients are high in anti-inflammatory properties which relieve the pain and swelling of the knee joint.
They are also high in silicon, bromelain, vitamin C, and magnesium, and thus provide vitality and strength to the bones. They include oranges, cinnamon, oatmeal, almonds, pineapple, and raw, natural honey.
This is how to prepare this delicious 6- ingredient smoothie:

"Apple has revealed a high-end smartphone with an ""edge-to-edge"" screen that has no physical home button.
The iPhone X - which is referred to as ""ten"" - uses a facial recognition system to recognise its owner rather than a fingerprint-based one.
Apple said FaceID can work in the dark by using 30,000 infra-red dots to check an identity, and was harder to fool than its old TouchID system.
It is Apple's most expensive phone yet.
A 64 gigabyte capacity model will cost $999 (999 in the UK) when it goes on sale on 3 November. A 256GB version will be priced at $1,149 (1,149 in the UK).
By contrast, Samsung is charging $930 (869 in the UK) for its new Note 8 phone, which has 64GB of storage.
""The iPhone X is a long-term investment by Apple that sets a template for the next generation of iPhone hardware,"" commented Geoff Blaber from the CCS Insight consultancy.
""An OLED [organic light-emitting diode] display and the new design is likely to be standard on future iPhone models, but Apple must first tackle the challenge of obtaining sufficient supplies.""
Apple said the switch to an OLED display would help the phone produce ""true blacks"" and more accurate colours than before. LG and Samsung already use similar tech on their handsets.
Prior to the launch, Apple's most expensive phone was an iPhone 7 Plus that cost $969 (919 in the UK).
One expert commented that Apple's ability to get consumers to spend more on its smartphones than rivals' was ""legendary"".
""There may be an element of high pricing to constrain demand and make things match up with how many they can produce,"" said Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics.
""But I suspect Apple always had a $1,000 iPhone in mind - we had seen the price creep up year after year, and there's a lot of pressure from shareholders for the company to hit a $1tn valuation.
""Bumping up the prices on their number one product is one way of doing that.""
Apple acknowledged that users might have concerns about using facial recognition to verify purchases via Apple Pay or to access their device.
But it claimed that while there was a one-in-50,000 chance that TouchID could be unlocked by a random stranger, the odds rose to one-in-one-million with FaceID.
Nevertheless, one expert said users might still be concerned the handset had no fingerprint sensor as an alternative.
""This is the steepest hurdle that they have,"" commented Carolina Milanesi from market research firm Creative Strategies.
""A lot of consumers will be a little bit reluctant to use facial recognition as an ID system until Apple has proven that it is safe and works all the time.
""In the eyes of consumers TouchID wasn't broken - so they may ask why Apple is trying to fix it.""
Other features announced about the handset included:
* its 5.8in (14.7cm) screen has 458 pixels per inch, making it the firm's most detailed phone display to date. To mark this it has been branded ""super retina""
* the lack of a home button is dealt with by requiring users to swipe up to access its apps, and to press a side button to summon its virtual assistant Siri
* portrait mode - in which the camera blurs a photo's background - and a relighting tool can be used on pictures taken by both the front and rear cameras
* it has two hours more battery life than the iPhone 7
It's the big(ger) leap that iPhone fans - and Wall Street - had been demanding.
The iPhone X brings together many features we'd been expecting - such as FaceID for unlocking the phone, and animated emojis - animojis - that look fun to play with, if not a killer feature that will have people running to stores.
All this won't come cheap: at $999+ it's the most expensive iPhone to date.
Apple is often accused of being slow to new tech, and I think that criticism will continue.
Wireless charging comes years after Samsung first introduced it, for example, and the overall look of the phone - which no longer has the iconic home button - looks strikingly similar to the latest Samsung Galaxy Note.
The phone was unveiled in the new Steve Jobs Theater, a purpose-built venue for such launches.
A beautiful, comfy building, with marble everywhere, it sits alongside Apple's striking new spaceship campus. This is the house that iPhone built, with a decade of phenomenal success.
Does iPhone X herald another great era? The audience here cheered, but didn't stand, with applause. I'm reserving my judgement until I've tried it.
The iPhone X also adds support for wireless charging.
""It was the right decision to use a standard because Apple users will benefit from widely available charge pads.""
The feature was also introduced to the new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models, which were introduced earlier at the event.
The lower-end 4.7in and 5.5in devices are distinguished from their predecessors by having:
* improved camera sensors that help them operate in low light
* stereo speakers that are 25% louder than before
The iPhone 8 ranges from $699 to $849 and the iPhone 8 Plus from $799 to $949.
They will cost the same amounts in Sterling and go on sale on 22 September.
The new models coincide with the release of iOS 11 - the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system.
It introduces ARKit - software development tools that make it easier for developers to add augmented reality features to their apps, in which graphics are mixed together with real-world views.
Marketing chief Phil Schiller showed off one app that - if used by spectators at a sports stadium - would show real-time stats hovering over the live action.
Another demo involved the Machines, a multiplayer robot-battle game that can be played over views of close-by table tops and other surfaces.
The facility will not work on the iPhone 6 or older devices, so may provide a means to convince owners of ageing Apple kit to upgrade.
""When Apple first introduced the iPhone users were unsure about how touchscreens would benefit them, but now we know that they're a great way to use a device,"" said Brian Blau, a tech industry analyst at Gartner.
""The same thing will happen with augmented reality - it's as important as touch, if not more.
""Developers have new opportunities and I think they will embrace them, but just as with touch it took them years to perfect those experiences, I also think that will also happen with AR.""
Apple also unveiled a version of its smartwatch with its own 4G link.
The innovation means that the Watch Series 3 can receive phone calls, access internet services and stream music without being linked to an iPhone. Users will, however, face an additional monthly charge for the benefit.
Apple recently overtook Fitbit to become the world's joint-top wearable tech-maker alongside Xiaomi, according to one study.
Other companies - including LG and Samsung - have previously sold smartwatches with in-built cellular capabilities, but battery-life restrictions and other issues limited interest.
""Apple's ability in the past to generate new markets when others thought they were dead is legendary,"" commented Mr Mawston.
""For people like joggers, runners and cyclists who possibly want to do hardcore sports outdoors without carrying two devices, an LTE Apple Watch could be something of a blessing.""
The latest version of the Watch's operating system - which will also be available to earlier models - will include new heart monitor functions.
It will warn owners if their heart rate becomes elevated when they are not active or if its rhythm becomes irregular, to flag the possibility of disease.
The 4G Apple Watch will cost $399 (300) and be released on 22 September.
Apple also announced a fresh version of its TV set-top box, which now supports 4K video and high dynamic range (HDR) content.
In one of the few details not to have leaked in advance, Apple revealed it had struck a deal with several of the major movie studios to ensure that films in the higher-resolution, richer-colour formats would not cost more than their high-definition (HD) equivalents.
Users' existing iTunes movie libraries will also be upgraded without charge.
HDR 4K movies have already been available to rent or buy from services including Amazon, but they tended to be sold at much higher prices than lower-quality formats.",0

We all have used an ATM or gas pump, in fact, many of us use these devices on a daily basis. The next time you get ready to use your card, make sure to keep your eye out for this new scam.
According to PC Mag, Folks are implanting skimmers on ATMs all across the country. It does not matter if you are using the ATM at a gas station, outside a bank, or at a grocery store. Essentially, a skimmer is a device that goes over the slot where you insert your card. Once your card is inserted past the skimmer, the scam artist has full access to your debit card — and your money.
Skimmers come in a variety of styles. Most are designed to take the information from your card and hold it onto a chip inside the device. However, some scam artists are getting creative and found a way to get the skimmer to send the information remotely to their mobile device or laptop.
The results of being hit by a skimmer can be devastating. People have managed to lose their entire life savings due to these terrible devices and scammers who use them.
There are ways that you can protect yourself from falling victim to this scam. If you are using an ATM, always make sure you grab where the card slot is and gently pull on it. You do not have to worry about damaging the ATM.
If there is a skimmer, it will pull off right into your hand. If this happens to you, get somewhere safe, and call the police. The person who planted the skimmer could be nearby.
Besides skimmers, there is another way that scammers are getting your card information. Unbelievably, they are doing it at gas stations across the country. It involves placing a small camera at the pump.
Criminals are putting the camera up above the screen of the gas pump. It is worth noting that these cameras will be much smaller than your average security camera that you see at most gas stations.
When you do your initial check for cameras, don’t forget to give the card slot a gentle tug to make sure there is no skimmer in place, and pump your gas as usual. It is a shame that we are getting to this point, but the best thing you can do is be aware of what you are doing, and your surroundings.
These scammers prey on people who don’t pay attention to their surroundings. If you are aware and don’t check regularly, you can easily avoid becoming a victim of this sick crime. As technology advances, criminals are finding new and inventive ways to take advantage of people who don’t know any better. Arm yourself with knowledge and do not become a victim.
If more scammer tactics are found you better believe that they will be reported here to help keep you and your loved ones safe. Make sure you tell your friends about this, they NEED to know about this scam!

We all want to feel comfortable in our homes, but there are times when we can feel violated. I’m not talking about another person coming in, I’m talking about little critters, such as mice and spiders. If you have those unwelcome visitors, fixing it is as easy as using a bag of tea. The type of tea you would use is Peppermint.
The method for making this work is easier than you could possibly imagine. Simply brew a cup of peppermint tea and then leave the bag in the room where spiders and mice have been a problem. You even get to enjoy the cup of tea! Put the tea bag in a corner, so it is best if you use 4 tea bags, one in each corner.
If you aren’t one to brew some tea, you can get the same results with essential oil. Put 10 – 15 drops of peppermint oil in a spray bottle full of water and spray it around the baseboards. Not only does it help to keep spiders and mice away, your home is going to smell fantastic! For spiders, you can also use cinnamon and lemon oil.
Be sure to share this with your friends on Facebook.

"World famous photographer Miles Aldridge has taken photographs of Arya Stark, Cersei Lannister, Daenerts Targaryen and other characters of “Games Of Thrones” in his own way, and it looks as strange as it looks fabulous.
“When pondering about how to capture each individual I wanted to recognize influences of themes in the show while seizing the traits of their own unique character, said the photographer.
Aldridge’s unique over-saturated style is evocative of Hollywood sets from the 40s-60s: its full of light, drama and intense colors. “The bright color story in each picture brings the viewers into the world that has been created for these actors while the cautious location and selection of each prop brings to lfe the dark and mystical world of The Game Of Thrones.”
The whole thing was photo’d with a Rolleiflex 6001 camera and a 120/180mm lens, set at f.16, and making use of Kodak Ektar 100 film.",1

BTW, Bahmer, if my memory serves me properly (?) I will be re-posting a thread next week that was described to me as one of the very best ever read on OPP.  Look for it, as I am re-posting these few years later due to my recollection of said response/comment thru PM.
[quote=Steve700]I believe that request was for statements made by , not by various people on Facebook whom you have no way of knowing are actually even voting Republicans.   Beyond that, what you cited isn't near as asinine as those of top Democratic party officials, and in many cases even correct, such as that this country was founded as a Christian nation and on the Christian religion. Just because it isn't stated in the Constitution doesn't mean that it wasn't founded on Christian principles. (and you should have the sense to know that) It wasn't put in there because our government wasn't intended to be a theocracy and it  intend to maintain a freedom of religion.
“Same-sex marriage ruins the sanctity of marriage.” — Said by the person who’s been divorced twice and cheated on both spouses. -----  We are all flawed human beings and because the guy is a sinner, unable or even unwilling to attain a standard of perfection does not mean government should degrade the sanctity of marriage by using it to bring up the abnormality/perversion of homosexuality to the state of normalcy and wholesomeness of heterosexual marriage (whose purpose is to bring up the next generation with their head screwed on straight) by using it to sanctify Butt FU**ING.  Now, do you have enough common sense and decency to realize that, or not?  . Nobody is telling anybody what to do, but don't degrade the Sanctified Purpose of marriage that way.
Did you know that the founding fathers never intended for there to be a personal income tax on your earnings. (I believe that is written down somewhere, although I can't tell you where -- it was my knowledgeable brother who was the Montana Freeman type, and they know their stuff on historical government and law far more than the lawyers, lawmakers and politicians)  Income tax is blatantly illegal.  It was passed on a holidaywith most of the politicians absent, and .  That's why they cannot prosecute you for not paying income tax, but only for lying when you tried to avoid income tax through deceit.  You are prosecuted because you sign your form stating your numerical assertions are true and correct.
“I’m for small government.”— Said by the person who supports a Constitutional Amendment defining marriage and laws which infringe on a woman’s right to choose.  This one is really patently ridiculous.  You are talking about a far larger issue here.  Your problem is that you don't value human life.  The bigger issue is that you are snuffing out a human life that is already in progress, never giving it a chance to live outside the womb at all.  And I think that's a little more important than a woman's right to Fu*k her brains out with whomever she chooses without taking proper precautions just figuring if something happens she'll deal with it later.
I could go on but I very wasted enough time on you. As I have demonstrated with these example, there is something not being taken into consideration that overpowers the point of your putting them there, proving these examples are for the simpleminded. And most importantly again. as I mentioned[u], the examples requested were supposed to be statements from Elected Republican officials & YOU AIN'T GOT NONE ![/quote]
Steve, those particular comments were a general response to OldSailor's original thread post, and had nothing to do with anything you posted.  And, unless you can point out where I missed it, there was no ""request for statements made by elected Republican officials in government,"" by you or anyone else, as you suggest erroneously in this comment of yours.  If you followed the thread, you would have discovered that 'E' and I have discussed the statements made by those faceless conservatives as to their value and worth, in addition to the ignorance also shown by conservatives at times.
I will give you credit for your personal experience with simple-mindedness, as you tend to exhibit it continuously.  In that vein, please explain the coherency in the following by you...""As I have demonstrated with these example, there is something not being taken into consideration that overpowers the point of your putting them there, proving these examples are for the simpleminded."" That seems to be an incomplete thought, making you appear as a waste of time.

For your information, if it is something that you wrote, comments of adoration from your fellow ignorant misguided Libtard's means nothing.
I see you are not responding to my post exposing your most recent nonsense here.  You, like every other liberal cannot post anything that I can't dismantle, turn around on you and expose as superficial ignorant Marxist programmed nonsense.  I'm not trying to put you down here, but wake you up.  Everything you think, believe put out here is a product of your indoctrination of Marxist propaganda.  Instead of ignoring me why don't you try having the integrity to admit that I have a point and have given you something worthy of reconsideration.  After all, the left is only a faade that is not what it portends to be. They are not better, finer, more caring and noble, but all about the acquisition of power so that they can control you and engineer society as though we all need to be managed like a bunch of sheep.  Not only are your leaders stupid to the core as proven in the cartoons that is the subject of this article, but they are exceedingly deceptive, corrupt and self-deluded living in a fantasy of what could be. (Stupidity and Degeneracy they go together)   It is only the conservatives who at least have the prime value of Truth, Honesty & Integrity as our prime values and that, my friend, results in wisdom, which is sadly lacking among Democrats as is proven by the situation in any long-term Democrat only run city.

Your comments here only confirm what I already exposed:  A lack of coherency in your thoughts and/or written word.  BTW, I declared it an ""incomplete thought,"" not an incomplete sentence.  Though, in retrospect it is a rambling, vague and unstructured run-on sentence. So many of yours are.  Also, I was speaking of conservatives in my posts, not republicans.  You now claim asking for equally stupid statements from republicans.  You did seem to somewhat suggest or imply it in your unmistakably inept manner.  And, I did present more evidence of such in a subsequent post to 'E.'  Even that admittedly conservative gentleman conceded that conservatives can, indeed, also be guilty of such asinine comments.  But, then, 'E' has structure to his thoughts as well as his writing.
""Limited comprehension to comprehend ""   Coming from you, that's rich.  Try 'limited ability to comprehend,' or just 'limited comprehension' as they make sense.  You don't.  It is hard to determine if it is your junior high writing skills, or your lack of functional thought that impedes you most.  You can't seem to give evidence of a capacity to clarify matters in your own mind, much less in print.

I do frequently write out long run on sentences. My bad. But I guess that makes it hard for you to comprehend.

Stop with your truth avoidance syndrome and defiant opposition disorder.  Realize that the left means corruption and an agenda of the acquisition of power by any means necessary.  Realize that the left has all the lowlife malcontents, criminals and haters of their own country. Realize they are not the party of the more caring and noble, but the party of control and subjugation who rob people of their individuality and independence and robs the minorities of their incentive and confidence as they convince people they are oppressed victims in need of support by the government, all so that they can get their democratic vote.  Leave the party of dehumanizing Marxist philosophy and government dependence and come across to the only party who holds Truth, Honesty & integrity as their prime value.  ---  And obviously in view of the truth contained herein,  And comparatively, I am not the one in need of healing.  ----  And yes, I need & needed repentance and that's why I did and continue to do so as of several years ago

"A successful retail layout project should make the retail location look more attractive and welcoming, while also increasing efficiency and comfort for employees. If you are giving your retail space a facelift, consider the following tips to help you give your location a leg up on the competition.
Lighting can create a particular mood and spotlight products you want to accentuate. Consider using low ambient light with track lights to point customers to featured merchandise. To create a relaxed atmosphere while complementing products, build lights into shelves and custom cabinets.
Getting a perfect layout that is best for your retail store, it’s crucial to hire a contractor who meets deadlines. Additionally, look for commercial construction contractors that are licensed, bonded, and insured. Do not be afraid to ask a contractor to meet with you before you make a final hiring decision. If a contractor does not arrive at a preliminary meeting on time, you may have a real clue about what working with him will be like.
First impressions are important, especially for retail stores. Aim for a look that intrigues and welcomes customers. To make your customers feel safe, create a layout that allows a visual scan of the entire store upon entrance. Further enhance the client experience with shelving units that are not too tall, aisle spaces that are comfortably wide and merchandise that is beautifully arranged logically.
Different colors trigger different emotions. For example, the color orange makes most people feel cheerful. Paint your retail space in a color that will help you achieve your commercial goals. If you own a bakery, it would be wise to choose the color red, which is known to make individuals feel hungry. Green is a color that can trigger emotions such as growth, health, and hope–perfect for a location that promotes wellness or sells plants. The color blue promotes the feeling of love, tranquility, acceptance, and understanding–perfect for a retail store that sells spa products or gifts. Yellow is known to boost a customer’s memory and can help them feel joyful, smart and organized–ideal for a store that sells stationery products or organization solutions. Use colors to produce emotions that complement your product line.
Retail space remodeling can be an intimidating process. However, as providers of Portland remodeling services, we here at Sitka Projects can say that retail owners who plan carefully achieve excellent remodeling results. Knowing your target audience and having a firm grasp on your goals for the customer experience are the first steps in making a mediocre retail space explode with life.
Most often than not grocery retail stores use grid layout that steers clients up and down aisles rows. A central grouping of displays is what a loop layout has, which has a circular or square pathway. One major advantage of the free-flowing design is that it gives merchants diverse opportunities to sufficient buying because customers can move with ease around the store.
There some store counters that separate the store owners from or the desk clerk from the customer but this system is very bad for the layout of a retail store because it creates an Us vs Them mentality and sends a wrong idea to the customers. If a counter is meant for paper work alone, it is important for the company to keep the desk at a low size.
Visibility of products is essential to the retail business therefore while considering retail store layout the firm store ensure the shelves are low enough to enable good visibility.
Even stunning in-store layouts fail to woo shoppers if the storefront has little curb appeal. Invest in an eye-catching entrance, strategically placing signage to entice customers inside. Make sure that at least a few products are visible to people who pass by the shop’s windows.
Finally, be sure that the retail store layout is attractive from all angles if multiple viewing angles are possible. This would be especially important in a window display that is also viewable from the store, or a display set in the middle of a showroom. Walk around the display, noticing the lighting, balance, and coloring from each angle. Make adjustments as necessary, so that your retail store display is visually appealing from all angles.",1
"World famous photographer Miles Aldridge has taken photographs of Arya Stark, Cersei Lannister, Daenerts Targaryen and other characters of “Games Of Thrones” in his own way, and it looks as strange as it looks fabulous.
“When pondering about how to capture each individual I wanted to recognize influences of themes in the show while seizing the traits of their own unique character, said the photographer.
Aldridge’s unique over-saturated style is evocative of Hollywood sets from the 40s-60s: its full of light, drama and intense colors. “The bright color story in each picture brings the viewers into the world that has been created for these actors while the cautious location and selection of each prop brings to lfe the dark and mystical world of The Game Of Thrones.”
The whole thing was photo’d with a Rolleiflex 6001 camera and a 120/180mm lens, set at f.16, and making use of Kodak Ektar 100 film.",1
"A new development in cat bonds is a glimpse into the future of paying for and settling risks.
A new development in cat bonds is a glimpse into the future of paying for and settling risks.
Financial markets are showing some signs of volatility these days after exceptionally low indicators since the start of the 2017. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, is at its highest level this year. The VVIX Index, which measures the volatility of volatility, is higher than it has been since August 2015.
Rising volatility does not mean catastrophe is imminent. There is one asset class, however, that takes a literally catastrophic view on the future, and it is booming: catastrophe bonds. Last week, the World Bank issued its largest-ever cat bond, offering as much as $360 million in payouts to Mexico in the event of tropical cyclones and earthquakes.
Catastrophe bonds are akin to insurance contracts. In a recent interview with Bloomberg Radio, Daniel Stander of Risk Management Solutions described a cat bond neatly: “a risk-linked security which transfers a specific set of risks from the issuer to the investor. The investor obviously takes on the risk of a specified event occurring in return for a rate of return. Should the qualifying event occur, then obviously the investors lose their principal that they’ve invested, and the issuer would receive that money to cover their anticipated losses.”
What events can form the basis for a cat bond? Stander again: “anything that you can measure which can act as a reliable proxy for a loss can be turned into a securitized bond.”
Cat bond issuance is at an all-time high: more than $10 billion in 2017.
Total cat bond risk capital outstanding is also at an all-time high of nearly $30 billion.
And as an asset class, cat bonds don’t perform badly! The Swiss Re Cat Bond Total Return Index has outperformed the basic benchmarks for equities, bonds and private equity. Look closely, and you can see that even major events such as the Great East Japan earthquake in March 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 register only as blips in an upward trend.
It’s not the volume or the total return on cat bonds as an asset class that I find most interesting, though. Rather, one characteristic and one new transaction allow us to imagine a different future of paying for and settling risks.
The important characteristic of cat bonds is that they can be parametric: An event within the parameters of the bond triggers a payout, rather than the results of that event initiating a process of insurance settlement. A cat bond on a Category 5 hurricane hitting Tampa, Florida, from Aug. 1 to Nov. 1 will pay out if a hurricane that strong hits that location during that period of time. Unlike an insurance contract for an asset, a parametric bond does not require a claims or investigation process before settlement … but it does still require settlement.
That’s where the new transaction -- and the blockchain -- come in. Last week saw the first-ever use of blockchain as the settlement mechanism in a cat bond. It is a neat and efficient use of blockchain’s distributed ledger capabilities (which allow settlement without an intermediary) and the parametric aspect of a cat bond (which triggers settlement without any claim). Settlement -- should it happen -- could take just seconds, and it would be transparent between parties.
There’s a final, and slightly scary, thought about blockchain settlement for cat bonds. We can think of blockchain settlement almost as a hedge against insurers themselves. In the event of a catastrophe so great that it disables even insurance settlement systems, the distributed ledger should still function without human engagement. Catastrophe bonds lay off the risks on assets; the blockchain lays off the risk on settlement.

"MUNCIE, Ind. --More than a dozen fraternities at Ball State University in Indiana won't have events that include alcohol for the rest of the year.
Interfraternity Council (IFC) President Trevor Holland said the decision was made with the university for the safety of their members and the community.
""It was a joint decision between chapter presidents and the university,"" Holland said.
The fraternities won't host or co-host any events with alcohol until Jan. 31, 2018, The Star Press reported.
CBS affiliate WTTV posted Holland's statement online saying in part that the IFC is a ""community of values"" and that ""change needs to happen.""
""We are taking the best steps to ensure the safety of our members and longevity of our organizations. I encourage chapters to use this time as a time of reflection, education and brotherhood,"" the statement read. ""As fraternity men, it's our time to truly embrace our organizations values and principles. Fraternity men are leaders on Ball State's campus and leaders impact change. I know that our community will react and grow stronger because of this agreement with the University.""
The decision, announced Monday, aims to correct behavior that was not consistent with the university's standards, said Kathy Wolf, vice president of marketing and communications for the university.
""It's not one single incident that has caused this,"" Wolf said. ""It's a trend or a pattern of behavior that is not acceptable or consistent with our Beneficence Pledge. As a result, what we're doing is pausing, if you will, and saying, 'Hey, together let's work on this.'""
Wolf said the fraternities will remain active and that its members will participate in classes that discuss alcohol use, hazing, bystander intervention and sexual assault.
""It's not about no frat parties, it's bigger than that,"" Wolf said. ""It's about having the right culture and that's why we're doing what we're doing.""
Wolf said the decision shows leadership and that fraternities are taking a stand.
The fraternities included are Alpha Tau Omega, Delta Tau Delta, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Sigma Kappa, Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi Epsilon and Theta Chi.",0

Growing cucumbers is an easy way to have access to healthy vegetables for your salads and soups. But, if you’re not growing your cucumbers vertically you could be missing out. Growing cucumbers vertically saves space, produces more veggies and makes it easier to harvest your bounty, according to North County Farmer.
If you want to save space and grow more veggies, follow these simple tips:
Choose a sunny location: Cucumbers hate the cold. Wait to plant your cucumbers outdoors until after the freezing weather has passed. Choose a sunny location for your plant.
Try a Trellis: To plant them vertically, use a trellis or wire cage. The plant will climb and it needs a place to grow. You can also use a tomato cage. Urban Organic Gardner notes that growing bush cucumbers could take up as much as 20 feet of land. Growing up takes far less space. Choose vining varieties instead.
You can grow them in a container: You can grow cucumbers in a container. You’ll want to add a post to the container to steady the vines.
Support matters: When growing your cucumbers vertically the most important thing to remember is that the vines need a sturdy support. Choose a sturdy base (like a trellis made of 2x4s) and always loosely secure the vines to the support until they grow sturdy enough to support themselves.
Water well: Cucumbers should be watered very well, regularly. This will protect the flavor of your cucumbers.
Watch the leaves: Cucumbers grow fast and they can produce a lot of vegetables. Regularly check under the leaves of the plant to see if a cucumber is growing. You don’t want to miss a veggie and have it go bad before you can use it.
What’s your favorite way to eat a cucumber? If you know someone who wants to try that hand at small space gardening, make sure to share these tips with them on Facebook.

"A new study in The Journal of School Healthhas found that alcohol is more likely to act as a gateway drug to substance abuse than marijuana.
Thestudy proves that marijuana consumption is not an indicator as to whether a person is likely to move onto harder drugs or not.
“By delaying the onset of alcohol initiation, rates of both licit substance abuse like tobacco and illicit substance use like marijuana and other drugs will be positively affected, and they’ll hopefully go down,”study co-authorAdam E. Barry, an assistant professor at the University of Florida’s Department of Health Education & Behavior, told Raw Story in an exclusive interview.
While Barry’s study shows evidence that substance abuse behaviors can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy by examining a subject’s drug history, he believes thatthe persistent and misguided notionof marijuana as the primary gatewayto more harmful substances went awry because its creators — who called it the “Stepping Stone Hypothesis” in the“Reefer Madness” era of the 1930s—fundamentally misread the data and failed to conduct an adequate follow-up.
“Some of these earlier iterations needed to be fleshed out,” Barry said. “That’s why we wanted to study this. The latest form of the gateway theory is that it begins with [marijuana] and moves on finally to what laypeople often call ‘harder drugs.’ As you can see from the findings of our study, it confirmed this gateway hypothesis, but it follows progression from licit substances, specifically alcohol, and moves on to illicit substances.”
“So, basically, if we know what someone says with regards to their alcohol use, then we should be able to predict what they respond to with other [drugs],” he explained. “Another way to say it is, if we know someone has done [the least prevalent drug] heroin, then we can assume they have tried all the others.”
And while that standardized progression certainly doesn’t fit every single drug user, the study took that into account too. “There were a low enough number of errors that you are able to accurately predict [future substance abuse behavior]… with about 92 percent accuracy,” Barry said.
By comparing substance abuse rates between drinkers and non-drinkers, they ultimately found that seniors in high school who had consumed alcohol at least once in their lives “were 13 times more likely to use cigarettes, 16 times more likely to use marijuana and other narcotics, and 13 times more likely to use cocaine.”
Barry also noted that the rates of tobacco and marijuana use among all 12th grade high school students were virtually the same, confirming a report the Centers for Disease Control publishedin June, and an analysis Raw Story published in May.
The study should give pause to anyone involved in youth drug awareness programs, as its findings suggest that making science-based alcohol education a top priority could actually turn the tide of the drug war — but only if lawmakers and leading educators decide to use that same science as a foundation for public policy and schoolcurriculum.
“I think [these results] have to do with level of access children have to alcohol, and that alcohol is viewed as less harmful than some of these other substances,” Barry added.
That social misconception, largely driven by the sheer popularity of alcohol and the profits it generates for private industry, is diametrically opposed to the most current science available on drug harms.A study published in 2010 in the medical journalLancetranked alcohol as the most harmful drug of all, above heroin, crack, meth, cocaine and tobacco. Even more striking: The Lancet study found that harms to others near the user were more than double those of the second most harmful drug, heroin.
In its last Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the CDC found (PDF) that about 71 percent of American students have had at least one alcoholic beverage in their lifetime, and almost 39 percent reported having at least one drink within the last 30 days.
“This is a time of budget tightening,” Barry concluded. “Many social services are being cut. If you take [our findings] and apply them to a school health setting, we believe that you are going to get the best bang for your buck by focusing on alcohol.”",1
"Racially offensive trademark applications are piling up at the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Supreme Court decided last month the federal government couldn't ban trademarks simply because they're disparaging. NPR's Planet Money team talks to some of the people trying to trademark racial slurs.
Racially offensive trademark applications are piling up at the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Supreme Court decided last month the federal government couldn't ban trademarks simply because they're disparaging. NPR's Planet Money team talks to some of the people trying to trademark racial slurs.
Racial slurs can now be registered as trademarks - theoretically, at least. The Supreme Court decided in June that the government can no longer ban a trademark simply because it's disparaging. Ailsa Chang from NPR's Planet Money podcast talked to some people who are now trying to trademark slurs. A warning - her report includes some very offensive words. They're important to the story, though, because that sort of language is what this debate is all about. The piece runs just under four minutes. Here it is.
AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: Ed Timberlake is a trademark lawyer who's convinced the floodgates have opened. To him, what the Supreme Court has done is given the bigots of the world a green light to register the most disgusting trademarks ever. He's been making a list of all the trademark applications filed the last five weeks since the court's decision.
CHANG: Wow. Wait; how many niggas did you just list off there?
TIMBERLAKE: There - at least five here, and there are probably more since then.
CHANG: So at least five have been filed since the Supreme Court decision?
TIMBERLAKE: Yes - a couple on the day of the Supreme Court decision.
I decided to track down whoever filed those two applications for N-I-G-G-A on the same day the Supreme Court decision came down. Whoever it was, they were clearly determined, poised to pounce and own this word before anyone else. And it turns out both of those applications that day were filed by the same man.
CURTIS BORDENAVE: I'm in Columbus, Miss., right near the Alabama state line.
CHANG: Curtis Bordenave calls himself a consultant who helps businesses develop product lines and brands. He's filed a ton of trademark applications over the years, but trademarking nigga was about something very personal.
BORDENAVE: I thought that I had a duty - you know what I'm saying? - and a responsibility to protect that word, to secure that word - you know what I'm saying? - and to make sure that it's used in a way that I think would not disparage people.
CHANG: The race to trademark nigga is a race against the racists. Bordenave, who's African-American, plans to sell T-shirts that celebrate themes like unity and brotherhood, hoping people will connect those ideas with the nigga brand. It's his way of reclaiming the word. And he says he's glad he filed his trademark applications immediately because a few days later, another guy applied to trademark the same word. And what gave Bordenave a bad feeling was that guy also applied to trademark the swastika the very same week.
BORDENAVE: I don't know that party's intent. It doesn't seem like a good intent to want to have those two marks together.
CHANG: I wondered about the intent, too, so I set off to find this other guy. And he turned out to be a patent lawyer in Alexandria, Va., Steve Maynard.
STEVE MAYNARD: Because the term has an incendiary meaning behind it.
MAYNARD: And it's currently used as a symbol of hate. And if we can own the brand, we will be able to control the sale of the brand and the use of the brand as well.
CHANG: Oh, so you're trying to basically grab the swastika so real, actual racists and haters can't grab the swastika as a...
CHANG: But there's a catch. Maynard can't just get the trademark, put it in a drawer and make sure nobody else uses it. To keep a trademark, he actually needs to sell a swastika product. So he will - blankets, shirts, flags. But he plans to make these products so expensive he's hoping no one will ever buy them.
MAYNARD: If you want to buy that swastika flag, you've got to buy it through us. And it's going to be a thousand dollars each.
CHANG: This pre-emptive strike against bigotry still has strategic flaws. You get trademark registration only if you can show consumers will connect your trademark with you, the maker of the product. The swastika and all its history is so ingrained in people's minds already, it's unlikely anyone would ever connect the symbol to a brand of blankets. So Maynard probably won't get that trademark. But then again, neither will anyone else. Ailsa Chang, NPR News.
[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we say that a few days after Curtis Bordenave filed an application to register ""Nigga"" as a trademark, Steve Maynard's Snowflake Enterprises LLC applied to do the same thing. In fact, Bordenave's first application to trademark the word was filed on June 19, 2017, the day of the Supreme Court decision. Later that same day, Maynard's Snowflake Enterprises filed an application. Bordenave filed a second application to register ""Nigga"" on June 19. Then on June 27, Maynard's Snowflake Enterprises filed two more applications to register the word.]

"More than one million people have decided they will no longer buy their Nutter Butters or Wet Wipes at Target.
The American Family Association launched a boycott of the nation’s second largest retailer a week ago – over Target’s corporate policy allowing men who identify as women to use the bathrooms and fitting rooms of their choosing.
Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives!
“We believe that everyone – every team member, every guest, and every community – deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally,” the company wrote in a statement. “Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination.”
American Family Association, one of the most prominent and respected family advocacy groups in the nation, warned that Target’s policy puts women and children in danger.
“Nearly everyone has a mother, wife, daughter or friend who is put in jeopardy by this policy,” AFA President Tim Wildmon said. “Predators and voyeurs would take advantage of the policy to prey on those who are vulnerable.”
And it’s pretty clear that more than a million customers agree with the American Family Association.
“Everybody knows it’s wrong for men to use the same bathrooms and fitting rooms with little girls,” Wildmon told me. “Target has decided they don’t care about the vast majority. They only care about the tiny, tiny minority.”
The American Family Association stressed that their boycott has nothing to do with the transgender community.
“We want to make it very clear that AFA does not believe the transgender community poses this danger to the wider public,” Wildmon said. “Rather, this misguided and reckless policy provides a possible gateway for predators who are out there.”
I’ve never been one to tell you how to spend your hard-earned money. It’s not my place. But I don’t mind telling you that the Starnes family has joined the boycott.
Granted, Target has every right to determine its corporate policies. But I also have a right to buy my Cocoa Puffs at a place that respects common sense.
For the sake of inclusivity, would Target allow a 16-year-old who identifies as a 21-year-old to purchase a six-pack of beer? Would Target provide a senior citizen discount to a 30-year-old who identifies as a 70-year-old?
Wildmon told me the Target boycott struck a nerve with a significant section of the country. Many people have grown tired of Hollywood and Big Business trying to bully and intimidate local governments.
“Corporate America must stop bullying people who disagree with the radical Left agenda to remake society into their progressive image,” he said. “This boycott is a reaction to the bullying we’ve seen in places like North Carolina and Mississippi.”
Among the most vocal supporters of AFA’s boycott is evangelical leader Franklin Graham.
“A man shouldn’t be able to enter the women’s restroom or dressing room because he says he ‘feels like a woman today,’” Graham wrote on Facebook. “That’s ridiculous. The fact is, gender identity isn’t something we choose or feel. We are the sex God created us to be – male or female. How a person feels doesn’t change the facts.”
It’s as if an anatomical fog has rolled across the fruited plain – causing befuddlement in bathroom stalls from coast to coast.
So perhaps I can provide some clarity to the Great Latrine Wars of 2016. Those of you with man-parts should use the men’s room and those of you with lady-parts should use the ladies room.
I suspect that right about now you’re probably thinking your friendly neighborhood columnist is a bit politically incorrect. Well, it’s true – I am.
When I was growing up we just had boys and girls (him and her, not ze and zir). Our bathroom choices were limited to our God-given plumbing.
So maybe Target ought to consider going old school.
It’s pretty much a fool-proof system -- unless you happen to be at Long John Silver’s – and then the men should use the buoys room and the ladies should use the gull’s room.
And no matter if you identify as a him or her or ze or zir -- be sure to courtesy flush.",0

"(Before It's News)Scientists from the University of Birmingham and Norwich Research Park have discovered a link between a major mechanism of antibiotic resistance and resistance to the disinfectant triclosan which is commonly found in domestic products.
Researchers made the unexpected finding that bacteria that mutated to become resistant to quinolone antibiotics also became more resistant to triclosan.
The scientists showed that the quinolone-resistance mutation altered the way the bacteria package their DNA inside a cell and that these mutants had also turned on various self-defence mechanisms – together these gave triclosan resistance.
(Before It's News)Scientists from the University of Birmingham and Norwich Research Park have discovered a link between a major mechanism of antibiotic resistance and resistance to the disinfectant triclosan which is commonly found in domestic products.
Researchers made the unexpected finding that bacteria that mutated to become resistant to quinolone antibiotics also became more resistant to triclosan.
The scientists showed that the quinolone-resistance mutation altered the way the bacteria package their DNA inside a cell and that these mutants had also turned on various self-defence mechanisms – together these gave triclosan resistance.
Quinolone antibiotics are an important and powerful group of human medicines, and this new discovery raises concerns that the use of triclosan can give antimicrobial resistance.
The research, carried out at the Institute of Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham in collaboration with The Quadram Instituteand John Innes Centre based at Norwich Research Park, was published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.
Corresponding author Dr Mark Webber, from the Quadram Institute and Honorary Senior Lecturer at the University of Birmingham, said: “We think that bacteria are tricked into thinking they are always under attack and are then primed to deal with other threats including triclosan.
“The worry is that this might happen in reverse and triclosan exposure might encourage growth of antibiotic resistant strains.
“We found this can happen in E. coli. As we run out of effective drugs, understanding how antibiotic resistance can happen and under what conditions is crucial to stopping selection of more resistant bacteria.”
Co-author Professor Laura Piddock, of the Institute of Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham, said: “The link between quinolone and triclosan resistance is important as triclosan has become ubiquitous in the environment and even human tissues in the last 20 years”.
“Given the prevalence of triclosan and other antimicrobials in the environment, a greater understanding of the impact they can have on bacteria and how exposure to these antimicrobials may impact the selection and spread of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance is needed.”
Professor Tony Maxwell, from the John Innes Centre, said: “This work shows the power of combining the expertise from the different teams working in Norwich and Birmingham to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, which is a serious and increasing problem in the UK and elsewhere.”
In the last decade there has been an explosion in the marketing of products aimed at the home market labelled as ‘antimicrobial’.
There is also largely a lack of evidence for additional benefits of these products over traditional cleaning and hygiene products (e.g. bleach, soap and water).
There has, however, been concern raised that the active antimicrobial ingredients for some of these products are accumulating in the environment where they are altering ecosystems and potentially promoting selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria.
Triclosan, in particular, has been the cause for some concern which has led to a ban across the EU and now USA in its use in hygiene products (hand, skin and body washes). Many other antimicrobial agents are, however, still used in these products.

"When Nevada woman Wendy Littlefield started using her NutriBullet 900 blending machine, she was excited to give the trendy kitchen appliance a full test run. But when the device “suddenly malfunctioned” and exploded, the spinning blades went flying and chopped apart her right hand.
Because the Magic Bullet failed while attempting to blend some canned tomatoes and beans, Wendy is suing the fashionable company.
As seen in the emergency room photographs, Wendy’s injuries were extensive. She was left with deep cuts and severe nerve damage. She asserts the damage was a result of negligence on part of Homeland Housewares, who manufactures the popular kitchen gadget.
Based on her experience, Wendy claims that the company should have known that their products were “unreasonably dangerous and defective when used for its intended use.”
Her lawsuit demands compensation, which she believes she is entitled to. These will come in addition to general damages for pain, suffering, emotional distress, and disfigurement.
Attorneys at Abir Cohen Treyzon Salo, LLP have stepped up to represent Wendy in her lawsuit. She has accrued medical and hospital bills and will require more medical attention in the future as she rehabilitates from her Magic Bullet related injury.
Her husband Darryl is also getting involved in the lawsuit. Because of his wife’s injury, he asserts, their “marital association has been altered.”
He claims to have suffered “mental anguish” because he witness his wife’ horrific injury.
And Wendy? Her daughter and beauty pageant winner, Cambrie, writing on Facebook, says: “My mother’s life will never be the same, considering she will likely never be able to use her dominant hand again and she rides a roller coaster of never-ending pain and constant surgeries. This is a tragedy I hope no one else has to endure.”
The kitchen gadget is a vital piece to helping thousands reach their New Year’s health resolutions because it can smash fruits, vegetables, and nuts into healthy, nutritious smoothies. But apparently, if something goes wrong, it can ruin lives too.
Cambrie added, along with a link to the story about her mother’s injury: “Within seconds, our lives have changed forever! Please share!”
What do you think? Daily Mail readers shared thoughts including:
“So one machine malfunctions and every unit is unreasonably dangerous! If one car out of millions had a fault does it make them all unreasonably dangerous? Compensation is all this about!”
“Sums up all that’s wrong with the system in America … trying to construe all sorts of issues to milk a bit more money out of the manufacturer (no doubt to try to get them to settle… with very little proof they have done anything wrong)”
“Vitamix is guaranteed for life and the engineering is superb.. These small gadgets can be easily taxed.”
Do you think she will win her lawsuit? Or is she trying too hard to get some extra pocket money from the manufacturer?

Avocados are an absolute hit in the last few years, and these delicious fruits are added to all kinds of recipes.
Yet, this is a highly beneficial thing regarding the fact that avocados are incredibly healthy, and contain high amounts of fiber, healthy fats, potassium, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin K, and vitamin E.
However, this trend has also increased the prices by more than 25% in the last year. Therefore, we offer you an alternative to save money and still enjoy these delicious fruits.
Namely, you can grow your own, organic avocados at home in a simple and easy way. Get yourself ready and grow your avocado tree from a seed!
Yes, you read it right- you need just a seed! Clean it well, and stick 4 toothpicks into it at equal distances. Then, put it into a glass of water, soaking in an inch of water.
Place the glass in a warm place, but not exposed to a direct sunlight, until the stem has grown to six inches and the roots are visible. This will take about 2-6 weeks.
Then, cut the stem back to 3 inches, and wait until it grows again and more leaves appear.
Next, get a big pot with about 10 inches in diameter, with a small hole in the bottom for drainage. You should fill it with nutrient- rich soil. Remember to make a small hole in the top of the compost and place the seed inside, but not too deep.
Then, place the pot into a sunny area, and water it regularly. If the leaves of the tree become dry and brown, it means that it is not properly hydrated, so you should, put the pot in the sink, turn the tap on and allow the water to run through the soil for a few moments.
On the other hand, you are overwatering it if the leaves become yellow and droop, so you should not water it for a few days.
The proper care of the tree will make it flourish, but it might need a few years before it begins to bear fruit. Yet, when this happens, you can enjoy these tasty and nutritious fruits on a daily basis, for free!

"There is a giant baby towering over part of the barrier wall along the U. S.-Mexico border. It's a cutout of a black-and-white image of a 1-year-old Mexican boy - his face and hands. He has thick, dark hair and looks as though he's about to smile. This enormous image is supported by wooden scaffolding. It's made to look as though the boy is holding onto the top of the wall and peering over it. He's on the Mexico side in Tecate, peering over at California.
The installation went up this week. It's by the French street artist who goes only by JR. He's known for pasting large portraits on walls and facades all over the world. We reached him in Los Angeles today to talk about his new project on the Mexico border.
JR: The wall is 21 feet high, and we've built the piece to be 64 feet high. So basically we had to build a bigger wall to make this wall look ridiculous.
SHAPIRO: Why did you want to make this wall look ridiculous? Was that the ultimate goal?
JR: No, actually, you know how it started? I dream about walls. I - that's, you know - I'm sure you maybe dream about radio stations and microphones.
JR: I have no idea. I dream about walls because that's what I paste all day. Now, not necessarily wall that divides people, but I dream about walls I can paste maybe because we hear about this wall constantly in the media recently because of some guy wanted to make it bigger. I don't know.
SHAPIRO: Some guy - the president of the United States, you mean.
JR: I woke up, and I was like, wow, I think I imagine a little kid looking over. And in my head, I remember the first thing I thought was, what is he thinking? What a kid that's 1-year-old is actually thinking because he's looking over the wall, but he have no idea that's a wall that divides people. He have no idea of the political context.
So anyway, that sight started. And I went there with some friends, and we started scouting. And we knocked at the first house that was living right by the wall on the Mexican side. And the woman come out, and you know, she followed me on Facebook, which is crazy. It's like, are you sure...
JR: 'Cause I'm doing wallpaper - you sure that's me? And she said, no, no, I follow you. And I was like, OK, look; I'm doing this art project, and I would, you know - we're looking for location. You can use my house. You can use, you know, the side of the - of my house, too. And I was like, thank you. It's actually, you know, too close from the wall. I need a bit more distance. But we'll come back if we do it in the region. We'll let you know. Then we left.
But when we were driving away, I remember there was a little kid looking at us the whole time in his little, you know, crib and with the two hands on the side of the crib looking at us. And I was like, damn, he looked exactly like that kid I dreamed of.
JR: He could be perfect for the project. So we drove back there, asked the mom and said, look; I know we don't even have a rendering or anything of how the project would look, but can I photograph your kid? And when I have the idea ready, I will come back to you and show it to you. Let me know if you agree. And she said of course. And that's how it basically happened.
SHAPIRO: So this child actually is a 1-year-old child who lives right next to the wall.
JR: Oh, yeah. He actually looks over the wall every day.
SHAPIRO: This went up the same week that President Trump announced he is winding down the program called DACA that protects undocumented immigrants who came to the U. S. as children. You've obviously been planning this piece for much longer than that. What do you make of the timing?
JR: You know, for me as an artist, I raise questions. I don't give answers. So I came there to learn more. And to, you know, create a public discussion and to talk with the locals and - on both sides. And yeah, when that came up, we were actually pasting. And we were like, wow. And then suddenly a lot of people started writing me on Instagram and say, hey, you know, I'm a DACA; this means so much for me.
But what I was the most touch of is that most of the people - if you read the comments, they were not talking politics, or they didn't mention the name of the president. It was about people. The mother of the kid told me, I hope this piece will make people realize that we are not animals. We are not criminals. We are not all, like, rapists.
SHAPIRO: I was going to ask you, what did this mother say when she saw her child peering over the wall that she lives right next to?
JR: The mother of the kid told me - she said, look; you know, it's my son. I can recognize him. But I hope for the others, you know, it represents any kid, any person, anyone that have dreams and dreams that are not alienated by any political vision or any prejudice. And you know, I couldn't wish better for the start of a discussion.
SHAPIRO: JR, I know this image has given a lot of delight to people during a week when we could all use it, so thank you for that. And thank you for talking with us.
JR: Thank you so much.

"Take a peek in your closet or basement and you’ll likely come across plenty of items that you haven’t used in years. The t-shirt from your high school musical, a dress you wore to a wedding five years ago (and will probably never fit into again), an old pair of roller blades you never use. The thing is, plenty of us have trouble tossing things — and there are two main reasons why.
The biggest one is our need for safety, security and stability, says Dr. Frank Niles, PhD, social scientist and life and business strategist. This could very well explain why you can’t part with the panini maker you bought 11 years ago, even though it’s barely seen the light of day.
“You may think, ‘I’ve used this tool one time and I may never use it again — but what if I need it in the future? I want to be able to have that thing at that time to address that need,’” says Niles.
Secondly, our desire to hold onto piles and piles of old mementos can often be blamed on nostalgia. That’s because reminiscing about the past makes us feel good. “It can lead to increased feelings of social connectedness,” says Niles. “If I have a photo of parents who have passed away, looking at it can elicit positive emotions.”",0

We basically live in the future, so why are you still vacuuming your own home?
I'm not suggesting you hire a cleaning service or anything like that. But a robot vacuum can be a solid investment to keep your floors pristine and save you the aggravation of this oft-dreaded chore.
There are loads of affordable models to choose from whether you've got high pile carpets or all wood floors. Take the ECOVACS DEEBOT N78, for instance.
This robot vacuum is designed to grab long fibers (a.k.a. pet hair) without getting tangled and clogging the machine. It only costs $180 on Amazon, which is already a bargain price for an efficient robot vacuum. But you can use our exclusive code (MXNKBFH7) to knock an additional $45 off the price to get this vacuum for $135.
The DEEBOT N78 is ideal for a household with pets (or people who happen to leave strands of hair everywhere they go). The suction mechanism, as pictured above, is designed to detangle hairs it picks up by pulling them directing into the dust bin. That means no plucking hair balls out of the intake, and no worry of the vacuum malfunctioning mid-cycle. It has a number of other great features too:
 3 cleaning modes: Auto, spot cleaning, and edge cleaning
 110-minute run time on a single charge
 Automatically returns to charging station when battery gets low
 3 groups of sensors to prevent the vacuum from banging into your furniture
 A remote control to program and control the robot vacuum
 Automated cleaning schedules to keep things tidy even if you're not home

Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were ""resolved"" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

If you're thinking of buying an all-electric or hybrid car, here are a few things to consider.     USA TODAYA car is connected to a charging station for electric vehicles in Hamburg, Germany. Major automakers say their joint European electric car recharging network will open its first stations this year in Germany, Austria and Norway in what the companies hope will be a big step toward mass acceptance of battery-powered cars. FRANKFURT, Germany — A group of major automakers plans to open hundreds of fast-charging stations for electric cars in Europe in coming years and use a common plug technology in what they hope will be a big step toward mass acceptance of battery-powered vehicles.BMW, Daimler, Ford and the Volkswagen Group with its Audi and Porsche brands have equal shares in the venture, Ionity, plans for which were first announced last year.They said Friday that they will open the first of 20 stations this year in Germany, Austria and Norway at 75-mileintervals along major roads. They plan to expand the network to more than 100 stations next year and have about 400 in place across Europe by 2020.The founding companies said ""other automotive manufacturers are invited to help expand the network.""More: $7,500 electric car tax credit goes away under GOP plan. Not good for Tesla.More: Analysis: Tesla looks to dominate China’s EV marketThe aim is to make it easier for electric cars to travel long distances and render them more appealing to the mass market. Hours-long charging times have meant battery-powered cars are limited to use for short commutes and local shopping trips. Owners typically recharge overnight at home or in an employer's parking lot during the day. That has left battery cars as a second vehicle in some first-adopter households, with a conventional car kept for longer journeys. The chance to charge up fast far from home would make it possible to take an electric vehicle on a family vacation.A typical electric car can take several hours to charge from empty using a 7 kilowatt-hour home plug. The Ionity network stations by contrast will have charging capacity of up to 350 kilowatts per hour. That's aimed at the future because currently available car cannot charge at that speed. A BMW i3 electric would take 30 minutes to fast-charge at its maximum of 50 kilowatts per hour; at 350 kilowatts per hour, in theory the time could be cut to under 10 minutes. The hope is, drivers could charge in the time it takes to have a cup of coffee at the recharging station.A plug is shown at a charging station for electric vehicles in Hamburg, Germany. Major automakers say their joint European electric car recharging network will open its first stations this year in Germany, Austria and Norway in what the companies hope will be a big step toward mass acceptance of battery-powered cars.(Photo: Daniel Bockwoldt, AP)The new network will also use a standardized plug — the CCS, or Combined Charging System standard — that isn't tied to any one car maker.The new network will set up the stations in partnership with operators of rest areas and gas stations in the three countries.A pan-European fast-charging network ""plays an essential role in establishing a market for electric vehicles,"" Ionity CEO Michael Hajesch said in a statement.Uptake of electric cars across Europe has been patchy so far. Electrically chargeable vehicles were only 1.2% of European car sales in the second quarter, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Norway, where the government has aggressively pushed for low-emissions vehicles, is an exception with 29% market share for electrically chargeable vehicles. By contrast, Greece registered only 32 rechargeable cars last year.The higher cost of the vehicles is a key reason, on top of limited range and lack of places to charge up, and for now government subsidies and tax breaks are important to supporting sales. Analysts say that electric vehicles may become more affordable as battery costs fall.Automakers are sinking billions into developing electric cars in part as a response to ever-tougher limits on air pollution and carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas blamed for global warming.The new company will be headquartered in Munich, Germany, and have 50 employees by the start of 2018.

"Today the sun is shining during my commute home from work. But this weekend, public service announcements will remind us to “fall back,” ending daylight saving time by setting our clocks an hour earlier on Sunday, Nov. 5. On Nov. 6, many of us will commute home in the dark.
This semiannual ritual shifts our rhythms and temporarily makes us groggy at times when we normally feel alert. Moreover, many Americans are confused about why we spring forward in March and fall back in November, and whether it is worth the trouble.
The practice of resetting clocks is not designed for farmers, whose plows follow the sun regardless of what time clocks say it is. And it does not create extra daylight – it simply shifts when the sun rises and sets relative to society’s regular schedule and routines.
The key question is how people respond to this enforced shift. Most people have to be at work at a certain time – say, 8:30 a.m. – and if that time comes an hour earlier, they simply get up an hour earlier. The effect on society is another question. Here, the research shows that daylight saving time is more burden than boon.
Benjamin Franklin was one of the first thinkers to endorse the idea of making better use of daylight. Although he lived well before the invention of light bulbs, Franklin observed that people who slept past sunrise wasted more candles later in the evening. He also whimsically suggested the first policy fixes to encourage energy conservation: firing cannons at dawn as public alarm clocks, and fining homeowners who put up window shutters.
To this day, our laws equate daylight saving with energy conservation. However, recent research suggests that it actually increases energy use.
This is what I found in a study co-authored with Yale economist Matthew Kotchen. We used a policy change in Indiana to estimate daylight saving time’s effects on electricity consumption. Prior to 2006, most Indiana counties did not observe it. By comparing households’ electricity demand before and after daylight saving time was adopted, month by month, we showed that it had actually increased residential electricity demand in Indiana by 1 to 4 percent annually.
The largest effects occurred in the summer – when shifting clocks forward aligns our lives with the hottest part of the day, so that people tend to use more air conditioning – and late fall, when we wake up in a cold dark house and use more heating, with no reduction in lighting needs.
Other studies corroborate these findings. Research in Australia and in the United States shows that daylight saving time does not decrease total energy use. However, it does smooth out peaks and valleys in energy demand throughout the day, as people at home use more electricity in the morning and less during the afternoon. Though people still use more electricity, shifting the timing reduces average costs to deliver energy because not everyone demands it during typical peak usage periods.
Daylight saving time proponents also argue that changing times provides more hours for afternoon recreation and reduces crime rates. The best time for recreation is a matter of preference. However, there is better evidence on crime rates: Fewer muggings and sexual assaults occur during daylight saving time months because fewer potential victims are out after dark.
Overall, net benefits from these three durational effects of crime, recreation and energy use – that is, impacts that last for the duration of the time change – are murky.
Other consequences of daylight saving time are ephemeral. I think of them as bookend effects, since they occur when we change our clocks.
When we “spring forward” in March we lose an hour, which comes disproportionately from resting hours rather than wakeful time. Therefore, many problems associated with springing forward stem from sleep deprivation. With less rest, people make more mistakes, which appear to cause more traffic accidents and workplace injuries, lower workplace productivity due to cyberloafing and poorer stock market trading.
Even when we gain that hour back in the fall, we must readjust our routines over several days because the sun and our alarm clocks feel out of synchronization, much like jet lag. Some impacts are serious: During bookend weeks, children in higher latitudes go to school in the dark, which increases the risk of pedestrian casualties. Dark commutes are so problematic for pedestrians that New York City is repeating the “Dusk and Darkness” safety campaign that it launched in 2016. And heart attacks increase after the spring time shift – it is thought because of lack of sleep – but decrease to a lesser extent after the fall shift. Collectively, these bookend effects represent net costs and strong arguments against retaining daylight saving time.
Spurred by many of these arguments, at least 16 states have considered changes to daylight saving time this year. Some bills would end daylight saving time, while others would make it permanent. For example, Massachusetts is studying whether to move in coordination with other New England states to Atlantic Time, joining Canada’s Maritime provinces one hour ahead of Eastern Standard Time. If they shift, travelers flying from Los Angeles to Boston would cross five time zones.
Some states have good reason for diverging from the norm. Notably, Hawaii does not practice daylight saving time because it is much closer to the equator than the rest of the nation, so its daylight hours barely change throughout the year. Arizona is the sole contiguous state that abstains from daylight saving time, citing its extreme summer temperatures. Although this disparity causes confusion for western travelers, the state’s residents have not changed clocks’ times for over 40 years.
In my research I have found that everyone has strong opinions about daylight saving time. Many people welcome the shift in March as a signal of spring. Others like the coordinated availability of daylight after work. Dissenters, including farmers, curse their loss of quiet morning hours.
When the evidence about costs and benefits is mixed but we need to make coordinated choices, how should we make decisions? The strongest arguments, with the exception of energy costs, support not only doing away with the switches but keeping the nation on daylight saving time year-round. This provides the benefits of after- work sun without the schedule disruptions. Yet humans adapt. If we abandon the twice-yearly switch, we may eventually slide back into old routines and habits of sleeping in during daylight. Daylight saving time is the coordinated alarm to wake us up a bit earlier in the summer and get us out of work with more sunshine.

"Apple has packed the iPhone X with enough cool technology that it appears destined to become Apple’s most important iPhone since it “reinvented the phone” a decade ago.
The iPhone X (pronounced ""ten"") is being hailed as a futuristic iPhone that Apple is delivering now, say analysts. “Given that the iPhone X represents such a big departure from existing Apple design…it’ll take Apple at least 2 years to refine the technology and components before making the iPhone X mainstream,” Wayne Lam, IHS Markit analyst, told Fox News via email.
Lam said that while the iPhone 8 ""is clearly an evolution or refinement"" of what has served Apple well in the past, the iPhone X is much more than that. ""The iPhone X [is] intended to showcase the design language Apple wants to use for the next decade,” he added.
So, what makes the iPhone X so special – and pricey (it starts at $999) to buy?
Here are five of the best features of the upcoming iPhone.
The notch:That very conspicuous notch at the top of the iPhone X display is jam-packed with sensors, chips, and cameras and houses “the most sophisticated technology” Apple has ever developed, including the hardware that enables Face ID.
For starters, inside the notch there’s the 7-megapixel “selfie” camera. But what makes the notch special is other stuff like the “Dot Projector” that throws out more than 30,000 invisible dots onto your face to build a facial map. There is also a “Flood Illuminator” that uses invisible infrared light to identify your face when it’s dark.
Face ID: More than any single thing, this is what everyone is talking about. Touch ID is Apple’s past and Face ID is the future. Face ID allows you to unlock the phone and make payments based on a detailed depth map of your face.
It's unclear if Apple can execute, as the product, slated to ship Nov. 3, has not been reviewed yet. But when face recognition works well, it’s amazing. HP's EliteBook x360 laptop with Windows 10 Hello, for example, uses a series of infrared cameras to do an instant unlock by scanning your face in a variety of lighting and facial conditions. And it works as advertised.
Once you use a well-executed face recognition system, there’s no going back to touch.
WILL APPLE'S NEW FACE ID SECURITY FEATURE HELP COPS UNLOCK YOUR IPHONE?
Different display: Physically, the 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display is what makes the iPhone X so different.
In addition to being Apple’s first OLED and its largest smartphone display yet, the display fills the entire front of the phone, effectively eradicating the bezels. In a video discussing the iPhone X, Apple's chief design officer Jony Ive said, “For more than a decade, our intention is to create an iPhone that is all display.”
Save the notch, Apple pretty much achieved that.
Best camera yet:The rear camera is Apple’s most advanced, besting even the iPhone 8 Plus’ advanced camera.
Both the iPhone X and iPhone 8 Plus have 12-megapixel wide-angle and telephoto cameras with optical zoom. But the iPhone X has improved telephoto aperture (f/2.4 on the iPhone X vs. f/2.8 on the iPhone 8 Plus -- for photo buffs out there). That makes the iPhone X better in low-light conditions. It also has dual optical image stabilization, whereas the 8 Plus has optical image stabilization only on the wide angle.
A11 Bionic chip:Apple has become a world-class processor designer. And Apple is trying to drive that home with a new Bionic processor that has a neural engine capable of up to 600 billion operations per second.
The neural engine is used for machine learning (artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from observation) and is designed to handle the super-fast computations needed to recognize people, places and objects.",0
"This remedy comes with two amazingly effective natural ingredients – coconut oil and baking soda. As we all know, baking soda is a very strong, all-round ingredient that is utilized in many different ways.
For instance, people use baking soda to prepare different baked goods and for some household chores when they need natural polishing and deodorizing product.
In addition, some of them use baking soda as a cleaning product, as a replacement for toxic and harmful commercial cleaners.
What is even more interesting is that baking soda has been used a beauty product for skin, teeth and hair for a long time.
It provides outstanding results in healing acne because baking soda is an amphoteric compound which means that is has ability to regular pH levels of the skin and protects people from imbalance which ultimately results in acne.
Coconut oil is helpful too because it has strong moisturizing, healing and antibacterial properties. It is a well-known natural product for preserving and promoting skin health.
It worked on 77 percent customers. Click Here!

Two teaspoons of extra virgin coconut oil
One teaspoon of baking soda (free of aluminum).

We hope that this simple recipe will help your skin.",1
"If you are one of the growing number of consumers who prefer to buy computers, software and electronic goods online then you should get a fairer deal from this month after an intervention from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).
Following action from the OFT,  dabs.com was among a number of firms who agreed to change their terms and conditions, which previously misled consumers about their right to return goods and get a refund.
The amended contract is set to serve as a model for the online IT market - it is unthinkable other suppliers would carry on using the offending terms.
The amended terms and conditions include those that made the consumer pay the cost of carriage when returning faulty goods, imposed time limits for reporting defects, and refunds being conditional on the return of cancelled goods. A further condition excluded the company's liability for errors in the descriptions of goods.
Ray Hall, director of the  OFT, said: ""The office welcomes the changes made by Dabs - consumers now have fairer and clearer terms and conditions.
""IT suppliers that sell to consumers online, by mail order, or telephone must make sure their consumer contracts do not limit consumers' rights.""
Know your rights
Online shoppers have stronger rights than those buying from a high street retailer due to the  Distance Selling Regulations (DSRs), which came into force in October 2000.
These state that consumers must be given clear information before they buy, including details of the goods or services offered, delivery and payment arrangements, the name and address of a supplier - crucial information if you're buying a PC and might need to contact a firm if a problem arises - and information about your right to cancel.
Online shoppers have the unconditional right to cancel an order within a seven day cooling-off period starting the day after delivery. You do not have this right if you buy from a shop. The right to cancel is in addition to your statutory right to reject faulty or misdescribed goods under the  Sale of Goods Act.
If you do cancel an order the trader must refund your money, as soon as possible and within 30 days at the latest.
You may be required to send back the goods and pay the costs of doing so, but only if you were told about this in writing before making the contract. If you fail to return the goods and your contract requires it, the trader can charge you for the cost of recovering them. But the refund can never be made conditional on you returning the goods - your right to a refund is absolute whether you return the goods or not.
Bear in mind also that you can never be made responsible for the cost of returning faulty goods or substitute goods, which have been supplied where the ordered goods are not available. In these cases the cost of returning the items and arrangements for their collection must be borne by the trader.
In all cases, however, you are under a duty of care to look after the goods while they are in your possession. You must also make them available for collection on receiving written notice from the trader. If you send them back you should package them carefully, ensure they are correctly addressed and use a reliable delivery service.
Exceptions to the rules
If the goods are made to your own specification or clearly personalised the agreement is not covered by the rules. This also means the cooling off period might not apply if you order a computer manufactured to a unique design. Importantly, though, a relatively standard product such as a PC assembled from a standard range of components is not exempt, so don't let the trader use this as an excuse for denying your right to cancel.
Most computer software is sealed and needs to be unsealed before use. If you break the seal on any software you buy you lose the right to cancel and the DSRs no longer apply. However, you should be told about this in writing before you enter into the contract. You should also be informed about the main characteristics of the software, including the hardware requirements and any limitations to the software's functionality.
If you opt for a separate add-on service contract for installing your computer or for support and repairs, you must be told in writing about your right to cancel this contract as well as the goods contract. But the cancellation period for goods and services might not always be the same. If you consent to a service starting before the end of the usual seven working day cancellation period, your right to cancel is terminated once the work starts.
Don't forget you have the legal right to claim a refund plus the cost of returning the goods from the trader if they are faulty or misdescribed. Whatever a contract says, these rights can never be taken away from you. You are entitled to insist on financial compensation and do not have to accept a credit note. Also, the trader cannot avoid giving a refund by blaming the manufacturer - responsibility always rests with the trader.
Don't delay your complaint for too long as you might be judged to have accepted the goods if you leave it more than a few weeks after delivery. In these circumstances the right to a refund might be lost, but you can ask for a repair or replacement instead. However, if you agree to let the trader try to fix faulty goods this would not affect your rights. If the repair fails you can still reject the goods and claim a refund. When buying online it is important to get the geographical address of the trader - you will need it if you want to complain, and your rights can vary depending on where the trade is based.
You cannot assume an internet trader is based in the UK simply because the web address has "".co.uk"" in it. Although EU countries have similar legislation to the UK the law is very different in the USA. Generally, you will find it difficult to solve consumer problems outside the EU so it's not a good idea to buy computer equipment from traders based on the other side of the globe.",0
"During a hometown football game on Friday night, more than a dozen members of Ames High School Marching Bandlinked arms and walked off the field before a performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Meanwhile, other band members refused to play their instruments, citing racial injustice and a number of other excuses, while blaming President Donald Trump for their sick act. However, while the students may have been proud of themselves during the disrespectful protest, spectators were definitely not amused and decided to teach the ungrateful little brats a brutal lesson which they sorely needed to learn.
According to local media, after a group of students from the marching band atAmes High School in Iowa decided to protest the national anthem in the vain of professional athletes like Colin Kaepernick, spectators gave them a piece of their mind.
More than a dozen members of the Ames High School marching band Friday became the latest Iowa students to make a statement surroundingthe playing of the national anthem.
Thirteen band members linked arms and walked off the field duringa performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” prior to the Little Cyclones’ home football game against Des Moines Lincoln.
Additionally, an unknown number of band members decided not to play their instruments during the anthem. [Source: The Des Moines Register]
Spectators in the stands, however, were not happy that their hometown football game was hijacked by a group of budding social justice warriors. The onlookers immediately began loudly cursing at the students as they walked off the field, letting them know that their disrespectful display would not be tolerated.
“How can we be unified if there’s racism, sexism, and homophobia in our school?” said sophomore Lara Murray, one of the students who walked off the field ahead of Friday’s game. “I had a lot of second thoughts on it, but I thought I was going to regret it more if I didn’t do something.”
“We wanted to make this a movement, not a trend,” echoed band member Petr Karpov, according to The Gateway Pundit. “It was for taking a stand against racial prejudice.”
“It was an expression of my anger and sadness in the direction our country is heading,” added a student named Kira Davis, who also joined the protest. “It’s to express I stand with people who are feeling persecuted or marginalized by the current president or people in power.”
As a parent, you hope that by involving your children in extracurricular activities, they will foster values like hard work, integrity, and respect. However, it seems that in our increasingly liberal society, the adults in charge of educating our children are less and less likely to encourage adolescents to do the right thing.
The leader of the Ames High School Marching Band should have never allowed these students to protest our national anthem, and anyone who decided to do so anyway should have been punished. Sadly, that isn’t what happened.
While spectators at the football game cursed the disrespectful students who walked out before the anthem was played, their teachers did little to deter them from future protests. When the next generation comes of age without basic life skills, it will be these liberal educators whom we have to thank.",1

When I took a doTERRA Essential Oils class in 2015, I learned that Lavender Oil can heal minor burns. I purchased the doTERRA Family Essentials Kit, but I didn’t know if there was any value to Essential Oils. While I was skeptical, I was also intrigued. So, I subconsciously arranged a way to test the knowledge!
Although I had never burned myself before, a few days after the class, I burned my wrist when I reached into the oven! I immediately thought of the Lavender Oil and decided to test it. I guessed it might help, but wasn’t expecting much. So, I was stunned to witness that as I rubbed a drop of Lavender Essential Oil over the burn, the pain INSTANTLY disappeared – completely. Without the Lavender, the burn would have remained very painful, blistered, and may have gotten infected, and /or left a scar. Lavender immediately solved the problem and returned my skin to normal.
A few weeks later, I again burned myself in the oven! Lavender Oil performed just as miraculously the second time! I became a true believer in Lavender and wanted to know more about Essential Oils!
7 Essential Oils for Second Degree Burns & How to Use points out:
“You can use essential oils for second degree burns that are small to help heal them faster without any infection or scarring. This article will show you which oils are the best and how to use them to make safe and effective DIY burn treatments! Did you know that the knowledge of essential oils was forgotten for a long time and only recently rediscovered by accident when a chemist got his hand burned?! Yup, you read that right! When French chemist, Rene Maurice Gattefosse was working in his lab one day in the early 1900’s, he suffered a severe burn. Immediately, he immersed his hand in a nearby vessel containing none other than…lavender oil! Gattefosse found that over the course of a few days, his hand not only felt much better but also didn’t scar and healed faster. This is how he started researching more on aromatherapy and essential oils and brought the long-lost knowledge out to the open again.”
The article explains how Lavender and other Essential Oils help heal burns:
Essential oils help treat second degree burns in the following ways:
* Speeding up the rate at which the burn heals
Small second degree burns can be treated at home, but if you have a large burn, then please seek professional medical help.
Top 15 Powerful Essential Oils for Burns describes first, second, third, and fourth degree burns and cautions:
Note: If you have severe burns, you must see a doctor immediately to receive the best treatment and care. Natural remedies such as essential oils are only to be used as first aid and treatment for minor burns. Essential oils may also be used alongside conventional treatment for medium burns.
Best Essential Oils For Sunburn | 7 NaturalRemedies points out:
Essential oils are excellent for sunburn as they help to heal and soothe the burns. The natural healing properties of organic oils heal the wounds and burns on skin very quickly. Also, these oils make the skin soft, smoother, moisturized and beautiful. No wonder, why do most natural skin care products have a range of essential oils as ingredients in them. According to a phototherapy research report, essential oils like lavender oil contains antibacterial, antifungal, carminative, and sedative properties effective for burns, skin diseases, wounds, and insect bites.
The instructor of the Essential Oils class I attended explained why she relies exclusively on essential oils from doTerra. She recommended buying them directly from the doTerra site rather than on Amazon to insure purity. I later did my own research and came to agree that doTerra offers the best quality oils.
The doTerra site explains: “Founded in 2008, doTERRA was built on the mission of sharing therapeutic-grade essential oils with the world. Having seen for themselves the incredible benefits that can be had from using these precious resources, a group of health-care and business professionals set out to make this mission a reality. They formed a company and named it doTERRA, a Latin derivative meaning “Gift of the Earth.”
The first hurdle to overcome, however, was to establish a standard of quality in an industry that had never had one. It wasn’t enough to simply provide essential oils to homes around the world; the doTERRA founders were committed to providing only the highest quality and purest essential oils so that families could know with surety that they were using only the best to promote health and wellness for their loved ones. This commitment lead to the creation of a new standard of therapeutic quality: CPTG Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade.”
doTERRA sells Essential Oils retail at: https://www.doterra.com/US/en. If you set up an account, you can buy at wholesale prices. Single oils and kits are available. I started with the Family Essentials Kit and Beadletswhich contains 10 Essential Oils of 5ml each which was a good way to become acquainted with popular Essential Oils. Through my monthly account with doTerra, I add other oils to my collection as I learn more. Lavender Oil is available in a 15mil bottle and as Lavender Touch (a roll-on) which is easy to keep in your bag and is convenient for travel.
Essential Oils can be applied topically or diffused. Amazon has a wide selection of diffusers which turn off when they run out of water to prevent fires. Amazon also has an assortment of personal diffusers like the Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser Necklace shown below. Amazon also has an Essential Oil Diffuser Bracelet and other bracelets.
My article Rosemary Protects Against Radiation! explains that Rosemary Oil can be applied to the soles of the feet to help protect against radiation from a growing number of sources including cell phones, cell towers, and the Fukushima site. The radiation threat also includes the rollout of the 5G technology that is causing a great deal of alarm. Note: Rosemary Oil is contra-indicated for anyone who is subject to seizures, as shown further below.
Some Essential Oils can be taken internally. However, that should be done with great caution. doTerra has Peppermint Beadlets that are great breath fresheners and OnGuard beadlets for protection.
There are many books on Essential Oils. The following two are especially helpful:
1 –The Essential Life, 4th Edition: This 2017 book has six sections that make it easy to find information. Section 1 is an introduction. Section 2 is a Quick Reference that lists ailments from A-Z and recommends 5 Essential Oils for each. Section 3 “Natural Solutions” describes how to use single oils, oil blends, and supplementary products. Section 4 focuses on the use of oils for various parts of the body. Section 5 provides recipes. Section 6 is a supplement.
Note: This book does not provide warnings when an Essential Oil is contra-indicated for various conditions. Contra-indications are often not mentioned online either. For that reason, it is important to have the second book below.
2 –Essential Oils Natural Remedies: The Complete A-Z Reference of Essential Oils for Health and Healing: This 2015 book is a must-have because it is the only one I’ve found so far that provides cautions when there are restrictions on how an oil should be used. For example, it warns that while Rosemary Oil aids memory, it should not be used by anyone who is subject to seizures. It provides the same warning for Peppermint Oil which is good for energy.
Note: Do not use or recommend any essential oil without first checking this book to see if there are any contra-indications! Essential Oils can be very powerful and fast-acting. Take the time to become fully informed so you can use and recommend the oils safely and effectively.
Dr. Josh Axe and Jordan Rubin are co-authors (along with Ty Bollinger) of the 500-page 2017 book Essential Oils: Ancient Medicine. The Amazon Description says: “In a world where medicine cabinets are packed full of prescription medications and synthetic drugs—with lists of dangerous side effects longer than benefits—it’s time to discover a superior alternative with thousands of years of historical backing and current scientific review.“
Dr. Axe’s free 30-page ebook The King’s Medicine Cabinet is an Essential Oils Daily Use Guide.
In the 35-minute video below, Dr. Axe and Jordan discuss the use of Essential Oils for various conditions. The video links to Dr. Axe’s Essential Oils Beginners Guide which provides an index to information about the oils. Dr. Axe has been featured on The Dr. Oz Show, CBS, NBC and hosts his own PBS Special focusing on digestive wellness. Jordan has degrees in naturopathic medicine, nutrition, and natural therapies. He has written several books and has appeared on more than 300 TV and radio programs worldwide
“Essential oils are organic compounds extracted from plants with tremendous healing properties. Using essential oils for healing purposes is often called aromatherapy. For over 5,000 years, many different cultures have used these healing plant oils for a variety of health conditions. They are often used for relaxation, beauty care, home cleaning, and most often used as natural medicine.
Jordan Rubin and I discuss several essential oils — including frankincense, turmeric, lavender, oregano, clove, tea tree, ylang ylang, and so many more — and how to use each one to help combat common illnesses. Watch to learn the power of essential oils as medicine.”
In the very informative 1-hour video below, Casey Robertson gives a testimonial on the use of the oils and supplements for knee pain. He discusses single oils and blends. The video explains that doTERRA provides a marketing opportunity.
The WorldWideOils site discusses Casey’s experience and that of his wife in marketing doTerra. It points out: “Now, just 7short years later, their doTERRA business (Worldwide Oils) is producing well over $1 million in sales per month in over 35 countries, with over 30 thousand customers and hundreds of people who are now earning part-time, full-time, and even multiple 6-figure incomes on the Worldwide Oils Team.”

"Many small businesses involve food. The baker, the butcher, the coffeecake makerand the farmer-in-the-dell are all likely to be small businesses.
But as small businesses, most of these food-related companies have the same problem: how dotheir owners get the cash they need to buy supplies before they actually make sales?
Now, there’s a new app that helps food-related small businesses improve their cash flow and nurture  customers at the same time, “Credibles.” The San Francisco-based start-up aims to help small food businesses by  letting customers  pre-pay   from a growing number of small food companies, essentially setting up a prepaid tab. The  businesses then have that money to use without having to take out loans.
“It’s easier to put money into Monsanto and McDonald’s than invest in the bakery down the street,” said Credibles’ founder Arno Hesse.
That’s because you can buy stock in large food companies. But how doavid fans help insure the survival of their favorite coffee shop or cheese maker? With Credibles, they  exchange their money for food, not shares.
If customers prepay larger amounts through the app — typically over $100 — they’ll usually earn extra “edible credits,” perhaps an additional 10%worth of food. Then, with their account preloaded with cash, the customer uses their “edible credits”  to make purchases at the local café, or of the food product.
From a small business point of view, this is a potential godsend. An independent, local coffee shop can now have the capability of a Starbucks-like pre-pay app, without having to hire expensive software developers to build and maintain it.
The small food producer or vendor wins: The prepayments can let them make raw material purchases before they make sales, without having to pay interest (except in the form of some extra products).
Money now is worth a lot more than money later. With money up front and cash in the bank, small businesses can hire employees. They can expand their operations.
And customers win: They get a discount while making it more likely their favoritecompanies will stay in business.
Hesse says people often ask why customers would part with their money in advance. Three reasons:
1. A sense of belonging and connection to community.
2. The incentives of the additional credits.
3. Convenience of not having to carry cash or a credit card.
Credibles  has local providers in over a dozen states,  primarily in the Bay Area and New York. The company welcomes suggestions of your favorite small food company, which they will then contact to be added.
Every small business dreams of payment in advance, and for good reason.
Look at Starbucks: In the first quarter of 2016 alone, itscustomers had loaded their prepaid cards to the tune of $1.2 billion— more money than some smaller regional U. S. banks have on deposit.  Thatmountain of money gives Starbucks immense buying power.
Credibles is a step — though a small step right now — in helping to even the playing field for small businesses.

"The news that a Russian crime ring has stolen some 1.2 billion username and password combinations makes it more important than ever to take steps to protect yourself online.
Hold Security, which uncovered the data breach, called it ""the largest known collection of stolen Internet credentials"" ever amassed. The firm did not publicly identify the websites that had been compromised. But with that many usernames and passwords in the hands of hackers, no one can assume their online accounts are safe.
Experts say there are a number of things consumers can do. Top of the list: ""Change all passwords immediately,"" advised Adam Levin, chairman of identity theft protection and remediation firm IDT911.
And don't just swap one weak password for another. Changing ""123456"" (the most common password of 2013, according to SplashData) to ""password"" (the second most common) simply won't do the job.
There are more tips for better passwords below. But even if you follow all the recommended security practices, passwords can still be vulnerable.
""Creating a password, no matter how tricky and complex you think it is, is not something you can rely on to stop a very devoted hacker from getting to your data,"" warns Connie Guglielmo, editor-in-chief of CNET News.
Fortunately, there are some alternatives. A password manager such as LastPass or the 1Password app can help eliminate the chore of keeping track of a long list of complex (and easily forgettable) passwords.
""You log into the password manager, and then it auto-generates and creates and manages all the passwords for you,"" Guglielmo explains.
CNET's Sumi Das reports some tech companies are hard at work developing systems that could replace passwords completely using biometric technology.
Fingerprint scanners are already in use to unlock phones like the iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy S5. A phone's camera could someday be used as a retinal scanner. And a Toronto-based firm called Bionym is developing a device that would use your heartbeat to unlock everything from your car to your computer.
But until that futuristic technology arrives, experts offer these 7 tips for stronger passwords today:
* Make your password long. The recommended minimum is eight characters, but 14 is better and 25 is even better than that. Some services have character limits on passwords, though.
* Use combinations of letters and numbers, upper and lower case and symbols such as the exclamation mark, if the site allows. ""PaSsWoRd!43"" is far better than ""password43"" -- although increasingly sophisticated hackers may still be able to crack it.
* Substitute characters. For instance, use the number zero instead of the letter O, or replace the S with a dollar sign.
* Avoid words that are in dictionaries; there are programs that can crack passwords by going through databases of known words. One trick is to add numbers in the middle of a word -- as in ""pas123swor456d"" instead of ""password123456."" Another is to think of a sentence or phrase and use just the first letter of each word -- as in ""tqbfjotld"" for ""the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
* Avoid easy-to-guess words, even if they aren't in the dictionary. Don't use your name, company name, hometown, or pets' or relatives' names. Likewise, avoid things that can be looked up, such as your birthday or ZIP code.
* Never reuse passwords on multiple accounts -- with two exceptions. If the password is for one-time use, such as when a newspaper website requires you to register to read the full story, it's okay to reuse simple passwords. Just make sure the password isn't unlocking features that involve credit cards or posting on a message board. The other exception is to log in using a centralized sign-on service such as Facebook Connect. Hulu, for instance, gives you the option of using your Facebook username and password instead of creating a separate one for the video site. This technically isn't reusing your password, but a matter of Hulu borrowing the log-in system Facebook already has in place. The account information isn't stored with Hulu. Facebook merely tells Hulu's computers that it's you. Of course, if you do this, it's even more important to keep your Facebook password secure.
* Use two-step verification. Some services such as Gmail offer this option, in which the service sends a text message with a six-digit code to your phone when you try to log in from an unrecognized device. You'll need to enter the code for access before it expires. Hackers won't be able to access the account if they don't have your phone. Turn on this feature in Gmail by going to the account's security settings.",0
"Nine sailors from a nuclear missile submarine have been dismissed from the Royal Navy after failing drugs tests, the Ministry of Defence has said.
They had been serving aboard HMS Vigilant, which carries the Trident nuclear deterrent.
The Daily Mail reported that the drug they had taken was cocaine.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is understood to have ordered all UK submarine crews to be tested for drugs.
He is said to have given First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones a ""roasting"" over the incident.
The Royal Navy said it did not tolerate drugs misuse, adding: ""Those found to have fallen short of our high standards face being discharged from service.""
Earlier this month, the submarine's captain was relieved of his command after an alleged ""inappropriate relationship"" with a member of his crew.
The Royal Navy said at the time that an investigation was ongoing and operations were not impacted.
The BBC's Jonathan Beale said Vigilant's second-in-command had also been removed over similar allegations.
HMS Vigilant is one of Britain's four Vanguard-class submarines which carry up to eight Trident missiles armed with nuclear warheads.
The submarine is based at Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde at Faslane in Argyll and Bute.
All Royal Navy vessels have a ""no touching rule"" that prohibits intimate relationships on board.",0
"The Hays Consolidated Independent School District Facebook page removed a post about a planned bioterrorism drill afterprotest of the use of mass vaccination followed its two posts.
The vaccination debate unexpectedly came to the Hays CISD Facebook page on Monday following two posts about a planned “emergency response and mass vaccination drill” at Hays High School.
The bioterrorism drill, from 7:30 a.m. until noon on Tuesday, took place in the high school parking lot, involving area first responders and volunteers. Hays County says they hold this kind of drill to practice the emergency distribution of relief items, vaccinations and medication and health assessments.
“This particular scenario was based upon an anthrax release in the county,” said Hays County Emergency Preparedness Coordinator Mike Jones. “We take that as a terrorist event or bioterrorism.”
CISD explained that students were not a part of the drill and they didn’t intend vaccination to be the focus.
“We want emergency medicine, we want to be able to get water and food when we need it if there is a crisis, but a mass vaccination drill — it’s not real!” said Donna Voetee who spoke out about the event. “A mass vaccination drill promoted by our government, its tyranny and it’s terrifying to me that this would happen.”
She traveledfrom Lockhart to Kyle to watch but says the actual event was downplayed including the use of mass vaccination, perhaps because of cyber warriors.
It was the follow-up post that the district removed shortly after.
“…the district wanted to highlight that campus operations would not be affected and no actual vaccines or medicine would be used in the drill. Instead, volunteers received candy,” KXAN reports. Candy….
“The government is not here to take care of them; we’re here to provide some resources and get them some direction,” said Jones.During the Memorial Day Flood, the countydistributed clean up kits, during the Bastrop Fires, bottled water was distributed.“You can’t always prevent a flood, but you can prepare to approach that flood with better processes and better preparations,” he says.
The government isn’t here to take care of them, but will vaccinate everyone after they have been exposed to anthrax? It sounds like they need some drills for their staff to fix their convolution before communicating to the public because it sounds like people aren’t buying it.
Vaccination has always been propagandized as a preventative, now it’s an emergency supply?
Whether “emergency” supplies are distributed in an event doesn’t depend on the number of people, just “on the subject of the emergency like whether it’s a flood, fire or health problem. It also depends on the community’s needs like if they need water or vaccinations.”
The government isn’t here to take care of you, but you may need vaccinations. Hmmm…
We would just like to remind everyone that there has never been a “debate” about vaccination. A debate is when two sides have equally opposite views of logic to offer. The issue has always been about medical rights and those who want to erase them. You can’t have a debate that coerces yourself out of your own rights. (Please read  to see animals get “debated” out of their rights – a great lesson.) There is no debate – the goal is for Big Pharma to force injectable drugs on a rightfully concerned public.
While hosting a bioterrorism drill using literal terror to push vaccines should spark a massive protest, it appears that it merely embroiled people in a “debate.” Or perhaps, the massive outcry on social media taught CISD that the public is not ready to be trained into submitting to this type of drug pushing just yet.
If anything it should cause us to ponder the irony of the word bioterrorism.

"If you have a dog, fleas are probably your worst nightmare. Commercial flea treatments are loaded with dangerous chemicals which may cause various adverse effects.
Actually, these products are the second most common cause of poisoning in dogs and can cause various adverse effects, including skin irritations, seizures, and even death.
Consequently, dog owners have started to search natural solutions to the problem of fleas. The following recipe is one of the favorite ones of holistic vets, as it provides amazing effects:
Ingredients:
1 cup of food grade diatomaceous earth
1/2 cup of yarrow powder
1/2 cup of Neem powder
20 drops of eucalyptus essential oil
Instructions:
You should mix all ingredients and store the mixture in a container with a shaker top.
Use:
You should apply the powder to the fur of your dog while dry, and brush it in order to help it come into contact with the skin. Yet, make sure you avoid the areas of the nose and eyes.
You should apply the powder every other day in case of an active flea infestation until you completely remove fleas. You should also apply powder on places where your dog spends most of its time, like its bed or carpet. Leave the powder to act for a few hours, and then vacuum it up.
You should also apply this powder one a month during flea season, to avoid such issues.
The efficacy of this powder is due to the properties of its ingredients.
Diatomaceous Earth
It is made up of the silica from fossilized aquatic organisms, and the silica grains are harmful to insects but harmless to you and your pet. As soon as insects come to contact with it, it dehydrates their skin and punctures them.
Yarrow Powder
The bites of fleas can easily become infected and thus cause even bigger issues. As an anti-inflammatory substance, yarrow powder prevents these issues and soothes irritations.
Neem Powder
It has long been used to repel ticks, lice, fleas, and other pests. It has azadirachtin, which prevents the development of insect larvae, and thus inhibiting new generations.
Neem powder also contains salannin, which has been proven to provide great effects in repelling pests, even better than DEET.
Eucalyptus Essential Oil
The effectiveness of this oil has been confirmed by the CDC, and experts have shown that it is as successful as chemical DEET. Furthermore, this oil has potent antiseptic properties which will accelerate hеaling after the bites.
The following video will provide additional information on natural flea remedies, so you should watch it carefully!

"McDonalds are improving their latest menu by phasing out the use of chicken that has been raised with antibiotics.
Could this have anything to do with a decline in sales or have they decided that they really care about what we eat…suddenly!
The following article seems to sum it up pretty well.
Collective Evolution write: As one of the biggest and most widely recognized fast food chains in the world, it should come as no surprise to see McDonald’s regularly featured in the media. Just over a week after it was reported that vinyl plastic was found in their infamous Chicken McNuggets in Japan, spurring a major recall, McDonald’s has made news once again involving the popular chicken snack.
McDonald’s announced that they will be phasing out the use of chicken meat from chickens raised with antibiotics that are important to human medicine.
On the surface, this certainly is a step in the right direction, as the use of antibiotics on animals (especially for growth promotion) is widely frowned upon, and many other restaurants, including Chipotle and A&W, have fully eliminated it from their menus as a result. But I personally think this announcement sets a new precedent for how little a baby step in the right direction can be.
The qualifier to their statement, “important to human medicine,” is pretty depressing when it comes to realizing how little of a change this actually is. Rather than eliminating the use of all antibiotics, they have instead opted to only account for those that are considered similar to ones regularly used in human medicine. This means that a number of antibiotics that do not fall under this bracket will continue to be acceptable based on McDonald’s standards – including many which are injected solely for meat growth promotion.
McDonald’s has faced a substantial amount of scrutiny over the years, with their McNuggets in particular often being the centrepiece – due in large part to the infamous picture featuring a mysterious pink substance that many have linked to their McNuggets. In an attempt to combat this, the company recently launched an advertising campaign focused upon transparency, where several consumer questions and concerns were publicly answered and made available.
Both this campaign and now the announcement certainly support the potentiality that the company is engaged in a form of damage control. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the company has posted a decrease in sales for the 9th straight month. The question is whether or not the fast food mega-giant actually cares for our health or if they are simply doing these initiatives in an attempt to re-drive us towards the golden arches?
Even though the change is a minuscule step in the right direction, it still is a step and I commend McDonald’s for taking it. However, as a restaurant with over 35,000 global locations, I certainly hope this effort is followed up with some more substantial progress, which it seems is being rightfully (albeit slowly) demanded by the public – who seem to be consuming it less and less.
What are your thoughts on the changes made by McDonald’s? Do you think that they actually care for our well-being? Or are these campaigns and announcements solely to give us the illusion of concern? Let us know via the comment section below.",1
"A second undercover video shows a Planned Parenthood (PPFA) executive haggling over payments for fetal specimens with a potential buyer, offering a “less crunchy technique” to keep more of the body parts fully intact.
After last weeks shocking video where a differentPPFA executive admitted to selling aborted foetuses for $30-$100 per specimen, thislatestvideo confirms the horrificmedical malpracticesPPFA practise.
According to the video’s description:
Gatter is a senior official within Planned Parenthood and is President of the Medical Directors’ Council, the central committee of all Planned Parenthood affiliate medical directors.
Actors posing as buyers ask Gatter, “What would you expect for intact [fetal] tissue?”
“Well, why don’t you start by telling me what you’re used to paying!” Gatter replies.
Gatter continues: “You know, in negotiations whoever throws out the figure first is at a loss, right?” She explains, “I just don’t want to lowball,” before suggesting, “$75 a specimen.”
Gatter twice recites Planned Parenthood messaging on fetal tissue collection, “We’re not in it for the money,” and “The money is not the important thing,” but she immediately qualifies each statement with, respectively, “But what were you thinking of?” and, “But it has to be big enough that it’s worthwhile for me.”
Gatter also admits that in prior fetal tissue deals, Planned Parenthood received payment in spite of incurring no cost: “It was logistically very easy for us, we didn’t have to do anything. So there was compensation for this.” She accepts a higher price of $100 per specimen understanding that it will be only for high-quality fetal organs: “Now, this is for tissue that you actually take, not just tissue that someone volunteers and you can’t find anything, right?”
By the lunch’s end, Gatter suggests $100 per specimen is not enough and concludes, “Let me just figure out what others are getting, and if this is in the ballpark, then it’s fine, if it’s still low, then we can bump it up. I want a Lamborghini.”
The sale or purchase of human fetal tissue is a federal felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to $500,000 (42 U. S.C. 289g-2).
Gatter also suggests modifying the abortion procedure to get more intact fetuses: “I wouldn’t object to asking Ian, who’s our surgeon who does the cases, to use an IPAS [manual vacuum aspirator] at that gestational age in order to increase the odds that he’s going to get an intact specimen.”
Gatter seems aware this violates rules governing tissue collection, but disregards them: “To me, that’s kind of a specious little argument.” Federal law requires that no alteration in the timing or method of abortion be done for the purposes of fetal tissue collection (42 U. S.C. 289g-1).
The video, like last week’s featuring Dr. Nucatola, was produced by The Center for Medical Progress and is part of CMP’s nearly 3-year-long investigative journalism study, “Human Capital.”
CMP’s Project Lead David Daleiden notes, “Planned Parenthood’s top leadership admits they harvest aborted baby parts and receive payments for this. Planned Parenthood’s only denial is that they make money off of baby parts, but that is a desperate lie that becomes more and more untenable as CMP reveals Planned Parenthood’s business operations and statements that prove otherwise.”
Seven State Governments have opened investigations into Planned Parenthood’s sale of aborted fetal body parts, as have three Congressional Committees. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has called PPFA’s Senior Director of Medical Services to testify this month about the organization’s fetal tissue harvesting.",1
"Bleaching can have damaging effects on hair but these are preventable if you add moisture to ensure a shiny and healthy appearance. Dedication and consistency are necessary for effectively preventing your hair from breaking and drying out.
Shampoos are formulated to keep hair clean by removing oil, dirt and grime but excessive washing can strip your hair of its natural oils. Within the initial weeks you can wash your hair a few times each week or as often as your stylist recommends. Use gentle cleansing products on your roots in between shampooing and washes.
Consider applying a quality hair mask at least once each week and gently combing through it for equal distribution of the product. Follow the directions regarding how long you should leave the mask on your hair. Focus on finding a mask that is specially designed for dry, damaged or color treated hair. Deep conditioning treatments are also recommended for moisturizing your hair.
Use microfiber towels to dry your hair after washing rather than blow drying that subjects your hair to a lot of heat. These types of towels will also help to combat the frizzing that often occurs with bleached hair. When you dry your hair, avoid rubbing it vigorously and gently squeeze and pat the hair until it dries.
Bleaching can make hair brittle and you need to brush or comb it gently when you want to style it. Wide tooth combs and soft bristle brushes can be used. Begin from the ends and gradually move up to the roots of your hair.
One of the essential things that you can do to restore the softness of your hair is conditioning. Leave-in conditioners are worthwhile additions to hair care routines. Find products that will replenish the natural oils that are stripped away during the process of bleaching.
* Avoid styling tools such as curling irons that expose bleached hair to a lot of heat. If you use these types of tools, invest in hair products that can provide protection from the damage that high temperatures may cause.
* Products include creams, mists and sprays, depending on what works for your hair, how you style it and affordability. Identify the product that will nourish your bleached hair and moisturizes it as well.
* Limit frequent and direct exposure to the sun that can further dry your hair and strip its color.
* A good hair oil or serum will help to replace the oil that is diminished when you bleach your hair. Use the oil sparingly to keep it shiny and soft.
* Treat yourself to hair salon treatment for a deep moisture treatment that will minimize frizz and enhance softness.
Bleaching your hair often leads to split ends. When spit ends are not dealt with, they can split the entire hair shaft and create a straw-like appearance. Trim your hair as often as recommended, which is usually every month or 6 weeks.
Touch up the roots of your hair regularly to deal with how the bleach develops along the hair that is close to your scalp. This will also ensure that your hair color is even. Minimize damage by bleaching the newly grown darker hair instead of bleaching all your hair.
Keeping your skin clean will prevent it from becoming clogged and susceptible to breakouts. Take proper care of your skin by using a cleanser that is suitable for your skin type. Daily use is necessary for consistency and results. Adopt the habit of regularly washing your face each morning and night.
Exfoliate your skin on a weekly basis to remove dead skin cells that ca make your skin look uneven and dull. Use the right product to keep your skin fresh and vibrant. Exfoliate gently by using circular motions and applying light pressure on your skin.
* Avoid excessive contact with your face, pulling your skin and trying to pop simples.
* Touching your face excessively as the day goes on can be damaging when you clog your pores with dirt and create wrinkles or fine lines.
* Wear sunscreen on a daily basis to ensure that your skin in adequately protected from irreversible damage that can be caused by exposure to the harmful UV rays of the sun.
Regardless of the type of skin you have, you need a good moisturizer that will nourish and hydrate it. Choose products that consist of natural ingredients and use hydrating lotions as soon as you get out of the bath or shower for better absorption. Moisturizer is crucial for replenishing your skin everyday.",1

Itchy skin is one symptom of eczema, an inflammation of the skin that is relatively common. More than 20% of people with skin disease have some degree of eczema. Doctors often prescribe cortisone creams and ointments that sometimes don’t work and often have undesired side effects. If you’re running into this problem, here are a few alternative methods to deal with eczema using more natural means.
1. Oatmeal
Oats aren’t just the tastiest breakfast, they are also great for battling eczema. Here is how to take a oatmeal bath: Fill up a sock with oats and hang it from the bath faucet before filling it up. The water should flow through the sock, releasing the soothing qualities of the oats. You could alternatively use nettles, which have pain-, inflammation-, and itch-reducing effects.
2. Cucumber
Cucumbers have an extremely high moisture content and thus are great for preventing inflammation. Placing a few cucumbers on itchy skin can help relieve the itch substantially.
3. Aloe Vera
Aloe Vera is another natural way to heal eczema and reduce dryness and itchiness. You can simply buy a few aloe vera leaves and squeeze the gel out of them. Rub the liquid into your skin for relief. If you store the leaves in the refrigerator, they should be good for multiple applications.
4. Lemon
Press a lemon wedge onto your inflamed skin. It may burn at first, but the lemon juice will also help to reduce your inflammation.
5. Turmeric
Turmeric is both disinfecting and anti-inflammatory. It’s not only used for cases of eczema, but many other skin illness as well. Mix turmeric powder with water and spread the paste directly on your skin. Let it sit for a few hours and then rinse it off. Warning: This is called “yellow root” for a reason; it can leave lasting stains on fabric and surfaces.
6. Humidifier
Dry air is not good for your skin, especially when you’re dealing with eczema. It may be wise to invest in a humidifier if the air in your home is especially dry. If you can’t afford one, placing a few extra plants in the room can also increase the moisture in the air.
7. Relaxation
Stress doesn’t just affect you psychologically, it is also extremely unhealthy for your body. Eczema and many other illnesses can worsen with high stress levels. Make sure you give yourself enough time to step back from your day-to-day worries and relax. Exercise, cooking with friends, or reading are all great ways to calm your nerves.
8. Use natural cosmetics and lotions
Natural cosmetics and creams don’t usually containing sodium lauryl sulfates and parabens. Both of these chemicals are often found in laundry detergent, shampoo, dish soap, and cosmetics. Parabens aren’t just connected with skin inflammation, they have also been linked to hormonal and fertility issues as well as cancer.
9. Honey
Honey is not just delicious, but it can also help prevent irritation and eczema. Spread honey on you skin and let it sit for 20 to 30 minutes. Rinse with cool water and them pat your skin dry with a cotton pad.
10. Camomile compress
Camomile is soothing for your skin and prevents infection. To make a compress, boil dried camomile in water for 15 minutes and then pour the liquid through a sieve, saving the water. Let it cool and then soak a towel with the tea. Place the warm towel on your skin for 15 minutes.
11. Coconut oil
Cold-pressed coconut oil is an ideal alternative to lotion and a great way to combat eczema. Almond oil also works to soothe itchy and dry skin. Simply rub it in and you’re done!
12. Healthy nutrition
Try to avoid foods with artificial additives and saturated fats. Fast food and candy don’t only make you pack on the pounds, they also damages your skin and can cause eczema. Eat as many fruits and vegetables as you can as well as legumes. Increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids is especially beneficial. Those can be found in leafy greens and fish. Gluten, milk, milk products, soy, nuts, and even eggs are all thought to trigger eczema outbreaks. It may be helpful to avoid those foods for a while and see if your skin improves.
Of course, every body is unique and the cause and solution is different for each person’s skin. It takes a lot of time and energy to try all of these various tips to see what works for your skin. But it’s worth it because once you know what is causing the irritation and what can help it, you can make better decisions every day.

"Baking soda is one of those multi-purpose items that’s found in every household. It’s used as a leavening agent in baking, as a tooth-whitening agent, as a deodorizer in the fridge or laundry and even in the garden.
That’s right – baking soda is useful in the garden in more than one way. And forget about using it only in your garden, since you can also grow food indoors!
Each year, almost 140 million pounds of pesticide are applied to lawns and gardens, both commercial and private. That’s a whole lot of poison going into our ground and thus our ground water. Not to mention the fact that you’re eating it, too.
But what’s the solution? Make your own! I’ve been experimenting with natural pesticides over the last year and I’ve learned a lot. Right off the bat, I had a problem with aphids on my peppers and tomatoes. So, I did what all good farmers do – I headed to Google.
The first recommendation was Neem oil, which is apparently good for many things in the garden, but I didn’t have any Neem oil, so I kept looking. Then I came across a recipe that used baking soda, dish soap, olive oil, and water. I mixed it up, sprayed it on my plants every other day for a week, and BAM! Problem solved.
I sprayed them once a week just for maintenance, and supposedly it’s good for spider mites, too. I read that it’s good to get rid of fungus, but I didn’t have that problem. Of course, that may have been because I was using the solution.
Ant problems? Baking soda is good for that, too. Mix it with confectionary sugar and vinegar. You can’t use regular sugar because ants are smart enough to separate regular granulated sugar and the baking soda, so it won’t hurt them. Not so with the confectionary sugar.
Use equal parts and add enough water to make it damp an sprinkle where the ants are a problem. Ants will eat the sugar, and take in the baking soda, which is lethal to them. Afterward, spray the nest with vinegar to kill the remainder.
If your plants have hit a funk and just aren’t growing well, producing, or looking as bright and beautiful as you’d like them to, give them a boost with a gallon of water, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon Epsom salts, and 1/2 teaspoon ammonia. Give each plant a quart or so and do this once a month.
You’ll be amazed how happy they’ll look almost immediately.
If you have baking soda and vinegar, you can find the approximate pH of your soil, which is important to know because different plants grow best in different acidities. This won’t give you the exact pH, but it will tell you whether your soil is acidic, neutral, or base. Start by collecting two soil samples from different parts of your garden.
Separate each sample into two different containers so that you have two test containers for each location sample. Add 1/4-1/2 cup of vinegar to one test container for each location. If it bubbles, your soil is alkaline, which means that your soil pH is above 7.
If it doesn’t bubble, then mix equal parts water and baking soda and add it to the other two samples. If it bubbles, then your soil is acidic; your pH is lower than 7. If you get nothing, it’s base, or 7.
So say you did the pH test above and your soil is acidic, but you want to grow plants such as hydrangeas or begonias, or carrots, cucumbers, or cauliflower. They grow best in alkaline soil. Well lucky for you, you have a big box of baking soda in your garden shed. Mix it in with the soil or make a solution with water and spray/pour it on to make your soil more plant-friendly.
Everybody knows that salt kills slugs, but salt is also not so great for your plants. Baking soda, on the other hand, is not bad for your plants, but it does kill slugs.
You can put it right on the slug and you can also sprinkle it lightly on the soil to deter them.
Be careful not to get the powder on the plants though because it will burn them.
These will decimate your leafy greens and are hard to get rid of, unless you have baking soda, of course. Remember though that straight baking soda will burn your plants, so mix it with equal parts flour and dust your plants with it. They’ll die within a day of ingestion. Repeat two or three times to get rid of them.
Baking soda is great in the fridge and to deodorize laundry, so there’s no reason to think it won’t do the same for your compost pile.
It will also help prevent acid buildup. Use it sparingly though because it’ll slow down the composting process.
Baking soda kills mold and mildew spores, which is wonderful in numerous garden applications. It’s good for your plants, but also for patio furniture, decks, and anywhere else that’s damp and prone to these spores.
Add a tablespoon of baking soda to two quarts of water and you’ll have a great solution to put your cut flowers in. Change the solution every couple of days.
Tomatoes grown in less acidic soil are much sweeter and may even grow bigger. No matter if they are planted in a pot or in your garden, sprinkle lightly onto the soil then water. It’s just like mixing it into the soil, without the work.
There are literally hundreds of uses for baking soda in the garden and in the house. It’s one of those multi-purpose items that everybody should have on hand. I’d venture to say that just about every house in America has at least one box, and those that don’t would probably tell you they were just out.
Another great thing about baking soda is that it’s dirt-cheap. I buy a box the size of a small cereal box at my local superstore for less than $2 and it lasts me quite a while because it takes so little to be effective. So if you need to make anything from toothpaste to pesticide, baking soda is a great tool to have and use to support your food independence!
If you can think of other uses for baking soda in the garden, please share them with us in the comments section below!

"Bearded irises are, undoubtedly, the tall standouts of the spring bulbs, with their showstopper flowers, complete with the ruffled edges that give them their name. If you’re looking for more variety, though, the iris family has plenty to offer. Beardless irises, such as Japanese irises, the native Louisiana and Pacific Coast irises, Siberian irises and spuria irises, are rapidly becoming more popular. Other choices include the familiar Dutch and Spanish irises, the English irises and the increasingly popular reticulata irises.
Fall is the standard planting time for irises, although some can also be planted in early spring. You should begin planting bearded irises in summer in the coldest-winter climates. You’ll be rewarded with blooms for years to come.
RELATED: Position Outdoor Benches Throughout Your Garden for Relaxing Views of Nature
Iris basics. The bulb type, growing conditions, watering needs and bloom times may vary, but the two things all irises have in common are their tall, narrow, upright to arching leaves and their flower structure. Their three inner petals are true petals, growing upright, arching or sometimes growing sideways. The outer segments of the bloom are not petals but sepals, also known as falls. On bearded and crested irises, these are ruffled or have a comb-like appearance.
Beyond that, the 250-plus species of iris can provide variety and continuous bloom in your garden. Choose from bearded or beardless irises, both of which grow from rhizomes, or opt for bulbous irises, which grow from true bulbs.
Irises are known for their flowers in shades of blue and purple, but you can find flowers in almost any color. With judicious choices, you can also plan for blooms throughout the spring and into summer.
Benefits and tolerances: As befits such a varied group of plants, irises can handle a range of growing conditions and different soils, although most insist on good drainage. They’re relatively deer-resistant, and many, especially the bearded irises, are drought-tolerant. They’re also fairly pest-free, with iris borer being the biggest concern.
Bloom season: Midspring, although remontant irises will rebloom in summer, fall or even winter
Where they will grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 10; find your zone)
Water requirements: Water regularly when plants are growing and blooming; cut back after bloom and through winter
When to plant: July to October; plant in July and August in the coldest-winter climates; plant in August to October in other climates, waiting until later in October in the warmest climates
Cautions: These rhizomes aren’t edible, and some people develop dermatitis from contact with them.
Bearded irises come in an astonishing array of sizes and colors. They are generally divided into four categories:
○ Tall bearded irises reach between 2 and 4 feet tall. They bloom in midspring, although some will also rebloom later in the year in the right conditions.
○ Median irises — border bearded irises, intermediate bearded irises and miniature tall bearded irises — are smaller, between 8 and 28 inches tall.
○ Dwarf types include the standard dwarf bearded irises, which flower on stems that are 8 to 15 inches tall, and miniature dwarf bearded irises, which reach only 2 to 8 inches tall.
○ The fourth category includes aril and arilbred irises. The Regelia group of aril irises and the arilbred irises, which are hybrids, need good drainage and alkaline soil; otherwise, their care is similar to bearded irises. The Oncocyclus group of aril irises is very particular about growing conditions, including soil, sun and summer water.
Planting notes. Choose a spot in full sun with good drainage. You may need to plant in raised beds or on hills if you have heavy clay soil. Set the rhizomes 1 foot to 3 feet apart just below the soil, with the leafy part pointed in the direction you want the plant to grow. Point the leafy part uphill if you’re planting on a slope.
Water thoroughly after planting. If the weather is hot, provide shade so the rhizomes won’t get scalded. If you have cold winters, cover the soil with mulch to protect the rhizomes.
Caring for bearded irises. Water sparingly after planting until the rhizomes set their roots. Then water regularly until it begins to rain or the ground freezes. Resume watering when growth begins, and water regularly throughout the growing and blooming season and an additional six weeks after blooms fade. Then water about once every couple of weeks if it’s warm to once a month if it’s cool. Shade the plants from afternoon sun in the hottest summer climates.
Feed with a neutral or low-nitrogen fertilizer when the plants begin to grow in spring and then again once they’ve finished blooming. Remove old or dead leaves in fall. If leaves show signs of leaf spot, apply a fungicide. Divide crowded clumps every three to four years.
Where they will grow: Varies by species
When to plant: Varies by species
Beardless irises lack the ruffled edges that characterize their bearded cousins, but that might be the only thing that binds them together. The hybrids are broken into five groups; a number of iris species are often included in the overall category as well.
Japanese iris. Sports broad flowers set on stems that can reach 4 feet tall. Colors include white, pink, blue and all shades of purple; flowers appear in late spring. Japanese irises like it to be wet; they are a good choice for along the edges of ponds or sunk into ponds. They’re hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (zones 3 to 9).
Plant in full sun or, in areas with warm summers, in a spot where they’ll get light shade or filtered afternoon sun. The soil should be neutral to slightly acidic, and unlike most irises, they don’t mind wet feet. Plant 2 inches deep and 1 feet apart in moist, neutral to acidic soil, with the leaf ends pointed in the direction you want them to grow. You can also plant up to three rhizomes in a 12-inch container. September to November is the best time to plant, but they can be set out in spring as well.
Provide ample neutral to acidic water throughout the growing and blooming period. Divide in fall when they get crowded.
Louisiana iris. Sometimes called swamp iris, Louisiana iris does well in more humid conditions. It does best in zones 3 to 9 and can be happy in climates as diverse as those of southern South Dakota, Maine, Hawaii and Florida. Louisiana irises reach 2 to 5 feet tall. The flowers come in almost as large a color selection as bearded irises, with blooms appearing in May and June.
Plant in August and September. Look for a location in full sun with rich, well-watered, neutral to acidic soil. Like Japanese irises, they can handle growing in water. If your summer afternoons are hot, provide light or filtered shade. Soak the rhizomes and plant them about 1 inch deep and 12 to 18 inches apart. Provide regular water and add mulch in late fall if the ground freezes in winter.
Pacific Coast iris. Pacific Coast irises are perfect additions to woodland and rock gardens. These West Coast natives and their growing number of hybrids are noted for their slender foliage and flower stems reaching 8 to 24 inches tall, as well as their flowering period, which can last from January to June. They do best in zones 7 to 10.
These irises need full sun and very well-draining soil; you may need to grow them in raised beds if you have clay soil. You can plant from containers at any time, preferably in spring or fall, but October is the prime time for planting rhizomes; plant about 1 to 2 inches deep and a foot apart. Provide moderate water while they’re growing and none in the summer.
Divide when new roots are forming, which will be anytime from early fall to midwinter; you’ll need to scrape away the soil to check on the roots.
Siberian iris. This iris has grassy foliage that grows from 1 foot to 3 feet tall and flowers in shades of white, purple, pink, blue and even light yellow, on stems ranging from 14 inches to almost 4 feet tall. Expect between two and five flowers on each stem in June and July. Siberian irises are hardy to minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 34.4 degrees Celsius (zones 4 to 8). They look their best when planted in clumps.
Plant in late summer (or early spring) in cold-winter regions. Wait until fall if you live where summers are hot and winters are mild or moderate. Choose a spot in full sun or with light afternoon shade if summers are hot. Siberian irises do best with neutral to acidic soil. Set the rhizomes about 1 to 2 inches deep and space them 1 foot to 2 feet apart. Water thoroughly after planting, and provide plenty of water when plants are growing and blooming; cut back after that. Divide in late summer or fall when the centers of the clumps no longer produce.
Spuria iris. It would be easy to mistake spuria irises for Dutch irises. Their leaves reach 3 to 4 feet tall and, thanks to hybridizing, flower colors range from yellows and bronzes to reds, purples and grays in late spring and early summer. These irises are hardy to 10 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 23.3 degrees Celsius (zones 6 to 9).
Plant rhizomes in late summer or early fall. Choose a spot in full sun with neutral to slightly alkaline soil. Set rhizomes 2 inches deep and 1 to 3 feet apart. Provide regular water while they’re growing and blooming, but spuria irises do best with almost no water in summer. Add fertilizer in early spring and fall. Provide winter protection if temperatures drop consistently below freezing. Divide in late summer or early fall only when they become overcrowded.
Origin: The Mediterranean, especially Spain, Russia, the Caucasus and northern Iran, depending on species
Where they will grow: Hardy to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 23 degrees Celsius (zones 6 to 9)
Water requirement: Regular to ample water while plants are growing and flowering
When to plant: Varies by species
Dutch, Spanish, English and reticulata irises all grow from true bulbs, which become dormant in summer. All of these are beardless. Dutch iris may have the highest name recognition, but reticulata irises are also popular.
Dutch and Spanish irises. These are the familiar irises sold by florists. They come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, orange, blue, purple and brown, as well as bicolors. The flowers are held on stems that reach about 1 to 2 feet high. Bloom times range from March in warmer climates to May or June in colder climates. Spanish iris are similar, though with smaller flowers and a bloom time that begins about two weeks after that of Dutch irises.
Plant both in October and November in a spot with full sun and well-draining soil. Set bulbs 4 inches deep and 3 to 4 inches apart. Add mulch for winter protection in cold-winter areas. Water generously when the plants are growing and blooming, then don’t water at all during their summer dormancy. If needed, dig up the bulbs after the foliage has finished and store them in a cool, dry place before replanting.
English iris. These irises are similar to their Dutch and Spanish cousins, but have broader flowers and summer blooms. They can also handle some summer water.
Plant in fall in a spot in full sun or with afternoon shade in the hottest climates and with cool, moist, acidic soil. Set bulbs 3 to 4 inches deep and 4 inches apart. Provide ample water during the growing season. In regions where summers are wet, you may want to dig these up and replant.
Reticulata iris. This is a small iris, usually not reaching more than 8 inches high, with equally small blossoms. Reticulata irises are perfect for containers, edgings and rock gardens. They’re also unusual in that the leaves may not appear until after the flowers bloom. Violet, blue-violet and white flowers are the norm in late spring and summer, although there is a species with yellow flowers.
Plant in fall in a spot in full sun with well-draining soil. Set them 3 to 4 inches deep and 3 to 4 inches apart. Provide regular water from fall through spring, but let the soil stay dry in the summer; you may need to dig and store the plants if you get summer rains. Watch out for snails and slugs.
How to use them. Plant in drifts or clumps for a natural look or intersperse with other spring-flowering annuals, perennials and bulbs in garden beds and borders. Smaller irises, such as reticulata irises, can be grown in containers or nestled into rock gardens. Choose a single color to make a statement, or mix and match for a cheerful array.

"One day in the pharmacy, a girl comes to the counter requesting a refill for her birth control. We pulled up her profile and realized we couldn’t refill it because she just got a 28-day fill less than 2 weeks ago. When we asked what happened to the other one, she said she was out. Apparently, both her and her boyfriend were each taking a pill each and was adamant that was how they needed to prevent pregnancy.
Emergency surgeon here
Got called 2 a.m. because a patient demanded to see me because “her daughters farts smelled too bad”
Kept a straight face.
A friend of mine mistakenly called her gynecologist instead of her dentist to make an appointment, and started the call by admitting she was overdue for a cleaning…
A woman came in for a baby check with her 6-month-old and she had what looked like chocolate milk in the baby’s bottle. So I started explaining to her as kindly as I could that she shouldn’t be giving her baby chocolate milk. At which point she interrupts me and says, “Oh that isn’t chocolate milk. It’s coffee! He just loves it!”
Guy comes into the emergency department via Ambulance with burns on his lower extremities. His shoes are charred and the bottoms of his pants are definitely burned away but his skin isn’t so bad. He had been trying to use a propane-powered weed burner in his yard (think flame thrower) and things got a little out of control. I smelled alcohol on his breath so I asked the guy if he had been drinking and he looked me directly in the eye and said, “Nooooo”. I got drunk just standing next to him. It was a once in a lifetime set up and I couldn’t help myself. As straight faced and professionally as possible I said, “Sir…liar, liar, pants on fire”. The paramedics all turned at once and ran out of the room they were laughing so hard! The patient just stared at me. He was so drunk it went totally over his head.
I once saw a high school aged kid come in with a dinner candle stuck in his rectum. He reportedly was using it to reach an itch. Apparently the itch was in his spleen because that thing was deep. Mom told me the story, and how she had previously asked him to not itch himself with other things of hers. I didn’t ask for any more details. I honestly think she believed that he was just really itchy.
The doctor explained to his patient that she suffered from inflammation of the cervix. Concerned, she demanded that he test her husband for it too.
The doctor assured her, “I’m positive your husband does not have cervicitis.”
She shot back, “How do you know? You haven’t examined him yet.”
Had a female patient. Her mom asked me to adjust her scrotum. Trying not to burst out laughing, I said “Your daughter’s scrotum?” She acted like I was stupid and pointed to the back of her neck.
I knew she wouldn’t listen as she was so convinced so I stopped arguing with her. And I also wanted her to go around saying it to other people.
So, not a doctor but I work at a hospital. We had someone come into A&E because they needed their nails redoing… They genuinely thought it was a good idea to go to accident and emergency to have their fake nails taken off and redone because they had gotten too long and become uncomfortable.
I’ve had a patient claim that amputations run in his family.
He said that was the only reason he needed both legs taken off above the knee. He was adamant that it was not actually due to his uncontrolled diabetes, his enormous and continual sugar intake, his refusal to use insulin, or his refusal of treatment for the giant infected wounds on both feet.",1

Introductory sentence: You need to write a sentence in the very beginning of the essay. This sentence tends to act as the charm for the reader. If the line is good then it builds the interest of the reader. On the other side of the fence if the line is not so attractive then it tends to ruin even a bit of interest that the reader might have had in the beginning. You can use a phrase or an idiom as the opening line of your essay.
Rephrasing: The next important step in writing an introduction is the rephrasing of the essay topic. This serves the purpose of giving the clarity of the essay topic to the reader.

Viewpoint: Giving your own viewpoint in the third line of the introduction plays a pivotal role in the effectiveness of the introduction. This tends to inform the reader that what he is supposed to read in the upcoming paragraphs. This line should clearly mention your point of view with reference to the question of the essay.
All these are the little parts of the introduction which when put together makes the introduction effective. In your introduction you should write as much as is required. Do not mention any such thing that can cause repetition in rest of the paragraphs.",1

This has to be the best thing to do with a onesie once your baby has outgrown it. Artists and crafty moms are turning those old baby clothes into teddy bears and parents are loving them! These so-called “memory bears” are keepsakes that can be cherished by parents and kids for years to come. There are other animals you can try, too!
Check out some of these examples from Etsy where artists turn those tiny outfits into precious, creative bears that your kids can cuddle with. This bear by ImaginationAcresLLC is covered with bunnies. We love how the artist even preserved those adorable bunny feet!
This handmade bear by CrazyLeggies is made from a cupcake-themed onesie! So adorable.
How about this bear, covered with turtles. The blue ribbon is a perfect touch! Wait, is every onesie required to have an animal print?
Remember we said you can morph baby clothes into other animals as well? Check out this stuffed elephant made from a single sailing-themed onesie. You would never know!
Typically, you are responsible for sending the garment you want the designer to use. But, you don’t necessarily have to pay someone else to make you a memory bear.
For something really special, parents often make a memory bear from the outfit their little bundle of joy was wearing when he or she left the hospital. We promise, that will never end up buried in the attic!

"FOR corporate high-flyers, being sent on an executive education programme once meant deserting the office for a couple of weeks and decamping to a plush business school campus. For those involved, such courses were part self-improvement, part jolly. Firms not only hoped to equip their best and brightest with new skills, but also to reward them by giving them the chance to rub shoulders with universities’ star professors and other high-performing executives.
Those days could be numbered. Today, a global executive education programme can be largely taken from the comfort of one’s home. Participants, too busy to take time away from the office, tune in from anywhere in the world via video-conferencing, without setting foot on campus. Too often the result is a passive experience. Pre-recorded lectures are common, and video-conferencing systems lag, limiting interaction between participants. Business schools use the case method, which thrives on group discussion. Online students miss the many fruitful interactions that happen informally on campus.
So some business schools are trying to replicate the campus experience using virtual reality (VR). Yet here, too, the pioneers often find the technology lacking. The Stockholm School of Economics, for example, gave executive students Samsung Gear VR headsets that enabled them to interact in a virtual classroom. But while headsets worked well for simple exchanges, high latency (the delay between users moving their heads and the headset’s response to the movement) limited the flow of discussions. Faculty, meanwhile, found setting up the devices labourious, reducing teaching time.",0
